''Slashing Reginleiv''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]; it was not released in the West. The story, based on [[Norse mythology]], follows the divine warriors Freyr and Freyja in their war against the [[J\u00f6tunn]], which heralds the coming of [[Ragnarok]]. Gameplay is mission-based, following one of the two protagonists as they fight hoards of enemies. Missions can be completed either in single-playing or in four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Along with standard controls, the game supported the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion.\n\nDevelopment of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' began in 2006, though the concept was pitched before the Wii's launch. The world and characters' Norse origins were chosen due to that system's uncertain visual identity. The last year of production was turbulent due to requests from Nintendo about the controls and inclusion of co-op. It was the first Nintendo-published game given the \"D\" rating by Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] rating system. The game was among the best-selling Wii titles of the year in Japan, but met with mixed reviews in both Japan and overseas.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Zangeki no Reginleiv gameplay.png|thumb|left|A mission in ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', featuring four players in the online co-op mode.]]\n''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] set in a world inspired by [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Players take on the role of sibling deities Freyr and Freyja, completing missions that involve defeating waves of enemy troops.<ref name=\"SilOpinion\"/><ref name=\"ReginleivSystem\"/> The game has two control options; the Classic Controller, and the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].

In response to this attack, Asgard dispatches the twin deities Freyr and Freyja to aid humanity in defeating the giants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/rznj/story/index.html|script-title=ja:\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\uff1a\u795e\u8a71|language=Japanese|website=Zangeki no Reginleiv official website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323053852/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/rznj/story/index.html|archivedate=2015-03-23|url-status=live}}</ref> As the battles escalate, it becomes clear that the apocalypse [[Ragnarok]] is immanent. Despite their best efforts, Freyr and Freyja cannot stop the J\u00f6tunn's advance. The situation is worsened by the emerging armies of [[Niflheim]] and [[Muspelheim]], and the release of three demonic weapons created by [[Loki]] during an earlier war with the giants. Asgard itself is eventually assaulted leading to the death of all the gods except Freyr and Freyja, followed by the final emergence of the Fire J\u00f6tunn [[Surtr]]. The world is left in ruin after Surt's defeat, but Freyja uses her powers to restore the world and humanity. The post-credits scene shows a modern world, where the gods have reincarnated as humans.\n\n==Development==\n[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]], best known for their work on the ''[[Earth Defense Force]]'' series, first pitched the concept of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' to [[Nintendo]] in 2004 alongside a project for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG''. Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami was wary of such a large pitch, so agreed that the developer would make ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' and then go on to ''Zangeki no Reginleiv''. When production of ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' finished in 2006, the team were given the go-ahead to work on ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', though both sides were wary of its scale. Originally the plan was for only 100 weapons to feature, but as the team got to grips with the Wii hardware, the number tripled. In 2009, a year before the planned release, Nintendo asked Sandlot to include co-op\u2014which the team had never tried before\u2014then control options for the Classic Controller and the Wii MotionPlus. These additional elements put a lot of strain on the team, with Yamagami describing it as a \"dark year\" for the team. A point of contention with Nintendo during the final six months was allowing a player to dismember enemies. Instead of cutting it altogether, Sandlot and Nintendo rationalised that since the violence was against hostile supernatural beings, it did not go against Nintendo's policy of not showing excessive violence against people.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u793e\u9577\u304c\u8a0a\u304f\u300e\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\u300f|language=Japanese|website=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310073743/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe early concept focused simply on making a fun game where players could slash at enemies, with the setting being a secondary consideration. Writer and director Takehiro Homma initially considered ancient Japan and a modern-day setting, but settled on a mythological setting to better explain the fantastic feats on display. Norse mythology was chosen as the world's base due to lacking a distinct visual identity when compared to [[Greek mythology]]. With this in mind, levels were designed to reflect the topography of the mythos as much as possible. Illustrator Haccan, who designed the main characters, was brought in as art director Masatsugu Igarashi liked his human character designs.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/> Character model design was assisted by Optimo Graphico, an outsourcing company also working on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Zangeki no Reginleiv|developer=[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|platform=[[Wii]]|date=2010-02-11|scene=Credits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30aa\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30b3\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e - Works|language=Japanese|website=Optimo Graphico website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031145853/http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|archivedate=2010-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music was composed by [[Masafumi Takada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5408\u540c\u4f1a\u793e|website=Masafumi Takada website|accessdate=2016-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213116/http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|archivedate=2016-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Different voice clips were recorded for different battle situations, with the number and harshness causing the actors' voices to become hoarse by the end of recording.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe game was first announced at a special Nintendo press event in 2008 under the provisional title ''Dynamic Zan'', with a planned release for the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|script-title=ja:\u6012\u6fe4\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u5927\u5145\u5b9f|language=Japanese|website=[[Famitsu]]|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014436/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|archivedate=2010-02-13|url-status=live}}</ref> It was re-introduced under its official title in November 2009.

''Slashing Reginleiv''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]. The story, based on [[Norse mythology]], follows the divine warriors Freyr and Freyja in their war against the [[J\u00f6tunn]], which heralds the coming of [[Ragnarok]]. Gameplay is mission-based, following one of the two protagonists as they fight hoards of enemies. Missions can be completed either in single-playing or in four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Along with standard controls, the game supported the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion.\n\nDevelopment of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' began in 2006, though the concept was pitched before the Wii's launch. The world and characters' Norse origins were chosen due to that system's uncertain visual identity. The last year of production was turbulent due to requests from Nintendo about the controls and inclusion of co-op. It was the first Nintendo-published game given the \"D\" rating by Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] rating system. As of 2020, the game remains exclusive to Japan. The game saw a mixed reception, and low sales in Japan.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Zangeki no Reginleiv gameplay.png|thumb|left|A mission in ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', featuring four players in the online co-op mode.]]\n''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] set in a world inspired by [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Players take on the role of sibling deities Freyr and Freyja, completing missions that involve defeating waves of enemy troops.<ref name=\"SilOpinion\"/><ref name=\"ReginleivSystem\"/> The game has two control options; the Classic Controller, and the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].

Despite their best efforts, Freyr and Freyja cannot stop the J\u00f6tunn's advance. The situation is worsened by the emerging armies of [[Niflheim]] and [[Muspelheim]], and the release of three demonic weapons created by [[Loki]] during an earlier war with the giants. Asgard itself is eventually assaulted leading to the death of all the gods except Freyr and Freyja, followed by the final emergence of the Fire J\u00f6tunn [[Surtr]]. The world is left in ruin after Surt's defeat, but Freyja uses her powers to restore the world and humanity. The post-credits scene shows a modern world, where the gods have reincarnated as humans.\n\n==Development and release==\n[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]], best known for their work on the ''[[Earth Defense Force]]'' series, first pitched the concept of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' to [[Nintendo]] in 2004 alongside a project for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG''. Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami was wary of such a large pitch, so agreed that the developer would make ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' and then go on to ''Zangeki no Reginleiv''. When production of ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' finished in 2006, the team were given the go-ahead to work on ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', though both sides were wary of its scale. Originally the plan was for only 100 weapons to feature, but as the team got to grips with the Wii hardware, the number tripled. In 2009, a year before the planned release, Nintendo asked Sandlot to include co-op\u2014which the team had never tried before\u2014then control options for the Classic Controller and the Wii MotionPlus. These additional elements put a lot of strain on the team, with Yamagami describing it as a \"dark year\" for the team. A point of contention with Nintendo during the final six months was allowing a player to dismember enemies. Instead of cutting it altogether, Sandlot and Nintendo rationalised that since the violence was against hostile supernatural beings, it did not go against Nintendo's policy of not showing excessive violence against people.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u793e\u9577\u304c\u8a0a\u304f\u300e\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\u300f|language=Japanese|website=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310073743/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe early concept focused simply on making a fun game where players could slash at enemies, with the setting being a secondary consideration. Writer and director Takehiro Homma initially considered ancient Japan and a modern-day setting, but settled on a mythological setting to better explain the fantastic feats on display. Norse mythology was chosen as the world's base due to lacking a distinct visual identity when compared to [[Greek mythology]]. With this in mind, levels were designed to reflect the topography of the mythos as much as possible. Illustrator Haccan, who designed the main characters, was brought in as art director Masatsugu Igarashi liked his human character designs.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/> Character model design was assisted by Optimo Graphico, an outsourcing company also working on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Zangeki no Reginleiv|developer=[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|platform=[[Wii]]|date=2010-02-11|scene=Credits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30aa\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30b3\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e - Works|language=Japanese|website=Optimo Graphico website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031145853/http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|archivedate=2010-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music was composed by [[Masafumi Takada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5408\u540c\u4f1a\u793e|website=Masafumi Takada website|accessdate=2016-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213116/http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|archivedate=2016-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Different voice clips were recorded for different battle situations, with the number and harshness causing the actors' voices to become hoarse by the end of recording.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was first announced at a special Nintendo press event in 2008 under the provisional title ''Dynamic Zan'', with a planned release for the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|script-title=ja:\u6012\u6fe4\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u5927\u5145\u5b9f|language=Japanese|website=[[Famitsu]]|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014436/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|archivedate=2010-02-13|url-status=live}}</ref> It was re-introduced under its official title in November 2009.

While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser [[cutting]] works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The [[laser optics]] and [[CNC]] (computer numerical control) are used  to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A commercial laser for cutting materials involved a motion control system to follow a CNC or [[G-code]] of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the  material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,<ref>Oberg, p. 1447.</ref> leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. \n\n== History ==\nIn 1965, the first production laser cutting machine was used to [[drilling|drill]] holes in [[diamond]] [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]]. This machine was made by the [[Western Electric Engineering Research Center]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bromberg|1991|p=202}}</ref> In 1967, the British pioneered laser-assisted oxygen jet cutting for metals.<ref>The early days of laser cutting, par P. A. Hilton, 11th Nordic Conference in Laser Processing of Materials, Lappeenranta, Finland, August 20\u201322, 2007, http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/the-early-days-of-laser-cutting-august-2007</ref> In the early 1970s, this technology was put into production to cut titanium for aerospace applications. At the same time {{CO2}} lasers were adapted to cut non-metals, such as [[textiles]], because, at the time, {{CO2}} lasers were not powerful enough to overcome the [[thermal conductivity]] of metals.<ref>CHEO, P. K. \"Chapter 2: {{CO2}} Lasers.\" UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley, n.d. Web. 14 Jan. 2015.</ref> Laser cutting is boring and a waste of time\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Laser-and-CNC-Control.jpg|thumb|Industrial laser cutting of steel with cutting instructions programmed through the CNC interface]]\n\nGeneration of the [[laser]] beam involves stimulating a lasing material by electrical discharges or lamps within a closed container. As the lasing material is stimulated, the beam is reflected internally by means of a partial mirror, until it achieves sufficient energy to escape as a stream of monochromatic coherent light. Mirrors or fiber optics are typically used to direct the [[coherent light]] to a lens, which focuses the light at the work zone. The narrowest part of the focused beam is generally less than {{convert|0.0125|in}}. in diameter. Depending upon material thickness, [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] widths as small as {{convert|0.004|in}} are possible.<ref>Todd, p. 185.</ref> In order to be able to start cutting from somewhere other than the edge, a pierce is done before every cut. Piercing usually involves a high-power pulsed laser beam which slowly makes a hole in the material, taking around 5\u201315 seconds for {{convert|0.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[stainless steel]], for example.\n\nThe parallel rays of coherent light from the laser source often fall in the range between {{convert|0.06|-|0.08|in}} in diameter. This beam is normally focused and intensified by a lens or a mirror to a very small spot of about {{convert|0.001|in}} to create a very intense laser beam. In order to achieve the smoothest possible finish during contour cutting, the direction of beam [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] must be rotated as it goes around the periphery of a contoured workpiece. For sheet metal cutting, the focal length is usually {{convert|1.5|-|3|in}}.<ref>Todd, p. 188.</ref>\n\nAdvantages of laser cutting over [[mechanical cutting]] include easier workholding and reduced contamination of workpiece (since there is no cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better, since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small [[heat-affected zone]]. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.\n\nLaser cutting for metals has the advantages over [[plasma cutting]] of being more precise and using less energy when cutting sheet metal; however, most industrial lasers cannot cut through the greater metal thickness that plasma can. Newer laser machines operating at higher power (6000 watts, as contrasted with early laser cutting machines' 1500 watt ratings) are approaching plasma machines in their ability to cut through thick materials, but the capital cost of such machines is much higher than that of plasma cutting machines capable of cutting thick materials like steel plate.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:HACO fiber laser cutting machine.jpg|alt=HACO fiber laser cutting machine|thumb|HACO fiber laser cutting machine with an integrated loading and unloading system.]]\n[[File:CNC Laser Cutting Machine.jpg|thumb|4000&nbsp;watt {{CO2}} laser cutter]]\n\nThere are three main types of lasers used in laser cutting. The [[CO2 laser|{{CO2}} laser]] is suited for cutting, boring, and engraving. The [[neodymium]] (Nd) and neodymium [[yttrium-aluminium-garnet]] ([[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]]) lasers are identical in style and differ only in application. Nd is used for boring and where high energy but low repetition are required. The Nd:YAG laser is used where very high power is needed and for boring and engraving. Both {{CO2}} and Nd/Nd:YAG lasers can be used for [[welding]].<ref name=\"Todd, p. 186\">Todd, p. 186.</ref>\n\n{{CO2}} lasers are commonly \"pumped\" by passing a current through the gas mix (DC-excited) or using radio frequency energy (RF-excited). The [[Dielectric heating|RF method]] is newer and has become more popular. Since DC designs require electrodes inside the cavity, they can encounter electrode erosion and plating of electrode material on [[glass]]ware and [[optics]]. Since RF resonators have external electrodes they are not prone to those problems.\n{{CO2}} lasers are used for industrial cutting of many materials including titanium, stainless steel, mild steel, aluminium, plastic, wood, engineered wood, wax, fabrics, and paper. YAG lasers are primarily used for cutting and scribing metals and ceramics.\n\nIn addition to the power source, the type of gas flow can affect performance as well. Common variants of {{CO2}} lasers include fast axial flow, slow axial flow, transverse flow, and slab. In a fast axial flow resonator, the mixture of carbon dioxide, helium and nitrogen is circulated at high velocity by a turbine or blower. Transverse flow lasers circulate the gas mix at a lower velocity, requiring a simpler blower. Slab or diffusion cooled resonators have a static gas field that requires no pressurization or glassware, leading to savings on replacement turbines and glassware.\n\nThe laser generator and external optics (including the focus lens) require cooling. Depending on system size and configuration, waste heat may be transferred by a coolant or directly to air. Water is a commonly used coolant, usually circulated through a chiller or heat transfer system.\n\nA ''laser microjet'' is a water-jet guided [[laser]] in which a pulsed laser beam is coupled into a low-pressure water jet. This is used to perform laser cutting functions while using the water jet to guide the laser beam, much like an optical fiber, through total internal reflection. The advantages of this are that the water also removes debris and cools the material. Additional advantages over traditional \"dry\" laser cutting are high dicing speeds, parallel [[wikt:kerf|kerf]], and omnidirectional cutting.<ref name=\"SPIE\">Perrottet, D et al.,\"Heat damage-free Laser-Microjet cutting achieves highest die fracture strength\", ''Photon Processing in Microelectronics and Photonics IV'', edited by J. Fieret, et al., Proc. SPIE Vol. 5713 (SPIE, Bellingham, WA, 2005)</ref>\n\n[[Fiber laser|Fiber lasers]] are a type of solid state laser that is rapidly growing within the metal cutting industry. Unlike {{CO2}}, Fiber technology utilizes a solid gain medium, as opposed to a gas or liquid. The \u201cseed laser\u201d produces the laser beam and is then amplified within a glass fiber. With a wavelength of only 1.064 micrometers fiber lasers produce an extremely small spot size (up to 100 times smaller compared to the {{CO2}}) making it ideal for cutting reflective metal material. This is one of the main advantages of Fiber compared to {{CO2}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bosslaser.com/blog/how-fiber-laser-technology-compares-to-co2/|title=How Fiber Laser Technology Compares to {{CO2}} - Boss Laser Blog|date=2017-05-22|work=Boss Laser Blog|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThere are many different methods in cutting using lasers, with different types used to cut different material. Some of the methods are vaporization, melt and blow, melt blow and burn, thermal stress cracking, scribing, cold cutting and burning stabilized laser cutting.\n\n===Vaporization cutting===\nIn vaporization cutting the focused beam heats the surface of the material to boiling point and generates a keyhole. The keyhole leads to a sudden increase in [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorptivity]] quickly deepening the hole. As the hole deepens and the material boils, vapor generated erodes the molten walls blowing ejecta out and further enlarging the hole. Non melting material such as wood, carbon and thermoset plastics are usually cut by this method.\n\n===Melt and blow===\nMelt and blow or fusion cutting uses high-pressure gas to blow molten material from the cutting area, greatly decreasing the power requirement. First the material is heated to melting point then a gas jet blows the molten material out of the kerf avoiding the need to raise the temperature of the material any further. Materials cut with this process are usually metals.\n\n===Thermal stress cracking===\nBrittle materials are particularly sensitive to thermal fracture, a feature exploited in thermal stress cracking. A beam is focused on the surface causing localized heating and thermal expansion. This results in a crack that can then be guided by moving the beam. The crack can be moved in order of m/s. It is usually used in cutting of glass.\n\n===Stealth dicing of silicon wafers===\n{{further|Wafer dicing}}\nThe separation of [[microelectronic]] chips as prepared in [[semiconductor device fabrication]] from [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]] may be performed by the so-called stealth dicing process, which operates with a pulsed [[Nd:YAG laser]], the wavelength of which (1064&nbsp;nm) is well adopted to the electronic [[band gap]] of [[silicon]] (1.11 [[Electronvolt|eV]] or 1117&nbsp;nm). \n\n===Reactive cutting===\nAlso called \"burning stabilized laser gas cutting\", \"flame cutting\". Reactive cutting is like oxygen torch cutting but with a laser beam as the ignition source. Mostly used for cutting carbon steel in thicknesses over 1&nbsp;mm. This process can be used to cut very thick steel plates with relatively little laser power.\n\n== Tolerances and surface finish ==\nLaser cutters have positioning accuracy of 10 micrometers and repeatability of 5 micrometers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nStandard [[Surface roughness|roughness]] Rz increases with the sheet thickness, but decreases with laser power and [[cutting speed]]. When cutting low carbon steel with laser power of 800 W, standard roughness Rz is 10&nbsp;\u03bcm for sheet thickness of 1&nbsp;mm, 20&nbsp;\u03bcm for 3&nbsp;mm, and 25&nbsp;\u03bcm for 6&nbsp;mm. \n\n<math display=\"block\">Rz = \\frac{ 12.528 \\cdot S^{0.542} }{ P^{0.528} \\cdot V^{0.322} }</math>\n\nWhere: <math>S =</math> steel sheet thickness in mm; <math>P =</math> laser power in kW (some new laser cutters have laser power of 4&nbsp;kW); <math>V =</math> cutting speed in meters per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.om.ugal.ro/AnnalsFasc8Tribology/pdf/2006/13-Annals2006-Radovanovic.pdf|title=Research on surface roughness by laser cut by Miroslav Radovanovic and Predrag Da\u0161i\u0107|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThis process is capable of holding quite close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], often to within 0.001&nbsp;inch (0.025&nbsp;mm). Part geometry and the mechanical soundness of the machine have much to do with tolerance capabilities. The typical surface finish resulting from laser beam cutting may range from 125 to 250 micro-inches (0.003&nbsp;mm to 0.006&nbsp;mm).<ref name=\"Todd, p. 186\"/>\n\n== Machine configurations ==\n[[File:Dual Pallet Flying Optics Laser.jpg|thumb|Dual-pallet flying optics laser]]\n[[File:Industrial 4kW laser with flying optics system.jpg|thumb|Flying optics laser head]]\n\nThere are generally three different configurations of industrial laser cutting machines: moving material, hybrid, and flying optics systems. These refer to the way that the laser beam is moved over the material to be cut or processed. For all of these, the axes of motion are typically designated X and Y [[Coordinate axis|axis]]. If the cutting head may be controlled, it is designated as the Z-axis.\n\nMoving material lasers have a stationary cutting head and move the material under it. This method provides a constant distance from the laser generator to the workpiece and a single point from which to remove cutting effluent. It requires fewer optics, but requires moving the workpiece. This style machine tends to have the fewest beam delivery optics, but also tends to be the slowest.\n\nHybrid lasers provide a table which moves in one axis (usually the X-axis) and move the head along the shorter (Y) axis. This results in a more constant beam delivery path length than a flying optic machine and may permit a simpler beam delivery system. This can result in reduced power loss in the delivery system and more capacity per watt than flying optics machines.\n\nFlying optics lasers feature a stationary table and a cutting head (with laser beam) that moves over the workpiece in both of the horizontal dimensions. Flying optics cutters keep the workpiece stationary during processing and often do not require material clamping. The moving mass is constant, so dynamics are not affected by varying size of the workpiece. Flying optics machines are the fastest type, which is advantageous when cutting thinner workpieces.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRah71xUxbMC&pg=PA38|title=Laser Cutting Guide for Manufacturing|last=Caristan|first=Charles L.|date=2004|publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers|isbn=9780872636866|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFlying optic machines must use some method to take into account the changing beam length from near field (close to resonator) cutting to far field (far away from resonator) cutting. Common methods for controlling this include collimation, adaptive optics or the use of a constant beam length axis.\n\n[[Multiaxis machining|Five and six-axis machines]] also permit cutting formed workpieces. In addition, there are various methods of orienting the laser beam to a shaped workpiece, maintaining a proper focus distance and nozzle standoff, etc.\n\n=== Pulsing ===\n[[Pulsed lasers]] which provide a high-power burst of energy for a short period are very effective in some laser cutting processes, particularly for piercing, or when very small holes or very low cutting speeds are required, since if a constant laser beam were used, the heat could reach the point of melting the whole piece being cut.\n\nMost industrial lasers have the ability to pulse or cut CW (continuous wave) under NC ([[numerical control]]) program control.\n\nDouble pulse lasers use a series of pulse pairs to improve [[material removal rate]] and hole quality.

While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser [[cutting]] works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The [[laser optics]] and [[CNC]] (computer numerical control) are used  to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A commercial laser for cutting materials involved a motion control system to follow a CNC or [[G-code]] of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the  material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,<ref>Oberg, p. 1447.</ref> leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. \n\n== History ==\nIn 1965, the first production laser cutting machine was used to [[drilling|drill]] holes in [[diamond]] [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]]. This machine was made by the [[Western Electric Engineering Research Center]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bromberg|1991|p=202}}</ref> In 1967, the British pioneered laser-assisted oxygen jet cutting for metals.<ref>The early days of laser cutting, par P. A. Hilton, 11th Nordic Conference in Laser Processing of Materials, Lappeenranta, Finland, August 20\u201322, 2007, http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/the-early-days-of-laser-cutting-august-2007</ref> In the early 1970s, this technology was put into production to cut titanium for aerospace applications. At the same time {{CO2}} lasers were adapted to cut non-metals, such as [[textiles]], because, at the time, {{CO2}} lasers were not powerful enough to overcome the [[thermal conductivity]] of metals.<ref>CHEO, P. K. \"Chapter 2: {{CO2}} Lasers.\" UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley, n.d. Web. 14 Jan. 2015.</ref>\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Laser-and-CNC-Control.jpg|thumb|Industrial laser cutting of steel with cutting instructions programmed through the CNC interface]]\n\nGeneration of the [[laser]] beam involves stimulating a lasing material by electrical discharges or lamps within a closed container. As the lasing material is stimulated, the beam is reflected internally by means of a partial mirror, until it achieves sufficient energy to escape as a stream of monochromatic coherent light. Mirrors or fiber optics are typically used to direct the [[coherent light]] to a lens, which focuses the light at the work zone. The narrowest part of the focused beam is generally less than {{convert|0.0125|in}}. in diameter. Depending upon material thickness, [[wikt:kerf|kerf]] widths as small as {{convert|0.004|in}} are possible.<ref>Todd, p. 185.</ref> In order to be able to start cutting from somewhere other than the edge, a pierce is done before every cut. Piercing usually involves a high-power pulsed laser beam which slowly makes a hole in the material, taking around 5\u201315 seconds for {{convert|0.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[stainless steel]], for example.\n\nThe parallel rays of coherent light from the laser source often fall in the range between {{convert|0.06|-|0.08|in}} in diameter. This beam is normally focused and intensified by a lens or a mirror to a very small spot of about {{convert|0.001|in}} to create a very intense laser beam. In order to achieve the smoothest possible finish during contour cutting, the direction of beam [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] must be rotated as it goes around the periphery of a contoured workpiece. For sheet metal cutting, the focal length is usually {{convert|1.5|-|3|in}}.<ref>Todd, p. 188.</ref>\n\nAdvantages of laser cutting over [[mechanical cutting]] include easier workholding and reduced contamination of workpiece (since there is no cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better, since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small [[heat-affected zone]]. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.\n\nLaser cutting for metals has the advantages over [[plasma cutting]] of being more precise and using less energy when cutting sheet metal; however, most industrial lasers cannot cut through the greater metal thickness that plasma can. Newer laser machines operating at higher power (6000 watts, as contrasted with early laser cutting machines' 1500 watt ratings) are approaching plasma machines in their ability to cut through thick materials, but the capital cost of such machines is much higher than that of plasma cutting machines capable of cutting thick materials like steel plate.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:HACO fiber laser cutting machine.jpg|alt=HACO fiber laser cutting machine|thumb|HACO fiber laser cutting machine with an integrated loading and unloading system.]]\n[[File:CNC Laser Cutting Machine.jpg|thumb|4000&nbsp;watt {{CO2}} laser cutter]]\n\nThere are three main types of lasers used in laser cutting. The [[CO2 laser|{{CO2}} laser]] is suited for cutting, boring, and engraving. The [[neodymium]] (Nd) and neodymium [[yttrium-aluminium-garnet]] ([[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]]) lasers are identical in style and differ only in application. Nd is used for boring and where high energy but low repetition are required. The Nd:YAG laser is used where very high power is needed and for boring and engraving. Both {{CO2}} and Nd/Nd:YAG lasers can be used for [[welding]].<ref name=\"Todd, p. 186\">Todd, p. 186.</ref>\n\n{{CO2}} lasers are commonly \"pumped\" by passing a current through the gas mix (DC-excited) or using radio frequency energy (RF-excited). The [[Dielectric heating|RF method]] is newer and has become more popular. Since DC designs require electrodes inside the cavity, they can encounter electrode erosion and plating of electrode material on [[glass]]ware and [[optics]]. Since RF resonators have external electrodes they are not prone to those problems.\n{{CO2}} lasers are used for industrial cutting of many materials including titanium, stainless steel, mild steel, aluminium, plastic, wood, engineered wood, wax, fabrics, and paper. YAG lasers are primarily used for cutting and scribing metals and ceramics.\n\nIn addition to the power source, the type of gas flow can affect performance as well. Common variants of {{CO2}} lasers include fast axial flow, slow axial flow, transverse flow, and slab. In a fast axial flow resonator, the mixture of carbon dioxide, helium and nitrogen is circulated at high velocity by a turbine or blower. Transverse flow lasers circulate the gas mix at a lower velocity, requiring a simpler blower. Slab or diffusion cooled resonators have a static gas field that requires no pressurization or glassware, leading to savings on replacement turbines and glassware.\n\nThe laser generator and external optics (including the focus lens) require cooling. Depending on system size and configuration, waste heat may be transferred by a coolant or directly to air. Water is a commonly used coolant, usually circulated through a chiller or heat transfer system.\n\nA ''laser microjet'' is a water-jet guided [[laser]] in which a pulsed laser beam is coupled into a low-pressure water jet. This is used to perform laser cutting functions while using the water jet to guide the laser beam, much like an optical fiber, through total internal reflection. The advantages of this are that the water also removes debris and cools the material. Additional advantages over traditional \"dry\" laser cutting are high dicing speeds, parallel [[wikt:kerf|kerf]], and omnidirectional cutting.<ref name=\"SPIE\">Perrottet, D et al.,\"Heat damage-free Laser-Microjet cutting achieves highest die fracture strength\", ''Photon Processing in Microelectronics and Photonics IV'', edited by J. Fieret, et al., Proc. SPIE Vol. 5713 (SPIE, Bellingham, WA, 2005)</ref>\n\n[[Fiber laser|Fiber lasers]] are a type of solid state laser that is rapidly growing within the metal cutting industry. Unlike {{CO2}}, Fiber technology utilizes a solid gain medium, as opposed to a gas or liquid. The \u201cseed laser\u201d produces the laser beam and is then amplified within a glass fiber. With a wavelength of only 1.064 micrometers fiber lasers produce an extremely small spot size (up to 100 times smaller compared to the {{CO2}}) making it ideal for cutting reflective metal material. This is one of the main advantages of Fiber compared to {{CO2}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bosslaser.com/blog/how-fiber-laser-technology-compares-to-co2/|title=How Fiber Laser Technology Compares to {{CO2}} - Boss Laser Blog|date=2017-05-22|work=Boss Laser Blog|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThere are many different methods in cutting using lasers, with different types used to cut different material. Some of the methods are vaporization, melt and blow, melt blow and burn, thermal stress cracking, scribing, cold cutting and burning stabilized laser cutting.\n\n===Vaporization cutting===\nIn vaporization cutting the focused beam heats the surface of the material to boiling point and generates a keyhole. The keyhole leads to a sudden increase in [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorptivity]] quickly deepening the hole. As the hole deepens and the material boils, vapor generated erodes the molten walls blowing ejecta out and further enlarging the hole. Non melting material such as wood, carbon and thermoset plastics are usually cut by this method.\n\n===Melt and blow===\nMelt and blow or fusion cutting uses high-pressure gas to blow molten material from the cutting area, greatly decreasing the power requirement. First the material is heated to melting point then a gas jet blows the molten material out of the kerf avoiding the need to raise the temperature of the material any further. Materials cut with this process are usually metals.\n\n===Thermal stress cracking===\nBrittle materials are particularly sensitive to thermal fracture, a feature exploited in thermal stress cracking. A beam is focused on the surface causing localized heating and thermal expansion. This results in a crack that can then be guided by moving the beam. The crack can be moved in order of m/s. It is usually used in cutting of glass.\n\n===Stealth dicing of silicon wafers===\n{{further|Wafer dicing}}\nThe separation of [[microelectronic]] chips as prepared in [[semiconductor device fabrication]] from [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]] may be performed by the so-called stealth dicing process, which operates with a pulsed [[Nd:YAG laser]], the wavelength of which (1064&nbsp;nm) is well adopted to the electronic [[band gap]] of [[silicon]] (1.11 [[Electronvolt|eV]] or 1117&nbsp;nm). \n\n===Reactive cutting===\nAlso called \"burning stabilized laser gas cutting\", \"flame cutting\". Reactive cutting is like oxygen torch cutting but with a laser beam as the ignition source. Mostly used for cutting carbon steel in thicknesses over 1&nbsp;mm. This process can be used to cut very thick steel plates with relatively little laser power.\n\n== Tolerances and surface finish ==\nLaser cutters have positioning accuracy of 10 micrometers and repeatability of 5 micrometers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nStandard [[Surface roughness|roughness]] Rz increases with the sheet thickness, but decreases with laser power and [[cutting speed]]. When cutting low carbon steel with laser power of 800 W, standard roughness Rz is 10&nbsp;\u03bcm for sheet thickness of 1&nbsp;mm, 20&nbsp;\u03bcm for 3&nbsp;mm, and 25&nbsp;\u03bcm for 6&nbsp;mm. \n\n<math display=\"block\">Rz = \\frac{ 12.528 \\cdot S^{0.542} }{ P^{0.528} \\cdot V^{0.322} }</math>\n\nWhere: <math>S =</math> steel sheet thickness in mm; <math>P =</math> laser power in kW (some new laser cutters have laser power of 4&nbsp;kW); <math>V =</math> cutting speed in meters per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.om.ugal.ro/AnnalsFasc8Tribology/pdf/2006/13-Annals2006-Radovanovic.pdf|title=Research on surface roughness by laser cut by Miroslav Radovanovic and Predrag Da\u0161i\u0107|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThis process is capable of holding quite close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], often to within 0.001&nbsp;inch (0.025&nbsp;mm). Part geometry and the mechanical soundness of the machine have much to do with tolerance capabilities. The typical surface finish resulting from laser beam cutting may range from 125 to 250 micro-inches (0.003&nbsp;mm to 0.006&nbsp;mm).<ref name=\"Todd, p. 186\"/>\n\n== Machine configurations ==\n[[File:Dual Pallet Flying Optics Laser.jpg|thumb|Dual-pallet flying optics laser]]\n[[File:Industrial 4kW laser with flying optics system.jpg|thumb|Flying optics laser head]]\n\nThere are generally three different configurations of industrial laser cutting machines: moving material, hybrid, and flying optics systems. These refer to the way that the laser beam is moved over the material to be cut or processed. For all of these, the axes of motion are typically designated X and Y [[Coordinate axis|axis]]. If the cutting head may be controlled, it is designated as the Z-axis.\n\nMoving material lasers have a stationary cutting head and move the material under it. This method provides a constant distance from the laser generator to the workpiece and a single point from which to remove cutting effluent. It requires fewer optics, but requires moving the workpiece. This style machine tends to have the fewest beam delivery optics, but also tends to be the slowest.\n\nHybrid lasers provide a table which moves in one axis (usually the X-axis) and move the head along the shorter (Y) axis. This results in a more constant beam delivery path length than a flying optic machine and may permit a simpler beam delivery system. This can result in reduced power loss in the delivery system and more capacity per watt than flying optics machines.\n\nFlying optics lasers feature a stationary table and a cutting head (with laser beam) that moves over the workpiece in both of the horizontal dimensions. Flying optics cutters keep the workpiece stationary during processing and often do not require material clamping. The moving mass is constant, so dynamics are not affected by varying size of the workpiece. Flying optics machines are the fastest type, which is advantageous when cutting thinner workpieces.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRah71xUxbMC&pg=PA38|title=Laser Cutting Guide for Manufacturing|last=Caristan|first=Charles L.|date=2004|publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers|isbn=9780872636866|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFlying optic machines must use some method to take into account the changing beam length from near field (close to resonator) cutting to far field (far away from resonator) cutting. Common methods for controlling this include collimation, adaptive optics or the use of a constant beam length axis.\n\n[[Multiaxis machining|Five and six-axis machines]] also permit cutting formed workpieces. In addition, there are various methods of orienting the laser beam to a shaped workpiece, maintaining a proper focus distance and nozzle standoff, etc.\n\n=== Pulsing ===\n[[Pulsed lasers]] which provide a high-power burst of energy for a short period are very effective in some laser cutting processes, particularly for piercing, or when very small holes or very low cutting speeds are required, since if a constant laser beam were used, the heat could reach the point of melting the whole piece being cut.\n\nMost industrial lasers have the ability to pulse or cut CW (continuous wave) under NC ([[numerical control]]) program control.\n\nDouble pulse lasers use a series of pulse pairs to improve [[material removal rate]] and hole quality. Essentially, the first pulse removes material from the surface and the second prevents the ejecta from adhering to the side of the hole or cut.<ref>{{ cite web |author= Forsman, A|url= //fusion.gat.com/pubs-ext/miscpubs/A25867.pdf | title = Superpulse A nanosecond pulse format to improve laser drilling |publisher= Photonics Spectra |date= June 2007 |accessdate= June 16, 2014 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n== Power consumption ==\nThe main disadvantage of laser cutting is the high power consumption.

{"title_page": "Laucala", "text_new": "'''Laucala'''  (pronounced {{IPA-fj|lau\u02c8\u00f0ala|}}) is one of a triplet of small islands that lie to the east of Thurston Point on the island of [[Taveuni]] in [[Fiji]]. The original inhabitants are the  people originally collectively known as the Vua-ni-Cau (Fruit of the Cau) that settled in Northern Taveuni, Qamea Island, Yanuca Island, Viubani Island, Qelelevu Island, Cikobia  Island Vanuabalavu Island and islands of Northern Lau before most of these islands were later redistributed during the colonial administration era on the advise of the council of chiefs under Ratu Sukuna (after the second Native Land Commission <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itaukeiaffairs.gov.fj/index.php/divisions/itaukei-lands-and-fisheries-commission|title=iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission|website=www.itaukeiaffairs.gov.fj|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>decision in possibly 1929, the first on 1905). \n\n'''Mai Vunibua - Ancestor of Laucala''' - Through folklore songs and stories (from Qaraniyaku elders) the people of Laucala originated from Nakauvadra through to Verata and migrated (during one of the waves of migrations by Lutunasobasoba and Ro-ko-Moutu) to Eastern Viti Levu. From Eastern and Northern Vitilevu and Verata the migration continued to Vanua Levu where political formations evolved and records by missionaries and other outsiders present in Fiji post 1840s.  \n\nThe people of Laucala were led by Mai Vunibua ( possibly Naulumatua from Bua after leaving his two sons in Bua) who finally settled in Northern Taveuni Islands, Qamea and Laucala Islands and the smaller Northern Lau islands. Mai Vunibua originally settled in Navosailagi (Speaker to the heaven) a fortified village (destroyed during the building of Laucala Resort) on Laucala Island. Mai Vunibua had seven sons (Mana'o tea-tea, Mai Sau-ana, Ta-bareva, Le'a, Lagi ni' Oro, Tu-i-Domoniwai and Dela-i-'Amou) \n\n [[File:Qaraniyaku - By Shelly Sayes - Cakaudrove Ideology and Reality in a Fijian Confederation.png|thumb]]\n'''The Yavusa - Vua-ni-cau.''' Mana'o tea-tea (Wainivava) people spread out to Northern Taveuni with a major settlement on Naselesele/Narova over Matei. Mana'o tea-tea was istalled 'Vunivalu' and led the people until his death. Ta-bareva (Qilo) remained on Southern Laucala Island and later Yanuca Island. Le'a (Cau-Leve) moved to Northern outer islands. Lagi ni'Oro (Lomanikoro) moved to Northern outer islands. Tu-i-Domoniwai (Nasau) settled on North and South (Vatu-ni- (sogosogo) Lagi - thrashing stone for rain) of Qamea Island.  Dela-i-'Amou (Delaiamou) settled on Qamea Island. \n\nVua'ta'i (descendant of Mai Sau-ana (Qara-ni-yau (yaku)[https://www.facebook.com/TogoVillageQameaIslandFiji/?rc=p]) was installed as Vunivalu after Mana'o tea-tea; the people (Qara-ni-yau (yaku)  remained in Laucala Island until the arrival of Waqanawanawa (originally known as Vua-ni-Sinu after returning from a visit to kin clan of Daunisai in Kabara).  Waqanawanawa accompanied by Mai-Naulusole and Mai-Nabuadugu of the Vuanisinu clan (Cakaudrove i Wai). \n\nEmpirical research by Shelly Sayes (Australian National University) in 1979, shed light to the history of the Laucala people originating from Mai Vunibua possibly Naulumatua. The research which collected 'story lines' from sub-chiefs from Cakaudrove, tells of possible parallel waves of migration from Verata by Naulumatua ( and others such as Waqanawanawa and brother Ului [who became Ului of Lakeba] ) to Vanua Levu, Northern Taveuni islands parts of Vanua Balavu and other islands - in waves over a period of many, many years depending on socio-economic and political structure stability and strength.  \n\nSayes collections of stories were confined to the Tuis and matanivanua's and elders (most if not all have passed on such as Tui Laucala and brother Josefa Velodroka whose versions were captured in Loloi and Naqara). The Qaraniyaku elders were not interviewed, hence Sayes confining observations or evidence from the Native Land Commission collections, missionary Journals, etc.  \n\n'''Dating of Occupation.''' Shelly Sayes (Australian National University) in 1979 suggests that archaeological evidence from information by Frost  (''E.L. Frost, 'Fiji' in J.D. Jennings (ed), The prehistory of Polynesia (Canberra 1979), 61-68'') points to the theory that Laucala may have been settled from as early as 16 BC to 6 BC based on archaeological evidence associated with makers of  ''La pita'' pottery \" ''which shows a continuous distribution from Melanesia to Western Polynesia--from as early as the sixteenth century BC to sixth century BC. Current linguistic theory argues that these people spoke an early Polynesian language. As La pita pottery has been found on southern Viti Levu as well as Vanua Levu, Laucala, and the Lau islands including Lakeba, it may be argued that, if there are not the settlers of the migration traditions, '''most areas had known settlement prior to the movement eastward'''''.\"   \n\nSome body of work by historians and researchers are flawed and challengable because studies fail to consider key fibres of sociology and common existence to link for instance La-Pita 'pottery' influence influence to economic growth.   \n\nSubsistence-based tribal settlers expanded to new territories when population expanded due to economic growth/development may have taken years. Also before European contact and reporting, the Fijians existed in small collective tribes and not confederacies of today (Colonial influence). We should note that tribal groups movement or travelling a body of land or even ocean in pre-historic era would have been a gargantuan feat. The primitive nature of engineering and developing tools, felling trees, and building canoes such as huge outriggers ( ''Drua'') to travel the immense body of Fiji waters, would take even a collective group of small  tribes generations to achieve. Fusing maritime navigational skills with canoe engineering would have made a formidable combination but taken years and years to integrate and master the skills - hence the stories of Naulumatua, Mai Vunibua and Waqanawanawa.  \n\n'''Movement Eastward''' - Laucala history has been closely associated with that of  Vuna ( traditional rivals) and Wainikeli's common 'theme in Waqanawanawa voyages\"; has been told in versions of folklore (from Vuna, Wainikeli, Laucala and Lakeba) with minor differences- that Waqanawanawa originated from Vuna, a centre of power (possibly due to the links to Moturiki's ''Ratu'') and slowly influenced Eastward to Lakeba and North to Laucala as well as Yacata.  \n\nFolklore suggests Moturiki was closely linked to  Lovoni (Roko-avono possibly Bui Savulu's nephew and Batitamata's (Laucala) kin?) and Bureta (Bui Savulu sister of Verata's Roko-Moutu, Batiki's Tui Nayavu and Kabara's Daunisai) who originated from the mainland Vitilevu (Verata and Nakauvadra). The period of these migrations and settlement  may have occurred in more than one wave over many years.  \n\n'''Pre-Deed of Session Laucala''' [[File:Laucala- boundary before the 1948 redistribution of fisheries boundaries.jpg|alt=Qaraniyaku, Laucala Cakaudrove|thumb|District of Laucala Northern Taviuni Boundary]]\nLaucala Island was leased by John Rosa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Rosa/6000000010316419817|title=John Rosa|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> and later Frederick George  Mitchell (who later settled on Invamay [Niubavu] (name given by claimant Edwin Turpin who was a Land Agent in Levuka ) who eventually sold the lease  to another leasee who eventually sold the lease for six shillings to  Mitchell) and Macomber brothers.

The Russian oven is usually placed in the centre of the [[izba]], a traditional Russian dwelling, and plays an immense role in the traditional [[Russian culture]] and way of life. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating and is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed. In winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm. As well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during the [[Great Patriotic War]] some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens. Porridge or pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in a traditional Russian oven can be called \"languor\" - holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature. Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian oven include [[baked milk]], [[pearl barley]], [[mushroom]]s cooked in [[Smetana (dairy product)|sour cream]], or even a simple potato.<ref>[http://n-t.ru/nj/nz/1988/0107.htm Russian oven in the 20th century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508213816/http://n-t.ru/nj/nz/1988/0107.htm |date=2009-05-08 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref>[http://pechka.su/ Russian oven] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913230300/http://www.pechka.su/ |date=2008-09-13 }} at pechka.su {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Rassolnik]]'''\n* '''Rassolnik''' is a Russian soup made from [[pickled cucumber]]s, [[pearl barley]] and pork or beef [[kidney]]s, though a vegetarian version also exists.

Vodka is one of the world's most popular liquors. It is made by [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[potato]]es, grapes, or [[sugar beet]] [[molasses]]. Alcoholic content usually ranges between 35 and 50 percent by [[volume]]. The standard Russian vodka is 40 percent alcohol by volume (80 [[ethanol|alcoholic proof|proof]]). The exact origins of vodka cannot be traced definitively, but almost certainly vodka as a beverage comes from 14th\u201315th-century [[Eastern Europe]]. Russia is often named the birthplace of vodka. The [[distillation apparatus]] was known in [[Moscow]] from the late 14th century and was used to produce [[Distilled beverage|spirit]], the precursor of vodka. According to Russian food historian [[William Pokhlyobkin]], the first original recipe of Russian vodka was produced around 1430 by a monk called [[Isidore (inventor)|Isidore]] from [[Chudov Monastery]] inside the [[Moscow Kremlin]].<ref name=\"pohlebkin_history\">{{cite book|author = [[Pokhlebkin|Pokhlebkin V.

Before that time [[tented roof]]s ([[cone (geometry)|conical]], or actually [[polygonal]] roofs) were made of wood and used in the wooden churches. These hipped roofs are thought to have originated in the Russian North, as they prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. Wooden tents also were used to cover [[tower]]s in [[kremlin]]s, or even applied in some common buildings, like it was in [[Western Europe]], but the thin, pointed, nearly conical roofs of the similar shape made of [[brick]] or [[stone]] became a unique form in Russian church architecture. Some scholars, however, argue that hipped roofs have something in common with European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[spire]]s, and even tend to call this style 'Russian Gothic'. The Ascension church of [[Kolomenskoye]], built in 1532 to commemorate the birth of the first Russian [[Tsar]] [[Ivan IV]], is often considered the first tented roof church, but recent studies show that the earliest use of the stone tented roof was in the Trinity Church in [[Alexandrov (town)|Alexandrov]], built in the 1510s.<ref>[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214934/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm |date=2013-01-16 }} by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n'''1530''' [[Russian architecture#Middle Muscovite period .281530.E2.80.931630.29|Middle Muscovite]]\n\n==Tsardom of Russia==\n\n===Late 16th century===\n[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abacus#Russian|Russian abacus]].]]\n'''[[Abacus#Russian|Russian abacus]]'''\n* The '''Russian abacus''' or '''schoty''' (literally \"counts\") is a [[decimal]] type of [[abacus]] that has a single slanted deck in a unique vertical layout, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four beads, for quarter-ruble fractions, that is usually near the user).

The unique feature of the Saint Basil's Cathedral is the fact that it is a complex of multiple temples put together. The original building, known as \"Trinity Cathedral\", contained eight side churches covered with [[onion dome]]s and arranged around the ninth, central [[tented roof]] church of [[Intercession of saints|Intercession]]; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local [[Foolishness for Christ|Fool]] [[Basil Fool for Christ|Vasily (Basil)]].

Granyonyi stakan has certain advantages over the other drinkware, since due to its form and hardness it is more difficult to break. It is arguably handier in usage on moving trains or rolling ships, where it is less prone to tip and fall, or slip from hands, and less likely to break upon hitting the floor. A legend says that the first known Russian faceted glass was given as a present to [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] from a glass-maker called [[Yefim Smolin]], living in [[Vladimir Oblast]]. He boasted to Tsar that his glass couldn't be broken. Tsar Peter liked the present, however, after drinking some alcoholic beverage from it, he threw the glass on the ground and managed to break it. Still Peter didn't punish the glass-maker, and the production of such glasses continued, while the Russian tradition of breaking [[drinkware]] on certain occasions originated from that episode.<ref>[http://hronograf.narod.ru/10/stakan.htm The Day of Granenyi Stakan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120181632/http://hronograf.narod.ru/10/stakan.htm |date=2010-11-20 }} at hronograf.narod.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rouble coins.png|left|thumb|Modern [[Russian ruble]]s and [[Ruble|kopecks]].]]\n'''1704 [[Decimal currency]]'''\n* The '''decimal currency''' is a type of [[currency]] that is based on one basic unit and a sub-unit which is a power of [[10 (number)|10]], typically 100.

Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''. This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the [[Cold War]].

This design greatly improves the maneuverability, alongside the [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] shape which helps resist the powerful winds up to 20 metre per second. The projet was started in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, with the first working prototype tested in 1991. That was rather small airship, and the giant thermoplan wasn't built at that time due to the problems caused by the economy crisis of the 1990s.

The Russian oven is usually placed in the centre of the [[izba]], a traditional Russian dwelling, and plays an immense role in the traditional [[Russian culture]] and way of life. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating and is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed. In winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm. As well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during the [[Great Patriotic War]] some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens. Porridge or pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in a traditional Russian oven can be called \"languor\" - holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature.

Before that time [[tented roof]]s ([[cone (geometry)|conical]], or actually [[polygonal]] roofs) were made of wood and used in the wooden churches. These hipped roofs are thought to have originated in the Russian North, as they prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. Wooden tents also were used to cover [[tower]]s in [[kremlin]]s, or even applied in some common buildings, like it was in [[Western Europe]], but the thin, pointed, nearly conical roofs of the similar shape made of [[brick]] or [[stone]] became a unique form in Russian church architecture. Some scholars, however, argue that hipped roofs have something in common with European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[spire]]s, and even tend to call this style 'Russian Gothic'. The Ascension church of [[Kolomenskoye]], built in 1532 to commemorate the birth of the first Russian [[Tsar]] [[Ivan IV]], is often considered the first tented roof church, but recent studies show that the earliest use of the stone tented roof was in the Trinity Church in [[Alexandrov (town)|Alexandrov]], built in the 1510s.<ref>[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214934/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm |date=2013-01-16 }} by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n'''1530''' [[Russian architecture#Middle Muscovite period .281530.E2.80.931630.29|Middle Muscovite]]\n\n==Tsardom of Russia==\n\n===Late 16th century===\n[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abacus#Russian|Russian abacus]].]]\n'''[[Abacus#Russian|Russian abacus]]'''\n* The '''Russian abacus''' or '''schoty''' (literally \"counts\") is a [[decimal]] type of [[abacus]] that has a single slanted deck in a unique vertical layout, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four beads, for quarter-ruble fractions, that is usually near the user).

The bell was commissioned by [[Empress Anna]], niece of [[Peter the Great]]. Currently it is the [[List of heaviest bells|largest and heaviest bell]] in the world, weighing 216 [[ton]]s, with a height of 6.14&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (20.1&nbsp;ft) and diameter of 6.6&nbsp;m (21.6&nbsp;ft). It was [[foundry|founded]] from [[bronze]] by masters [[Ivan Motorin]] and his son Mikhail in 1733\u20131735. The bell, however, was never rung because of a fire in 1737, when a huge slab (11.5 tons) cracked off while it was still in the casting pit. In 1836, the bell was placed on a stone [[pedestal]] next to the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]]. For a time, the bell served as a [[chapel]], with the broken area forming the door. According to the legend, on [[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]] the Tsar Bell will be miraculously repaired and lifted up to heaven, where it will ring the [[blagovest]] (call to prayer).<ref name=\"portnov\"/>\n\n[[File:Icehouse 1878.jpg|left|thumb|Inside the [[ice palace]] of Empress [[Anna of Russia]].]]\n'''1739 [[Ice palace]]'''\n\n===1740s===\n'''1741 [[Quick-firing gun]]'''\n[[File:3-\u0444\u0443\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (76-\u043c\u043c) 44-\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0410. \u041a. \u041d\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430.

Due to its unique history it was also called the ''World's Greatest Lost Treasure''. Several generations of German and Russian craftsmen worked on this masterpiece, prompted by several generations of monarchs. Construction began in 1701 to 1709 in [[Prussia]]. In 1716 the ''Amber Cabinet'' was given by Prussian king [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] to his then ally, [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia]]. Then it was expanded by Russian craftsmen, and by 1770, when the work was finished, the Room covered more than 55 square meters and contained over six tons of amber. It was [[looted art|looted]] during [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]], brought to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and lost in the chaos at the end of the war.

These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Chlorobium, Chromatium, Rhodomicrobium, and Beggiatoa, as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae.\n\n'''1888s [[Three-phase electric power]]'''\n* The three-phase system was developed independently from others by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]].\n\n'''1880 [[Vitamin]]s'''\n* By Nikolai Ivanovich Lunin ([[:ru:\u041b\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043d, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Russian Wikipedia article]])<ref>{{cite speech |last=Hopkins |first=Frederick Gowland |authorlink=Frederick Gowland Hopkins |title=The Earlier History of Vitamin Research |event=Nobel Prize Award Ceremony |date=11 December 1929 |location=Stockholm |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1929/hopkins-lecture.html |quote=It is now generally agreed that the first clear evidence, based upon experiment, for the existence of dietary factors of the nature of vitamins came from the school of Bunge at Basel. In 1881 Lunin, one of the workers in that school, fed mice upon an artificial mixture of the separate constituents of milk; of all the constituents, that is, which were then known, namely the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and salts. He found that upon such a mixture the animals failed to survive and was led to conclude that \"a natural food such as milk must therefore contain besides these known principal ingredients small quantities of unknown substances essential to life\". Such a statement, already half a century old, when allowed to stand out clear and apart from a context which tended to bury it, seems to contain the essentials of what is believed today. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610020638/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1929/hopkins-lecture.html |archivedate=10 June 2017 }}</ref>\n\n'''1880 [[Electric tram]]'''\n* by [[Fyodor Pirotsky]]\n\n'''1881 [[Carbon arc welding]]'''\n* The first arc welding method was introduced by [[Nikolay Benardos]] and later patented in 1887.<ref>[http://www.biografia.ru/cgi-bin/quotes.pl?oaction=show&name=benardos03 Biography of Nikolay Bernardos by A.

A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to [[Sumio Iijima]] of [[NEC]] in 1991. In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''. This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the [[Cold War]]. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.<ref name=\"carbon\">{{Cite journal|title=Who should be given the credit for the discovery of carbon nanotubes?|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.019|first=Marc|last=Monthioux|journal=Carbon|volume=44|issue=9|year=2006|url=http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf|page=1621|last2=Kuznetsov|first2=V|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818063155/http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf|archivedate=2006-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|first=\u041b. \u0412.|year=1952|script-title=ru:\u041e \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u0423\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0420\u0430\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u041e\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0423\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u041d\u0430 \u0416\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043c \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435|journal=\u0416\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0425\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0438|volume=26|pages=88\u201395|url=http://carbon.phys.msu.ru/publications/1952-radushkevich-lukyanovich.pdf|language=Russian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627183311/http://carbon.phys.msu.ru/publications/1952-radushkevich-lukyanovich.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-27}}</ref>\n\n'''1952 [[Anthropometric cosmetology]] or [[Ilizarov apparatus]]'''\n* by [[Gavril Ilizarov]]\n\n'''1954 [[Nuclear power plant]]'''\n* [[Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant]] by [[Igor Kurchatov]]\n\n'''1955 ''[[MiG-21]]'' '''\n* World's [[List of most produced aircraft|most produced supersonic aircraft]].\n\n'''1955 [[Ballistic missile submarine]]'''\n* [[R-11 Zemlya]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] by [[Victor Makeev]], [[Project 611]] [[ballistic missile submarine]]\n\n'''1955 [[Fast-neutron reactor]]'''\n* [[BN350]] nuclear fast reactor.\n\n'''1955 ''[[Leningrad Metro]]'' '''\n\n'''1955 [[Tokamak]]'''\n* The Tokamak T-4 was tested in 1968 in Novosibirsk, conducting the first ever quasistationary thermonuclear fusion reaction.

The projet was started in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, with the first working prototype tested in 1991. That was rather small airship, and the giant thermoplan wasn't built at that time due to the problems caused by the economy crisis of the 1990s. In the late 2000s (decade), the project was revived under the name ''Locomoskyner'' by the Russian company ''Locomosky'' in [[Ulyanovsk]].<ref>[http://www.locomosky.ru/en/ The official site of the ''Locomosky'' company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308235457/http://www.locomosky.ru/en/ |date=2010-03-08 }}\n</ref>\n\n'''1991 [[Scramjet]]\n* The [[Central Institute of Aviation Motors|Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM)]] KHOLOD Hypersonic Flying Laboratory.
