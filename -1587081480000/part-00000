It is on the north bank of the [[River Tees]] and for ceremonial purposes is in [[County Durham]]. The bridge at Eaglescliffe on the border with [[Yarm]] marked the last crossing point of tidal section of the River Tees until a five-arch stone toll bridge was built in 1771 in Stockton on Tees. This bridge was replaced in 1887 by the Victoria Bridge, now a grade ll listed building. The opening of the [[Tees Barrage]] in [[Stockton on Tees|Stockton]] in 1995 made the section of the Tees through Eaglescliffe non-tidal. Eaglescliffe is divided by railway lines which lead from Yarm to Stockton and can only be crossed by vehicles at the north and south of the town, although there are two pedestrian bridges and an underpass.\n\n==History==\nThe name of the town is thought to be derived from a misspelling of the name of the nearby village of [[Egglescliffe]] meaning a church on a hill. A common myth on the name change is that in Victorian times the sign for the new railway station turned up incorrect after the signwriter thought that [[Egglescliffe]] was a mistake and altered it.\n\nBishop Skirlaw of Durham built a stone bridge across the Tees in 1400 which still stands. An iron replacement was built in 1805, but it fell down in 1806.\n\nThe [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] passed through the grounds of [[Preston Hall, Preston-on-Tees|Preston Hall]] in Eaglescliffe, and on the opening day there was a famous race between a [[stagecoach]] travelling down Yarm Road, and the [[Locomotion No. 1]].\n\nIn 2011, Eaglescliffe was named the 4th best place for families to live in England and [[Wales]], according to the savings firm Family Investments.\n\n===Allens West===\nFrom the 1940s to the 1990s there was an MOD base situated at Allens West in Eaglescliffe. After [[World War II]] the base was Metal Reclamation Unit No 2, and was used to dismantle aircraft that were downed in the north of England.\n\nIt then became the Royal Navy Spare Parts Distribution Centre (RNSPDC), and later the Royal Navy Supply Depot (RNSD) Eaglescliffe, until its closure in January 1997 as part of the 'Defence Cost Study'. The storage and distribution functions were transferred to [[Portsmouth Naval Base]], and the procurement function to MOD's site at [[MoD Abbey Wood|Abbey Wood]], Bristol.\n\nAt its height, the Depot employed more than 2,000 staff and had a significant influence on the local economy. This later reduced to around 750 just prior to closure in 1997.\n\nPart of the former MOD site is now the [[Urlay Nook]] Admiralty ecology park, the rest of the site was sold to a Distribution company in 1997.\n\nAerial photographs show that the site used to have railway sidings and a small runway.\n\nA masterplan has been drawn up to build up to 1000 homes, a 5000m{{sup|2}} care home, 500m{{sup|2}} of community facilities, and up to 1000m{{sup|2}} of retail space on the site.<ref>http://www.planningwam.stockton.gov.uk/WAM133/doc/Drawing-1523310.pdf?extension=.pdf&id=1523310&location=VOLUME1&contentType=application/pdf&pageCount=1{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Eaglescliffe plan.png|thumb|150px|A map of Eaglescliffe showing main roads and estates.]]\nEaglescliffe adjoins a small village called [[Egglescliffe]], and legend says that the name Eaglescliffe came about when a mistake was made on the railway station's sign. The village lies in the civil parish of Egglescliffe, as does [[Urlay Nook]], to the west. The north part of Eaglescliffe, to the west of the A135, lies within the parish of [[Preston-on-Tees]]. Several housing estates combine to form Eaglescliffe including Millfield, Kingsmead, Sunningdale, Hunters Green and Orchard Estate.\n\nThe main road through the town is the [[A135 road|A135]] ''Yarm Road'' which was part of the old route of the [[A19 road|A19]] until the 1970s when it was diverted near [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] to the east. Nearby towns include Stockton-On-Tees and [[Middlesbrough]] to the north and north-east and [[Darlington]] to the west.\n\n== Events ==\nMany events are held in Eaglescliffe every year, mostly in [[Preston Park, Stockton-on-Tees|Preston Park]] which is situated to the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/567830 north] of the town on the Tees. Many of these events are run by Stockton Council.\n[[File:Archery Display , Preston Park - geograph.org.uk - 227040.jpg|thumb|One of the events at Preston Park]]\n[[File:Preston Hall, Eaglescliffe.jpg|thumb|Preston Hall museum in Eaglescliffe.]]\n\nMany local groups gather at the community centres and village halls within Eaglescliffe and its neighbouring village, Egglescliffe. '''Egglescliffe Community Centre''' is the largest, and plays host to two amateur dramatics groups \u2013 '''Cliffe Theatre''' (who produce at least two plays every year), and '''Centre Stage''' (who produce a pantomime every January, as well as a musical every summer). Egglescliffe Community Centre also hosts many other community groups including a Ladies Section, a weight loss group, dance classes, and many others.\n\n== Sport and leisure ==\nWithin Eaglescliffe, sited on ''Yarm Road'', is Eaglescliffe Golf Club \u2013 a course which occupies the land on the eastern side of Eaglescliffe bordered to the south by the Sunningdale Estate, to the north by Teesside High School, and to the east by the River Tees. Many street names in the Sunningdale Estate, as well as the name of the local 'Links Primary School', reflect the location of this golf club. Preston Park is where families go for both sport and leisure.\n[[File:Looking across arable land towards the trees of Eaglescliffe golf course - geograph.org.uk - 488843.jpg|thumb|Fields near the Golf course, by the River Tees]]\n\n==Education==\nEaglescliffe has one secondary school called [[Egglescliffe School]]. This is in the east of the town and also has Egglescliffe Sixth Form College for ages 16-18. There are also four primary schools: Junction Farm, Durham Lane, The Links, and Preston. Egglescliffe village has a primary school called Egglescliffe CofE Primary School. As well as these there is also [[Teesside High School]], an independent preparatory and high school, originally an all-girls [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/483954 school], it is now introducing boys within the framework of a diamond model of education.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Tetley Tea]] have had their only tea bag factory in the western world here since 1969 on ''Sowerby Way''. It is the largest tea bag factory in the world, on the Durham Lane Industrial Park, having a floor area of {{convert|220000|sqft|m2}} and makes 18 billion tea bags a year; [[David Cameron]] and [[Boris Johnson]] have both visited the site [[Warburtons]] have a bakery outside of the village to the north-east on the Preston Farm Industrial Estate. The [[Elementis|Elementis Chromium]] site in nearby [[Urlay Nook]] closed in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/8025746.stm|title=Jobs hit as chemical plant closes |date=29 April 2009|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Footpaths meet by the River Tees - geograph.org.uk - 488820.jpg|thumb|A popular walk is between Eaglescliffe Golf Course and [[Yarm]]]]\nEaglescliffe is part of the [[Stockton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockton South Parliamentary Constituency]] which is currently represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by [[Matt Vickers]] (Conservative) who won the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] by a majority of 5,260.

The village lies in the civil parish of Egglescliffe, as does [[Urlay Nook]], to the west. The north part of Eaglescliffe, to the west of the A135, lies within the parish of [[Preston-on-Tees]]. Several housing estates combine to form Eaglescliffe including Millfield, Kingsmead, Sunningdale, Hunters Green and Orchard Estate.\n\nThe main road through the town is the [[A135 road|A135]] ''Yarm Road'' which was part of the old route of the [[A19 road|A19]] until the 1970s when it was diverted near [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] to the east. Nearby towns include Stockton-On-Tees and [[Middlesbrough]] to the north and north-east and [[Darlington]] to the west.\n\n== Events ==\nMany events are held in Eaglescliffe every year, mostly in [[Preston Park, Stockton-on-Tees|Preston Park]] which is situated to the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/567830 north] of the town on the Tees. Many of these events are run by Stockton Council.\n[[File:Archery Display , Preston Park - geograph.org.uk - 227040.jpg|thumb|One of the events at Preston Park]]\n[[File:Preston Hall, Eaglescliffe.jpg|thumb|Preston Hall museum in Eaglescliffe.]]\n\nMany local groups gather at the community centres and village halls within Eaglescliffe and its neighbouring village, Egglescliffe. '''Egglescliffe Community Centre''' is the largest, and plays host to two amateur dramatics groups \u2013 '''Cliffe Theatre''' (who produce at least two plays every year), and '''Centre Stage''' (who produce a pantomime every January, as well as a musical every summer). Egglescliffe Community Centre also hosts many other community groups including a Ladies Section, a weight loss group, dance classes, and many others.\n\n== Sport and leisure ==\nWithin Eaglescliffe, sited on ''Yarm Road'', is Eaglescliffe Golf Club \u2013 a course which occupies the land on the eastern side of Eaglescliffe bordered to the south by the Sunningdale Estate, to the north by Teesside High School, and to the east by the River Tees. Many street names in the Sunningdale Estate, as well as the name of the local 'Links Primary School', reflect the location of this golf club. Preston Park is where families go for both sport and leisure.\n[[File:Looking across arable land towards the trees of Eaglescliffe golf course - geograph.org.uk - 488843.jpg|thumb|Fields near the Golf course, by the River Tees]]\n\n==Education==\nEaglescliffe has one secondary school called [[Egglescliffe School]]. This is in the east of the town and also has Egglescliffe Sixth Form College for ages 16-18. There are also four primary schools: Junction Farm, Durham Lane, The Links, and Preston. Egglescliffe village has a primary school called Egglescliffe CofE Primary School. As well as these there is also [[Teesside High School]], an independent preparatory and high school, originally an all-girls [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/483954 school], it is now introducing boys within the framework of a diamond model of education.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Tetley Tea]] have had their only tea bag factory in the western world here since 1969 on ''Sowerby Way''.

He then told Vickie that he wanted a divorce, leading to her suffering from a nervous breakdown.

On the special December 8 episode of ''Raw'', Vickie and Edge won a [[Slammy Award]] for the [[2008 Slammy Awards|Couple of the Year]].\n\nOn February 23, 2009, she was appointed the interim General Manager of ''Raw'' during [[Stephanie McMahon]]'s absence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/sdspecial/vickienude/|title=Vickie nude|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=February 22, 2009}}</ref> On the following ''Raw'', Guerrero announced that Edge would be facing Big Show for his World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania XXV]].

At WrestleMania XXV, Edge lost the World Heavyweight title to Cena after Cena pinned Show after Cena delivered the Attitude Adjustment to Edge onto the Big Show.

After her announcement, Edge came out and told Vickie that he was sorry for saying disrespectful things about her, only to reveal that he only married her so she could help him in World Championship matches, and now that she quit, she was useless to him in his endeavors to become the champion again. He then told Vickie that he wanted a divorce, leading to her suffering from a nervous breakdown.

The second part of the season is opened with a massive score against Lucchese; on round 22 Juventus grabbed the club, then Inter retake the advantage by 2 points next sunday. The team took the distance of 3 points on round 26, after the match against [[Associazione Calcio Liguria|Liguria]]. Following the result of Inter, Juventus lost its game against [[Trieste]] and not won the game of Liguria. So, Ambrosiana remained over top in the last round with 39 points, followed by Juventus with 38 and Bologna. The squad clinched the title on final round, winning the match of [[Bari]]. \n\nWhen Ambrosiana beat Bari, Meazza scored five goals in a 9\u20132 victory. The next week he scored a hat-trick against Lucchese.

Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled, since the door was not occupying usable interior space when open. To secure the door against the outward force from the [[pressurization]] of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.<ref name=waddington_p85-6>Waddington 2000, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\n====American Airlines Flight 96====\n{{main|American Airlines Flight 96}}\nA problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when [[American Airlines Flight 96]] lost its [[aft]] cargo door shortly after takeoff from [[Detroit Metro Airport]], in flight above [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut. Due to the cargo door's design, the door appeared to be securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately {{convert|11750|ft|m}} in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.<ref name=aci>\"Behind Closed Doors\". ''Air Crash Investigation, Mayday (TV series)''. [[National Geographic Channel]], Season 5, Number 2.</ref> This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the [[empennage]] control systems necessary to fly the aircraft, which were routed through the floor beams, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.<ref name=fielder_birsch_p94/><ref name=fielder_birsch_p94>Fielder and Birsch 1992, p. 94.</ref><ref>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR73-02.pdf \"NTSB-AAR-73-02 Report, Aircraft Accident Report: American Airlines, Inc.

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

The loss of hydraulic pressure to the [[leading edge slat]] actuators caused the slats to retract due to [[aerodynamic force]]s, increasing the left wing's stall speed above the engine failure [[climb out]] speed being used by the pilots.  With the left wing stalled and further destabilized by [[asymmetric thrust]], the DC-10 rapidly rolled to the left, sharply descended, and crashed, killing all 271 people on board and two individuals on the ground.<ref name=Endres_p62>Endres 1998, p. 62.</ref> The loss of Flight 191 remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history.

American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon, then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a [[forklift]], which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it.<ref name=AAR79-17>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR79-17.pdf \"Aircraft Accident report, DC-10-10, N110A, NTSB, 1979\"].

The panel's report, published in June 1980, found \"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\". This conclusion was echoed nearly 40 years later in the inquiries into the [[Boeing 737 MAX groundings|2019 grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theaircurrent.com/historical-context/searching-for-40-year-old-lessons-for-boeing-in-the-grounding-of-the-dc-10/|title=Searching for 40-year old lessons for Boeing in the grounding of the DC-10|date=2019-10-15|website=The Air Current|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>{{vs|date=November 2019}}\n\n====United Airlines Flight 232====\nAnother major DC-10 crash was the [[United Airlines Flight 232]] crash at [[Sioux City, Iowa]], on July 19, 1989. The number two (tail) engine suffered an uncontained fan disk failure in flight, which damaged all three hydraulic systems and rendered the hydraulic flight controls inoperable. The flight crew, led by Captain [[Alfred C. Haynes|Al Haynes]] and assisted by DC-10 flight instructor [[Deadheading (aviation)|flying as a passenger]] ([[Dennis E. Fitch|Dennis E. \"Denny\" Fitch]]), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines. The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived (111 died) despite the destruction of the aircraft during the crash landing.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06/>\n\nThe DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic-powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and that the control surfaces were too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}.

It is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems elsewhere. This nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main-gear tire exploded in the wheel well. The damage in the left wing area caused total loss of pressure from the #1 and the #2 hydraulic systems.

The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane.

Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground.

The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].

Spater, President of American Airlines, and James S. McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas announced American Airlines' intention to acquire the DC-10. This was a shock to Lockheed and there was general agreement within the U.S. aviation industry that American Airlines had left its competitors at the starting gate.

The vertical stabilizer with its two-segment rudder, is mounted on top of the tail engine banjo. The [[tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]] with its four-segment elevator is attached to the sides of the rear fuselage in the conventional manner. The airliner has a retractable tricycle landing gear. To enable higher gross weights, the later -30 and -40 series have an additional two-wheel main landing gear, which retracts into the center of the fuselage.<ref>Endres 1998, pp. 36\u201337, 45.</ref>\n\nIt was designed for medium to long-range flights that can accommodate 250 to 380 passengers, and is operated by a cockpit flight crew of three.

Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled, since the door was not occupying usable interior space when open. To secure the door against the outward force from the [[pressurization]] of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.<ref name=waddington_p85-6>Waddington 2000, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\n====American Airlines Flight 96====\n{{main|American Airlines Flight 96}}\nA problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when [[American Airlines Flight 96]] lost its [[aft]] cargo door shortly after takeoff from [[Detroit Metro Airport]], in flight above [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut. Due to the cargo door's design, the door appeared to be securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately {{convert|11750|ft|m}} in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.<ref name=aci>\"Behind Closed Doors\". ''Air Crash Investigation, Mayday (TV series)''. [[National Geographic Channel]], Season 5, Number 2.</ref> This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the [[empennage]] control systems necessary to fly the aircraft, which were routed through the floor beams, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.<ref name=fielder_birsch_p94/><ref name=fielder_birsch_p94>Fielder and Birsch 1992, p. 94.</ref><ref>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR73-02.pdf \"NTSB-AAR-73-02 Report, Aircraft Accident Report: American Airlines, Inc.

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

The loss of hydraulic pressure to the [[leading edge slat]] actuators caused the slats to retract due to [[aerodynamic force]]s, increasing the left wing's stall speed above the engine failure [[climb out]] speed being used by the pilots.  With the left wing stalled and further destabilized by [[asymmetric thrust]], the DC-10 rapidly rolled to the left, sharply descended, and crashed, killing all 271 people on board and two individuals on the ground.<ref name=Endres_p62>Endres 1998, p. 62.</ref> The loss of Flight 191 remains the deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history. The crash and its aftermath were widely covered by the media and dealt a severe blow to the DC-10's reputation and sales.\n\nFollowing the crash, the FAA withdrew the DC-10's [[type certificate]] on June 6, 1979, which grounded all U.S. DC-10s. It grounded 138 U.S.-registered DC-10s, along with DC-10s from other nations with bilateral agreements with the United States, regarding aircraft certifications, and banned all other DC-10s from U.S. airspace.

American Airlines mechanics had removed the engine and its pylon as a unit, rather than removing the engine from the pylon, then removing the pylon from the wing, as recommended by McDonnell Douglas. The faulty procedure was done using a [[forklift]], which resulted in inadvertent structural damage. It was subsequently discovered that this short-cut procedure, believed to save many man-hours on maintenance, was being used by three major airlines, although McDonnell Douglas had advised against it.<ref name=AAR79-17>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR79-17.pdf \"Aircraft Accident report, DC-10-10, N110A, NTSB, 1979\"].

The panel's report, published in June 1980, found \"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\". This conclusion was echoed nearly 40 years later in the inquiries into the [[Boeing 737 MAX groundings|2019 grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theaircurrent.com/historical-context/searching-for-40-year-old-lessons-for-boeing-in-the-grounding-of-the-dc-10/|title=Searching for 40-year old lessons for Boeing in the grounding of the DC-10|date=2019-10-15|website=The Air Current|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>{{vs|date=November 2019}}\n\n====United Airlines Flight 232====\nAnother major DC-10 crash was the [[United Airlines Flight 232]] crash at [[Sioux City, Iowa]], on July 19, 1989. The number two (tail) engine suffered an uncontained fan disk failure in flight, which damaged all three hydraulic systems and rendered the hydraulic flight controls inoperable. The flight crew, led by Captain [[Alfred C. Haynes|Al Haynes]] and assisted by DC-10 flight instructor [[Deadheading (aviation)|flying as a passenger]] ([[Dennis E. Fitch|Dennis E. \"Denny\" Fitch]]), performed an emergency landing by constantly adjusting the thrust of the remaining two engines. The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived (111 died) despite the destruction of the aircraft during the crash landing.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06/>\n\nThe DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic-powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and that the control surfaces were too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}.

It is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems elsewhere. This nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main-gear tire exploded in the wheel well. The damage in the left wing area caused total loss of pressure from the #1 and the #2 hydraulic systems.

This is the first hull loss of a DC-10 aircraft.\n* November 12, 1975: [[Overseas National Airways|ONA]] Flight 032, a DC-10 on a ferry flight struck a heavy flock of seagulls while on its takeoff roll from JFK International Airport, New York. The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane.

All passengers survived.<ref>NTSB report, Identification: DCA76RA017</ref>{{specify|This cite needs filling out|date=March 2014}} \n* March 1, 1978: [[Continental Airlines Flight 603]], a DC-10-10, began its take-off from Los Angeles International Airport. Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground.

The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].
