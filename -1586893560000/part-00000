He acknowledges that those who criticize the extent of this power only question the President's ability to convene each branch separately.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hamilton argues that since the Executive branch has \"concurrent power\" with the Senate, and only the Senate, to form treaties that it would be \"unnecessary and improper\" to convene the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as well.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1473276 Jeremy D.

Like other [[arbovirus]]es, which are transmitted by mosquitoes, ''yellow fever virus'' is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or another primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect [[epithelial cell]]s and replicate there. From there, they reach the [[haemocoel]] (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the [[salivary gland]]s. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten person. [[Transovarial transmission|Transovarial]] and [[transstadial transmission]] of yellow fever virus within ''A. aegypti'', that is, the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae, are indicated.

It is well adapted to urban areas, and can also transmit other diseases, including [[Zika fever]], [[dengue fever]], and [[chikungunya]]. The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except for an outbreak in Bolivia in 1999, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America.\n\nBesides the urban cycle, both in Africa and South America, a [[sylvatic cycle]] (forest or jungle cycle) is present, where ''[[Aedes africanus]]'' (in Africa) or mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Haemagogus]]'' and ''[[Sabethes]]'' (in South America) serve as vectors. In the jungle, the mosquitoes infect mainly nonhuman primates; the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates. In South America, the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can become infected, which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on the continent. People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban areas, where ''A. aegypti'' acts as a vector. Because of this sylvatic cycle, yellow fever cannot be eradicated except by eradicating the mosquitoes that serve as vectors.<ref name=Barr2007/>\n\nIn Africa, a third infectious cycle known as \"savannah cycle\" or intermediate cycle, occurs between the jungle and urban cycles. Different mosquitoes of the genus ''Aedes'' are involved.

Mild courses of the disease can only be confirmed virologically. Since mild courses of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks, every suspected case of yellow fever (involving symptoms of fever, pain, nausea, and vomiting 6\u201310 days after leaving the affected area) is treated seriously.\n\nIf yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until 6\u201310 days after the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]], where the genome of the virus is amplified.<ref name=Toll2009/> Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using [[blood plasma]]; this can take 1\u20134 weeks.\n\nSerologically, an [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] during the acute phase of the disease using specific [[IgM]] against yellow fever or an increase in specific [[IgG]] [[titer]] (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a four-fold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. Since these tests can cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as [[dengue virus]], these indirect methods cannot conclusively prove yellow fever infection.\n\nLiver [[biopsy]] can verify [[inflammation]] and [[necrosis]] of hepatocytes and detect viral [[antigen]]s. Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients, a biopsy is only advisable ''post mortem'' to confirm the cause of death.\n\nIn a [[differential diagnosis]], infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as [[malaria]]. Other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, such as [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Junin virus]], must be excluded as the cause.\n\n==Prevention==\nPersonal prevention of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites in areas where yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. EPA-registered insecticide spray decreases the transmission of yellow fever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|title=Prevention {{!}} Yellow Fever {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026165250/http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|archivedate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\n* Use insect repellent when outdoors such as those containing [[DEET]], [[picaridin]], [[ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate]] (IR3535), or [[oil of lemon eucalyptus]] on exposed skin.\n* Wear proper clothing to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing [[permethrin]] or another EPA-registered repellent gives extra protection. Clothing treated with permethrin is commercially available. Mosquito repellents containing permethrin are not approved for application directly to the skin.\n* The peak biting times for many mosquito species are dusk to dawn. However, ''A. aegypti'', one of the mosquitoes that transmits yellow fever virus, feeds during the daytime. Staying in accommodations with screened or air-conditioned rooms, particularly during peak biting times, also reduces the risk of mosquito bites.\n\n===Vaccination===\n[[File:Yellow fever certificate.JPG|thumb|The [[Carte Jaune|cover of a certificate]] that confirms the holder has been vaccinated against yellow fever]]\n{{Main|Yellow fever vaccine}}\n[[Vaccination]] is recommended for those traveling to affected areas, because non-native people tend to develop more severe illness when infected.

To prevent introduction of the virus, some countries demand previous vaccination of foreign visitors if they have passed through yellow fever areas. Vaccination has to be proved by the production of a vaccination certificate, which is valid 10 days after the vaccination and lasts for 10 years. Although the WHO on 17 May 2013 advised that subsequent booster vaccinations are unnecessary, an older (than 10 years) certificate may not be acceptable at all border posts in all affected countries.  A list of the countries that require yellow fever vaccination is published by the WHO.<ref name=\"urlwww.who.int\">{{cite web |url         = http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_country_list.pdf |title       = Country list: Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations; malaria situation; and other vaccination requirements |year        = 2013 |publisher   = WHO |page        = 32 |accessdate  = 2015-04-12 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405160357/http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_country_list.pdf |archivedate = 2015-04-05 }}</ref> If the vaccination cannot be conducted for some reasons, dispensation may be possible. In this case, an exemption certificate issued by a WHO-approved vaccination center is required. Although 32 of 44 countries where yellow fever occurs endemically do have vaccination programmes, in many of these countries, less than 50% of their population is vaccinated.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n===Vector control===\n[[File:Luchemos todos contra el dengue.jpg|thumb|left|Information campaign for prevention of [[dengue]] and yellow fever in [[Paraguay]]]]\nControl of the yellow fever mosquito ''A. aegypti'' is of major importance, especially because the same mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and chikungunya disease. ''A. aegypti'' breeds preferentially in water, for example in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supply, or in domestic waste, especially tires, cans, and plastic bottles. These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries.\n\nTwo main strategies are employed to reduce mosquito populations. One approach is to kill the developing larvae. Measures are taken to reduce the water accumulations in which the larvae develop. [[Larvicide]]s are used, as well as larvae-eating fish and [[copepod]]s, which reduce the number of larvae. For many years, copepods of the genus ''[[Mesocyclops]]'' have been used in [[Vietnam]] for preventing dengue fever. It eradicated the mosquito vector in several areas. Similar efforts may be effective against yellow fever. [[Pyriproxyfen]] is recommended as a chemical larvicide, mainly because it is safe for humans and effective even in small doses.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\nThe second strategy is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito. [[Lethal ovitrap]]s can reduce ''Aedes'' populations, but with a decreased amount of pesticide because it targets the mosquitoes directly. Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s are effective, just as they are against the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito that carries malaria.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n==Treatment==\nAs for other ''Flavivirus'' infections, no cure is known for yellow fever. Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. Different methods for acute treatment of the disease have been shown not to be very successful; passive immunization after the emergence of symptoms is probably without effect. [[Ribavirin]] and other [[antiviral drug]]s, as well as treatment with [[interferon]]s, do not have a positive effect in patients.<ref name=\"pmid18061688\"/> Asymptomatic treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with drugs such as [[paracetamol]]. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating in the case of internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.{{according to|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nYellow fever is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|common]] in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Worldwide, about 600 million people live in endemic areas. The WHO estimates 200,000 cases of disease and 30,000 deaths a year occur. But the number of officially reported cases is far lower.\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Yellow fever Africa 2009.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|Areas with risk of yellow fever in Africa (2017)]]\nAn estimated 90% of the infections occur on the African continent.<ref name=Toll2009/> In 2008, the largest number of recorded cases was in [[Togo]].

Beginning in 1903, the campaign led by [[Oswaldo Cruz]], then director general of public health, resulted not only in eradicating the disease but also in reshaping the physical landscape of Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro. During rainy seasons, Rio de Janeiro had regularly suffered floods, as water from the bay surrounding the city overflowed into Rio's narrow streets. Coupled with the poor drainage systems found throughout Rio, this created swampy conditions in the city's neighborhoods. Pools of stagnant water stood year-long in city streets and proved to be a fertile ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Thus, under Cruz's direction, public health units known as \"mosquito inspectors\" fiercely worked to combat yellow fever throughout Rio by spraying, exterminating rats, improving drainage, and destroying unsanitary housing. Ultimately, the city's sanitation and renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods. Its poor residents were pushed from city centers to Rio's suburbs, or to towns found in the outskirts of the city. In later years, Rio's most impoverished inhabitants would come to reside in ''favelas''.<ref>Teresa A. Meade, ''A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 To The Present, 1st ed.''

Since 1943, only a single urban outbreak in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]], has occurred. Since the 1980s, however, the number of yellow fever cases has been increasing again, and ''A. aegypti'' has returned to the urban centers of South America. This is partly due to limitations on available insecticides, as well as habitat dislocations caused by climate change. It is also because the vector control program was abandoned. Although no new urban cycle has yet been established, scientists believe this could happen again at any point. An outbreak in [[Paraguay]] in 2008 was thought to be urban in nature, but this ultimately proved not to be the case.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\nIn Africa, virus eradication programs have mostly relied upon vaccination. These programs have largely been unsuccessful because they were unable to break the sylvatic cycle involving wild primates.

Like other [[arbovirus]]es, which are transmitted by mosquitoes, ''yellow fever virus'' is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or another primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect [[epithelial cell]]s and replicate there. From there, they reach the [[haemocoel]] (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the [[salivary gland]]s. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten person. [[Transovarial transmission|Transovarial]] and [[transstadial transmission]] of yellow fever virus within ''A. aegypti'', that is, the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae, are indicated. This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems to play a role in single, sudden breakouts of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Fontenille D, Diallo M, Mondo M, Ndiaye M, Thonnon J | title = First evidence of natural vertical transmission of yellow fever virus in ''Aedes aegypti'', its epidemic vector | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 533\u20135 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9463659 | doi = 10.1016/S0035-9203(97)90013-4 }}</ref>\n\nThree epidemiologically different infectious cycles occur<ref name=Barr2007/> in which the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans or other primates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infectious Diseases Related to Travel|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever|website=Yellow Book|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=20 March 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320215700/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref> In the \"urban cycle\", only the yellow fever mosquito ''A. aegypti'' is involved. It is well adapted to urban areas, and can also transmit other diseases, including [[Zika fever]], [[dengue fever]], and [[chikungunya]]. The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except for an outbreak in Bolivia in 1999, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America.\n\nBesides the urban cycle, both in Africa and South America, a [[sylvatic cycle]] (forest or jungle cycle) is present, where ''[[Aedes africanus]]'' (in Africa) or mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Haemagogus]]'' and ''[[Sabethes]]'' (in South America) serve as vectors. In the jungle, the mosquitoes infect mainly nonhuman primates; the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates. In South America, the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can become infected, which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on the continent. People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban areas, where ''A. aegypti'' acts as a vector. Because of this sylvatic cycle, yellow fever cannot be eradicated except by eradicating the mosquitoes that serve as vectors.<ref name=Barr2007/>\n\nIn Africa, a third infectious cycle known as \"savannah cycle\" or intermediate cycle, occurs between the jungle and urban cycles. Different mosquitoes of the genus ''Aedes'' are involved.

Mild courses of the disease can only be confirmed virologically. Since mild courses of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks, every suspected case of yellow fever (involving symptoms of fever, pain, nausea, and vomiting 6\u201310 days after leaving the affected area) is treated seriously.\n\nIf yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until 6\u201310 days after the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]], where the genome of the virus is amplified.<ref name=Toll2009/> Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using [[blood plasma]]; this can take 1\u20134 weeks.\n\nSerologically, an [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] during the acute phase of the disease using specific [[IgM]] against yellow fever or an increase in specific [[IgG]] [[titer]] (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a four-fold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. Since these tests can cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as [[dengue virus]], these indirect methods cannot conclusively prove yellow fever infection.\n\nLiver [[biopsy]] can verify [[inflammation]] and [[necrosis]] of hepatocytes and detect viral [[antigen]]s. Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients, a biopsy is only advisable ''post mortem'' to confirm the cause of death.\n\nIn a [[differential diagnosis]], infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as [[malaria]]. Other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, such as [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Junin virus]], must be excluded as the cause.\n\n==Prevention==\nPersonal prevention of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites in areas where yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. EPA-registered insecticide spray decreases the transmission of yellow fever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|title=Prevention {{!}} Yellow Fever {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026165250/http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|archivedate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\n* Use insect repellent when outdoors such as those containing [[DEET]], [[picaridin]], [[ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate]] (IR3535), or [[oil of lemon eucalyptus]] on exposed skin.\n* Wear proper clothing to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing [[permethrin]] or another EPA-registered repellent gives extra protection. Clothing treated with permethrin is commercially available. Mosquito repellents containing permethrin are not approved for application directly to the skin.\n* The peak biting times for many mosquito species are dusk to dawn. However, ''A. aegypti'', one of the mosquitoes that transmits yellow fever virus, feeds during the daytime. Staying in accommodations with screened or air-conditioned rooms, particularly during peak biting times, also reduces the risk of mosquito bites.\n\n===Vaccination===\n[[File:Yellow fever certificate.JPG|thumb|The [[Carte Jaune|cover of a certificate]] that confirms the holder has been vaccinated against yellow fever]]\n{{Main|Yellow fever vaccine}}\n[[Vaccination]] is recommended for those traveling to affected areas, because non-native people tend to develop more severe illness when infected.

To prevent introduction of the virus, some countries demand previous vaccination of foreign visitors if they have passed through yellow fever areas. Vaccination has to be proved by the production of a vaccination certificate, which is valid 10 days after the vaccination and lasts for 10 years. Although the WHO on 17 May 2013 advised that subsequent booster vaccinations are unnecessary, an older (than 10 years) certificate may not be acceptable at all border posts in all affected countries.  A list of the countries that require yellow fever vaccination is published by the WHO.<ref name=\"urlwww.who.int\">{{cite web |url         = http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_country_list.pdf |title       = Country list: Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations; malaria situation; and other vaccination requirements |year        = 2013 |publisher   = WHO |page        = 32 |accessdate  = 2015-04-12 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405160357/http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_country_list.pdf |archivedate = 2015-04-05 }}</ref> If the vaccination cannot be conducted for some reasons, dispensation may be possible. In this case, an exemption certificate issued by a WHO-approved vaccination center is required. Although 32 of 44 countries where yellow fever occurs endemically do have vaccination programmes, in many of these countries, less than 50% of their population is vaccinated.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n===Vector control===\n[[File:Luchemos todos contra el dengue.jpg|thumb|left|Information campaign for prevention of [[dengue]] and yellow fever in [[Paraguay]]]]\nControl of the yellow fever mosquito ''A. aegypti'' is of major importance, especially because the same mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and chikungunya disease. ''A. aegypti'' breeds preferentially in water, for example in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supply, or in domestic waste, especially tires, cans, and plastic bottles. These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries.\n\nTwo main strategies are employed to reduce mosquito populations. One approach is to kill the developing larvae. Measures are taken to reduce the water accumulations in which the larvae develop. [[Larvicide]]s are used, as well as larvae-eating fish and [[copepod]]s, which reduce the number of larvae. For many years, copepods of the genus ''[[Mesocyclops]]'' have been used in [[Vietnam]] for preventing dengue fever. It eradicated the mosquito vector in several areas. Similar efforts may be effective against yellow fever. [[Pyriproxyfen]] is recommended as a chemical larvicide, mainly because it is safe for humans and effective even in small doses.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\nThe second strategy is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito. [[Lethal ovitrap]]s can reduce ''Aedes'' populations, but with a decreased amount of pesticide because it targets the mosquitoes directly. Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s are effective, just as they are against the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito that carries malaria.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n==Treatment==\nAs for other ''Flavivirus'' infections, no cure is known for yellow fever. Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. Different methods for acute treatment of the disease have been shown not to be very successful; passive immunization after the emergence of symptoms is probably without effect. [[Ribavirin]] and other [[antiviral drug]]s, as well as treatment with [[interferon]]s, do not have a positive effect in patients.<ref name=\"pmid18061688\"/> Asymptomatic treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with drugs such as [[paracetamol]]. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating in the case of internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.{{according to|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nYellow fever is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|common]] in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Worldwide, about 600 million people live in endemic areas. The WHO estimates 200,000 cases of disease and 30,000 deaths a year occur. But the number of officially reported cases is far lower.\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Yellow fever Africa 2009.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|Areas with risk of yellow fever in Africa (2017)]]\nAn estimated 90% of the infections occur on the African continent.<ref name=Toll2009/> In 2008, the largest number of recorded cases was in [[Togo]].

Beginning in 1903, the campaign led by [[Oswaldo Cruz]], then director general of public health, resulted not only in eradicating the disease but also in reshaping the physical landscape of Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro. During rainy seasons, Rio de Janeiro had regularly suffered floods, as water from the bay surrounding the city overflowed into Rio's narrow streets. Coupled with the poor drainage systems found throughout Rio, this created swampy conditions in the city's neighborhoods. Pools of stagnant water stood year-long in city streets and proved to be a fertile ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Thus, under Cruz's direction, public health units known as \"mosquito inspectors\" fiercely worked to combat yellow fever throughout Rio by spraying, exterminating rats, improving drainage, and destroying unsanitary housing. Ultimately, the city's sanitation and renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods. Its poor residents were pushed from city centers to Rio's suburbs, or to towns found in the outskirts of the city.

Though this threat was dealt with relatively quickly, the instability caused by the brief civil war may be what made it possible for another general, [[Nabopolassar]], to rise up and seize power in [[Babylonia]]. Sinsharishkun's inability to defeat Nabopolassar, despite repeated attempts over the course of several years, allowed Nabopolassar to consolidate power and form the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule.\n\nThe Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed [[Median empire|Median Empire]] under King [[Cyaxares]], then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked and razed [[Nineveh]], the Assyrian capital. Sinsharishkun's fate is unknown but it is assumed that he died in the defense of his capital. He was succeeded as king only by [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son, who rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at the city of [[Harran]].\n\n== Background and chronology ==\nThe period from a few years before the death of King [[Ashurbanipal]] to the [[Fall of Nineveh]] in 612 BC suffers from a distinct lack of surviving sources. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=121}}'' Although Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}''', this follows an inscription at [[Harran]] made by the mother of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] king [[Nabonidus]] nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of [[Nippur]] made in 631 BC.'''{{Sfn|Reade|1970|p=1}}''' To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} If Ashurbanipal's reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and Sinsharishkun in [[Babylon]], covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=246}}\n\nAshurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince (probably Ashur-etil-ilani) were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=|pp=122\u2013123}}'' Ashur-etil-ilani succeeded Ashurbanipal as king in 631 BC and ruled until his own death in 627 BC. It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Sinsharishkun fought with Ashur-etil-ilani for the throne.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=126}}''\n\nSinsharishkun has sometimes historically and erroneously been known as ''Esarhaddon II'' after a letter written by [[Serua-eterat]], a daughter of Sinsharishkun's grandfather King [[Esarhaddon]]. The chronology and relations of the royal family were uncertain and Serua-eterat was believed to have been too young to refer to the famous Esarhaddon. The idea of a separate Esarhaddon II as king has been abandoned by Assyriologists since the late 19th century,''{{Sfn|Johnston|1899|p=244}}'' but the name sometimes appears as a synonym of Sinsharishkun.'''''{{Sfn|Woodall|2018|p=108}}{{Sfn|Myers|1890|p=51}}'''''\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rise to the throne and revolt of Sin-shumu-lishir ===\nIn the middle of 627 BC, King Ashurbanipal's son and successor Ashur-etil-ilani died, leading to Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun ascending to the Assyrian throne.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Although it has been suggested by several historians, there is no evidence to prove the idea that Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed in a coup by his brother. Sinsharishkun's inscriptions state that he was selected for the kingship from among several of \"his equals\" (i.e., his brothers) by the gods.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=255}}''\n\nAlso dying at roughly the same time as Ashur-etil-ilani was the vassal king of Babylon, [[Kandalanu]], which led to Sinsharishkun also becoming the ruler of Babylon, as proven by inscriptions by him in southern cities such as Nippur, [[Uruk]], [[Sippar]] and Babylon itself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}'' Sinsharishkun's rule of Babylon did not last long, and almost immediately in the wake of him coming to the throne, the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] rebelled.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Sin-shumu-lishir had been a key figure in Assyria during Ashur-etil-ilani's reign, putting down several revolts and possibly being the ''de facto'' leader of the country. The rise of another king might have endangered his position and as such led him to revolt and attempt to seize power for himself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}''\n\nSin-shumu-lishir successfully seized control of some cities in northern [[Babylonia]], including Nippur and Babylon itself and would rule there for three months before Sinsharishkun defeated him.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Though both of them exercised control there, neither Sinsharishkun nor Sin-shumu-lishir officially claimed the title \"King of Babylon\" (only using \"King of Assyria\"), meaning that Babylonia experienced an interregnum of sorts.{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}}\n\n=== Rise of Babylon ===\n{{Main|Revolt of Babylon (626 BC)}}\n[[File:Meso2mil-English.JPG|left|thumb|Locations of some major [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] cities.]]\nSome months after Sin-shumu-lishir's revolt, another revolt began in Babylon. A general called Nabopolassar, possibly using the political instability caused by the previous revolt{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} and the ongoing interregnum in the south,{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}} assaulted both Nippur and Babylon.{{refn|It is also possible that Nabopolassar was an ally of Sin-shumu-lishir in the previous revolt and merely continued his rebellion, but this theory requires more assumptions without any concrete evidence.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}|group=\"n\"}} Nabopolassar's armies took the cities from the garrisons left there by Sinsharishkun but the Assyrian response was swift and in October of 626 BC, the Assyrian army recaptured Nippur and besieged Nabopolassar at Uruk. A simultaneous Assyrian attempt at recapturing Babylon itself, the last ever Assyrian action against the city, was repulsed by Nabopolassar's garrison and the attack at Uruk also failed.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned [[King of Babylon]] on November 22/23 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}} In 625\u2013623 BC, Sinsharishkun's forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. Initially, these campaigns were successful; in 625 BC the Assyrians took the city of Sippar and Nabopolassar's attempted reconquest of Nippur failed. Another of Assyria's vassals, [[Elam]], also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as [[Der (Sumer)|Der]], revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sinsharishkun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}}\n\nSinsharishkun might have ultimately been victorious had it not been for another revolt, led by an Assyrian general in the empire's western provinces in 622 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sinsharishkun and the Assyrian army to march on Nineveh, met a hastily organized army which surrendered without fighting and successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=263}}'' Understandably alarmed by this development, Sinsharishkun abandoned his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper after a hundred days of civil war, the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622\u2013620 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly in Nabopolassar's hands by 620 BC. Nippur was also conquered in 620 BC and Nabopolassar consolidated his rule over the entirety of Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}}\n\n=== Fall of the Assyrian Empire ===\n{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire}}\n[[File:Fall of nineveh.jpg|thumb|''Fall of Nineveh'' by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1829).]]\nThe next few years saw repeated Babylonian victories against the Assyrians. By 616 BC, Nabopolassar's armies had reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Realizing that the situation was dire, Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], marched his troops to aid Sinsharishkun. Psamtik had over the last few years campaigned to establish dominance over the small city-states of the [[Levant]] and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}} A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of [[Gablinu]] was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in failure after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the [[Euphrates]], only offering limited support.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}}\n\nFollowing this failure, Assyria quickly collapsed. In March 615 BC, Nabopolassar inflicted a crushing defeat at the Assyrian army at the banks of the [[Tigris]], pushing them back to the [[Little Zab]]. Although Nabopolassar's attempt at taking the city of [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria, in May of that same year failed and he retreated to the city of [[Tikrit|Takrit]], the Assyrians also failed to assault Takrit and put an end to him. After yet another failure, the Assyrian army returned to Assur. In October or November 615 BC, the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]] entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city [[Arrapha]] in preparation for a great final campaign against Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}} \n\nIn July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of [[Kalhu]] and [[Nineveh]] and successfully conquered the city [[Tarbisu]]. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. Shortly after Assur's fall, Sinsharishkun made his last attempt at a counterattack, rushing to rescue the besieged city of [[Rahilu]], but Nabopolassar's army had retreated before a battle could take place.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} \n\nIn April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar's fourteenth year as King of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. From June to August of that year, they besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|lengthy and brutal sack]].{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Sinsharishkun's fate is not entirely certain but it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.'''{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}}{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}'''\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Succession ===\n{{See also|Ashur-uballit II}}\n[[File:Alter Orient 0600BC.svg|thumb|Political map of the [[Near East]] ~600 BC. In the aftermath of its fall, the territory of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] was divided between the Neo-Babylonian and [[Median empire|Median Empires]].]]\nWith the destructions of Assur in 614 BC and Nineveh in 612 BC, the Assyrian empire had essentially ceased to exist.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}} Sinsharishkun was succeeded by another Assyrian king, [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son and probably the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at Nineveh from 626 and 623 BC. Ashur-uballit established himself in Harran in the west.{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}} Because Assur had been destroyed, Ashur-uballit could not undergo the traditional coronation of the Assyrian monarchs and could thus not be invested with the kingship by the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and because of this, inscriptions from his brief reign indicate that he was viewed as the legitimate ruler by his subjects, but still with the title of crown prince and not king. To the Assyrians, Sinsharishkun was the last true king.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\nAshur-uballit's rule at Harran lasted just three years and he fled the city when Nabopolassar's army approached in 610 BC.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}{{Sfn|Bassir|2018|p=198}}''' An attempt at [[Siege of Harran|recapturing]] Harran carried out with the remnants of the Assyrian army and Egyptian reinforcements in 609 BC failed, after which Ashur-uballit and the Assyrians he commanded disappear from history, never again to be mentioned in Babylonian sources.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=141}}{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}}\n\nThe [[Biblical]] [[Book of Nahum]] \"prophetically\" discusses the Fall of Nineveh, but it is unclear when it was written. It may have been written as early as during Ashurbanipal's Egyptian campaign in the 660s BC, or as late as around the time of Nineveh's actual fall. If it was written around 612 BC, the \"king of Assyria\" mentioned would be Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Walton|Matthews|p=791|Chavalas|2012}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.|author=|title=|source=[[Nahum]] 3:18, [[New International Version]]{{Sfn|Nahum 3:18||p=}}}}\n\n=== Reasons for the Fall of Assyria ===\nAlthough it has been a commonly circulated idea that one of the primary reasons that led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was a civil war between Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun over the throne which weakened Assyria, there is no contemporary text which suggests that this is true. No inscriptions mention a war or even a dispute between the two brothers. There were revolts at the beginnings of both the reign of Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun, but these were minor and dealt with relatively quickly. As such, protracted civil war between contenders to the Assyrian throne was probably not the reason for Assyria's fall.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=265}}''\n\nThe primary reason for Assyria's collapse in the reign of Sinsharishkun is more likely to be the failure to resolve the \"Babylonian problem\" which had plagued Assyrian kings since Assyria first conquered southern Mesopotamia. Despite the many attempts of the kings of the [[Sargonid dynasty]] to resolve the constant rebellions in the south in a variety of different ways; [[Sennacherib]]'s destruction of Babylon and [[Esarhaddon]]'s restoration of it, rebellions and insurrections remained common. Nabopolassar's revolt was the last in a long line of Babylonian uprisings against the Assyrians and Sinsharishkun's failure to stop it, despite trying for years, doomed his kingdom. The Neo-Babylonian threat, combined with the rise of the Median Empire (Assyria had for many years attempted to stop the formation of a unified Median state through repeated campaigns into Media) culminated in Assyria's destruction.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=266}}''\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}\nFrom one of his inscriptions commemorating his building projects at Nineveh,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}} Sinsharishkun's titles read as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, [[king of the Universe]], ''[missing portion]'' chosen of Ashur and Ninlil, beloved of Marduk and Sarpanitum, dear to the heart of ''[missing portion]'', the sure choice of the heart of Nabu and Marduk, favorite of ''[missing portion]'', whom Ashur, Ninlil, B\u00eal, Nabu, Sin, Nin-gal, Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela in the midst of his companions looked upon with sure favor and called his name for the kingship; whom they named in every metropolis, for the priesthood of every sanctuary and for the rule of all the people, to whose aid they kept coming, like his father and mother, slaying his enemies and bringing low his opponents, ''[missing portion]'' whom they created for the rulership of the universe and crowned with the crown of rulership among all ''[missing portion]'', for the guidance of his subjects, into whose hand Nabu, guardian of all things, placed a righteous scepter and a just staff ''[missing portion]''{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}}}}\n\nIn another inscription, commemorating his restoration of a temple, Sinsharishkun incorporates his ancestry:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, son of Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, [[king of Sumer and Akkad]], grandson of [[Esarhaddon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, great-grandson of [[Sennacherib]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, the unrivaled prince, descendant of [[Sargon II|Sargon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=413}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sargonid dynasty]]\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibF6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Sin-apla-iddina|title=Southern Mesopotamia in the time of Ashurbanipal|last=Ahmed|first=Sami Said|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3111033587|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFAhmed2018}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Bassir|first=Hussein|date=2018|title=The Egyptian expansion in the near east in the saite period|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52c/14c7ebc70abf1c2053fa944135cb51d6cd87.pdf|journal=Journal of Historical Archaeology & Anthropological Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013200|ref=CITEREFBassir2018|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Beaulieu|first=Paul-Alain|date=1997|title=The Fourth Year of Hostilities in the Land|url=https://www.academia.edu/1821361/The_Fourth_Year_of_Hostilities_in_the_Land|journal=Baghdader Mitteilungen|volume=28|issue=|pages=367\u2013394|ref=CITEREFBeaulieu1997|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/1011803|title=Von Babylon bis Jerusalem: Die Welt der altorientalischen K\u00f6nigsst\u00e4dte|last=Frahm|first=Eckhart|publisher=Reiss-Museum Mannheim|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Kabale und Liebe: Die k\u00f6nigliche Familie am Hof zu Ninive|ref=CITEREFFrahm1999}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Christopher|date=1899|title=A Recent Interpretation of the Letter of an Assyrian Princess|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=20|issue=|pages=244\u2013249|ref=CITEREFJohnston1899|jstor=592332|doi=10.2307/592332}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&f=true|title=The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule|last=Lipschits|first=Oled|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2005|isbn=978-1575060958|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLipschits2005}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/ancient-records-assyria-and-babylonia-volume-2-historical-records-assyria|title=Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia Volume 2: Historical Records of Assyria From Sargon to the End|last=Luckenbill|first=Daniel David|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1927|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLuckenbill1927}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:A_general_history_for_colleges_and_high_schools_(Myers,_1890).djvu/69|title=A General History for Colleges and High Schools|last=Myers|first=P.

Though this threat was dealt with relatively quickly, the instability caused by the brief civil war may be what made it possible for another general, [[Nabopolassar]], to rise up and seize power in [[Babylonia]]. Sinsharishkun's inability to defeat Nabopolassar, despite repeated attempts over the course of several years, allowed Nabopolassar to consolidate power and form the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule.\n\nThe Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed [[Median empire|Median Empire]] under King [[Cyaxares]], then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked and razed [[Nineveh]], the Assyrian capital. Sinsharishkun's fate is unknown but it is assumed that he died in the defense of his capital. He was succeeded as king only by [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son, who rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at the city of [[Harran]].\n\n== Background and chronology ==\nThe period from a few years before the death of King [[Ashurbanipal]] to the [[Fall of Nineveh]] in 612 BC suffers from a distinct lack of surviving sources. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=121}}'' Although Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}''', this follows an inscription at [[Harran]] made by the mother of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] king [[Nabonidus]] nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of [[Nippur]] made in 631 BC.'''{{Sfn|Reade|1970|p=1}}''' To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} If Ashurbanipal's reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and Sinsharishkun in [[Babylon]], covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=246}}\n\nAshurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince (probably Ashur-etil-ilani) were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=|pp=122\u2013123}}'' Ashur-etil-ilani succeeded Ashurbanipal as king in 631 BC and ruled until his own death in 627 BC. It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Sinsharishkun fought with Ashur-etil-ilani for the throne.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=126}}''\n\nSinsharishkun has sometimes historically and erroneously been known as ''Esarhaddon II'' after a letter written by [[Serua-eterat]], a daughter of Sinsharishkun's grandfather King [[Esarhaddon]]. The chronology and relations of the royal family were uncertain and Serua-eterat was believed to have been too young to refer to the famous Esarhaddon. The idea of a separate Esarhaddon II as king has been abandoned by Assyriologists since the late 19th century,''{{Sfn|Johnston|1899|p=244}}'' but the name sometimes appears as a synonym of Sinsharishkun.'''''{{Sfn|Woodall|2018|p=108}}{{Sfn|Myers|1890|p=51}}'''''\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rise to the throne and revolt of Sin-shumu-lishir ===\nIn the middle of 627 BC, King Ashurbanipal's son and successor Ashur-etil-ilani died, leading to Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun ascending to the Assyrian throne.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Although it has been suggested by several historians, there is no evidence to prove the idea that Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed in a coup by his brother. Sinsharishkun's inscriptions state that he was selected for the kingship from among several of \"his equals\" (e.g., his brothers) by the gods.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=255}}''\n\nAlso dying at roughly the same time as Ashur-etil-ilani was the vassal king of Babylon, [[Kandalanu]], which led to Sinsharishkun also becoming the ruler of Babylon, as proven by inscriptions by him in southern cities such as Nippur, [[Uruk]], [[Sippar]] and Babylon itself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}'' Sinsharishkun's rule of Babylon did not last long, and almost immediately in the wake of him coming to the throne, the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] rebelled.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Sin-shumu-lishir had been a key figure in Assyria during Ashur-etil-ilani's reign, putting down several revolts and possibly being the ''de facto'' leader of the country. The rise of another king might have endangered his position and as such led him to revolt and attempt to seize power for himself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}''\n\nSin-shumu-lishir successfully seized control of some cities in northern [[Babylonia]], including Nippur and Babylon itself and would rule there for three months before Sinsharishkun defeated him.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Though both of them exercised control there, neither Sinsharishkun nor Sin-shumu-lishir officially claimed the title \"King of Babylon\" (only using \"King of Assyria\"), meaning that Babylonia experienced an interregnum of sorts.{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}}\n\n=== Rise of Babylon ===\n{{Main|Revolt of Babylon (626 BC)}}\n[[File:Meso2mil-English.JPG|left|thumb|Locations of some major [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] cities.]]\nSome months after Sin-shumu-lishir's revolt, another revolt began in Babylon. A general called Nabopolassar, possibly using the political instability caused by the previous revolt{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} and the ongoing interregnum in the south,{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}} assaulted both Nippur and Babylon.{{refn|It is also possible that Nabopolassar was an ally of Sin-shumu-lishir in the previous revolt and merely continued his rebellion, but this theory requires more assumptions without any concrete evidence.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}|group=\"n\"}} Nabopolassar's armies took the cities from the garrisons left there by Sinsharishkun but the Assyrian response was swift and in October of 626 BC, the Assyrian army recaptured Nippur and besieged Nabopolassar at Uruk. A simultaneous Assyrian attempt at recapturing Babylon itself, the last ever Assyrian action against the city, was repulsed by Nabopolassar's garrison and the attack at Uruk also failed.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned [[King of Babylon]] on November 22/23 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}} In 625\u2013623 BC, Sinsharishkun's forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. Initially, these campaigns were successful; in 625 BC the Assyrians took the city of Sippar and Nabopolassar's attempted reconquest of Nippur failed. Another of Assyria's vassals, [[Elam]], also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as [[Der (Sumer)|Der]], revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sinsharishkun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}}\n\nSinsharishkun might have ultimately been victorious had it not been for another revolt, led by an Assyrian general in the empire's western provinces in 622 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sinsharishkun and the Assyrian army to march on Nineveh, met a hastily organized army which surrendered without fighting and successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=263}}'' Understandably alarmed by this development, Sinsharishkun abandoned his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper after a hundred days of civil war, the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622\u2013620 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly in Nabopolassar's hands by 620 BC. Nippur was also conquered in 620 BC and Nabopolassar consolidated his rule over the entirety of Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}}\n\n=== Fall of the Assyrian Empire ===\n{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire}}\n[[File:Fall of nineveh.jpg|thumb|''Fall of Nineveh'' by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1829).]]\nThe next few years saw repeated Babylonian victories against the Assyrians. By 616 BC, Nabopolassar's armies had reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Realizing that the situation was dire, Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], marched his troops to aid Sinsharishkun. Psamtik had over the last few years campaigned to establish dominance over the small city-states of the [[Levant]] and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}} A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of [[Gablinu]] was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in failure after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the [[Euphrates]], only offering limited support.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}}\n\nFollowing this failure, Assyria quickly collapsed. In March 615 BC, Nabopolassar inflicted a crushing defeat at the Assyrian army at the banks of the [[Tigris]], pushing them back to the [[Little Zab]]. Although Nabopolassar's attempt at taking the city of [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria, in May of that same year failed and he retreated to the city of [[Tikrit|Takrit]], the Assyrians also failed to assault Takrit and put an end to him. After yet another failure, the Assyrian army returned to Assur. In October or November 615 BC, the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]] entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city [[Arrapha]] in preparation for a great final campaign against Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}} \n\nIn July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of [[Kalhu]] and [[Nineveh]] and successfully conquered the city [[Tarbisu]]. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. Shortly after Assur's fall, Sinsharishkun made his last attempt at a counterattack, rushing to rescue the besieged city of [[Rahilu]], but Nabopolassar's army had retreated before a battle could take place.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} \n\nIn April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar's fourteenth year as King of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. From June to August of that year, they besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|lengthy and brutal sack]].{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Sinsharishkun's fate is not entirely certain but it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.'''{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}}{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}'''\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Succession ===\n{{See also|Ashur-uballit II}}\n[[File:Alter Orient 0600BC.svg|thumb|Political map of the [[Near East]] ~600 BC. In the aftermath of its fall, the territory of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] was divided between the Neo-Babylonian and [[Median empire|Median Empires]].]]\nWith the destructions of Assur in 614 BC and Nineveh in 612 BC, the Assyrian empire had essentially ceased to exist.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}} Sinsharishkun was succeeded by another Assyrian king, [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son and probably the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at Nineveh from 626 and 623 BC. Ashur-uballit established himself in Harran in the west.{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}} Because Assur had been destroyed, Ashur-uballit could not undergo the traditional coronation of the Assyrian monarchs and could thus not be invested with the kingship by the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and because of this, inscriptions from his brief reign indicate that he was viewed as the legitimate ruler by his subjects, but still with the title of crown prince and not king. To the Assyrians, Sinsharishkun was the last true king.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\nAshur-uballit's rule at Harran lasted just three years and he fled the city when Nabopolassar's army approached in 610 BC.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}{{Sfn|Bassir|2018|p=198}}''' An attempt at [[Siege of Harran|recapturing]] Harran carried out with the remnants of the Assyrian army and Egyptian reinforcements in 609 BC failed, after which Ashur-uballit and the Assyrians he commanded disappear from history, never again to be mentioned in Babylonian sources.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=141}}{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}}\n\nThe [[Biblical]] [[Book of Nahum]] \"prophetically\" discusses the Fall of Nineveh, but it is unclear when it was written. It may have been written as early as during Ashurbanipal's Egyptian campaign in the 660s BC, or as late as around the time of Nineveh's actual fall. If it was written around 612 BC, the \"king of Assyria\" mentioned would be Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Walton|Matthews|p=791|Chavalas|2012}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.|author=|title=|source=[[Nahum]] 3:18, [[New International Version]]{{Sfn|Nahum 3:18||p=}}}}\n\n=== Reasons for the Fall of Assyria ===\nAlthough it has been a commonly circulated idea that one of the primary reasons that led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was a civil war between Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun over the throne which weakened Assyria, there is no contemporary text which suggests that this is true. No inscriptions mention a war or even a dispute between the two brothers. There were revolts at the beginnings of both the reign of Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun, but these were minor and dealt with relatively quickly. As such, protracted civil war between contenders to the Assyrian throne was probably not the reason for Assyria's fall.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=265}}''\n\nThe primary reason for Assyria's collapse in the reign of Sinsharishkun is more likely to be the failure to resolve the \"Babylonian problem\" which had plagued Assyrian kings since Assyria first conquered southern Mesopotamia. Despite the many attempts of the kings of the [[Sargonid dynasty]] to resolve the constant rebellions in the south in a variety of different ways; [[Sennacherib]]'s destruction of Babylon and [[Esarhaddon]]'s restoration of it, rebellions and insurrections remained common. Nabopolassar's revolt was the last in a long line of Babylonian uprisings against the Assyrians and Sinsharishkun's failure to stop it, despite trying for years, doomed his kingdom. The Neo-Babylonian threat, combined with the rise of the Median Empire (Assyria had for many years attempted to stop the formation of a unified Median state through repeated campaigns into Media) culminated in Assyria's destruction.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=266}}''\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}\nFrom one of his inscriptions commemorating his building projects at Nineveh,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}} Sinsharishkun's titles read as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, [[king of the Universe]], ''[missing portion]'' chosen of Ashur and Ninlil, beloved of Marduk and Sarpanitum, dear to the heart of ''[missing portion]'', the sure choice of the heart of Nabu and Marduk, favorite of ''[missing portion]'', whom Ashur, Ninlil, B\u00eal, Nabu, Sin, Nin-gal, Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela in the midst of his companions looked upon with sure favor and called his name for the kingship; whom they named in every metropolis, for the priesthood of every sanctuary and for the rule of all the people, to whose aid they kept coming, like his father and mother, slaying his enemies and bringing low his opponents, ''[missing portion]'' whom they created for the rulership of the universe and crowned with the crown of rulership among all ''[missing portion]'', for the guidance of his subjects, into whose hand Nabu, guardian of all things, placed a righteous scepter and a just staff ''[missing portion]''{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}}}}\n\nIn another inscription, commemorating his restoration of a temple, Sinsharishkun incorporates his ancestry:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, son of Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, [[king of Sumer and Akkad]], grandson of [[Esarhaddon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, great-grandson of [[Sennacherib]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, the unrivaled prince, descendant of [[Sargon II|Sargon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=413}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sargonid dynasty]]\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibF6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Sin-apla-iddina|title=Southern Mesopotamia in the time of Ashurbanipal|last=Ahmed|first=Sami Said|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3111033587|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFAhmed2018}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Bassir|first=Hussein|date=2018|title=The Egyptian expansion in the near east in the saite period|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52c/14c7ebc70abf1c2053fa944135cb51d6cd87.pdf|journal=Journal of Historical Archaeology & Anthropological Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013200|ref=CITEREFBassir2018|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Beaulieu|first=Paul-Alain|date=1997|title=The Fourth Year of Hostilities in the Land|url=https://www.academia.edu/1821361/The_Fourth_Year_of_Hostilities_in_the_Land|journal=Baghdader Mitteilungen|volume=28|issue=|pages=367\u2013394|ref=CITEREFBeaulieu1997|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/1011803|title=Von Babylon bis Jerusalem: Die Welt der altorientalischen K\u00f6nigsst\u00e4dte|last=Frahm|first=Eckhart|publisher=Reiss-Museum Mannheim|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Kabale und Liebe: Die k\u00f6nigliche Familie am Hof zu Ninive|ref=CITEREFFrahm1999}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Christopher|date=1899|title=A Recent Interpretation of the Letter of an Assyrian Princess|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=20|issue=|pages=244\u2013249|ref=CITEREFJohnston1899|jstor=592332|doi=10.2307/592332}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&f=true|title=The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule|last=Lipschits|first=Oled|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2005|isbn=978-1575060958|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLipschits2005}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/ancient-records-assyria-and-babylonia-volume-2-historical-records-assyria|title=Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia Volume 2: Historical Records of Assyria From Sargon to the End|last=Luckenbill|first=Daniel David|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1927|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLuckenbill1927}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:A_general_history_for_colleges_and_high_schools_(Myers,_1890).djvu/69|title=A General History for Colleges and High Schools|last=Myers|first=P.
