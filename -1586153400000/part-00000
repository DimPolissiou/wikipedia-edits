Typically called just '''ruby''' or '''rubi''', such annotations are most commonly used as pronunciation guides for characters that are likely to be unfamiliar to the reader.\n\n== Examples ==\nHere is an example of Japanese ruby characters (called ''[[furigana]]'') for [[Tokyo]] (\"{{lang|ja|\u6771\u4eac}}\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Alternatively, sometimes foreign words (usually English) are printed with furigana implying the meaning, and vice versa. Textbooks usually write [[Kanji#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|on-readings]] with katakana and [[Kanji#Kun'yomi (native reading)|kun-readings]] with hiragana.\n\nHere is an example of the Bopomofo ruby characters for [[Beijing]] (\"{{lang|zh-hant|\u5317\u4eac}}\"):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Typically, unlike the example shown above<!--TODO: Edit example when support for CSS (ruby-position: side;) is implemented in browsers or a better kludge than was used.-->, zhuyin is used with a vertical traditional writing and zhuyin is written on the right side of the characters. In mainland China, horizontal script is used and ruby characters (pinyin) are written above the Chinese characters. \n\nBooks with phonetic guides (especially pinyin) are popular with children and foreigners learning Chinese.\n\nHere is an example of the Korean ruby characters for [[Korea]] (\"{{lang|ko|\u97d3\u570b}}\"):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Ruby characters can be quite common on signs in certain parts of South Korea.\n\nHere is an example of the Vietnamese ruby characters for [[Hanoi]] (\"{{lang|vi|\u6cb3\u5167}}\"):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is generally used with spoken dialogue and applies only to Japanese publications. The most common form of ruby is called ''furigana'' or ''yomigana'' and is found in Japanese instructional books, newspapers, comics and books for children.\n\nIn Japanese, certain characters, such as the [[sokuon]] ({{lang|ja|\u4fc3\u97f3}}) (little ''tsu'', {{lang|ja|\u3063}}) that indicates a pause before the consonant it precedes, are normally written at about half the size of normal characters. When written as ruby, such characters are usually the same size as other ruby characters. Advancements in technology now allow certain characters to render accurately.{{clarification needed|date=December 2016}}<ref name=\"w3c-spec\">{{cite web\n|author1=Marcin Sawicki |author2=Michel Suignard |author3=Masayasu Ishikawa |author4=Martin D\u00fcrst |author5=Tex Texin |title=Ruby Annotation\n|date=2001-05-31\n|work=[[W3C Recommendation]]\n|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]\n|accessdate=2007-02-14\n|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby\n}}</ref>\n\nIn Chinese, the practice of providing phonetic cues via ruby is rare, but does occur systematically in grade-school level text books or dictionaries. The Chinese have no special name for this practice, as it is not as widespread as in Japan. In Taiwan, it is known as \"[[Bopomofo|zhuyin]]\", from the name of the phonetic system employed for this purpose there. It is virtually always used vertically, because publications are normally in a vertical format, and zhuyin is not as easy to read when presented horizontally{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Where zhuyin is not used, other Chinese phonetic systems like [[pinyin]] are employed.\n\n[[File:\u59d4\u73ed\u5fa9\u6d3b\u6f22\u5583\u8d8a\u5357.png|thumb|right|An example of Vietnamese ruby text]]\n\nIn academic settings, Vietnamese text written in {{lang|vi|[[ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]]}} or {{lang|vi|[[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]]}} may be glossed with {{lang|vi|[[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]}} ruby for modern readers.{{sfn|Lunde|2009|p=529}}\n\nSometimes [[interlinear glosses]] are visually similar to ruby, appearing above or below the main text in smaller type. However, this is a distinct practice used for helping students of a foreign language by giving glosses for the words in a text, as opposed to the pronunciation of lesser-known characters.\n\nRuby annotation can also be used in handwriting.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Agate (typography)}}\n[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]] Eonhae'' uses [[hanja]] and small [[hangul]] for ruby on right below]]\n\nIn British typography, ''ruby'' was originally the [[Point (typography)#Traditional point-size names|name for type]] with a height of 5.5 [[point (typography)|points]], which printers used for interlinear annotations in printed documents. In Japanese, rather than referring to a font size, the word became the name for typeset ''furigana''.  When transliterated back into English, some texts rendered the word as ''rubi'', (a typical [[romanisation]] of the Japanese word {{lang|ja|\u30eb\u30d3}}, instead of {{lang|ja|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc}} (''rub\u012b''), the expected transliteration of ''ruby''). However, the spelling \"ruby\" has become more common since the [[W3C]] published a recommendation for ''ruby [[markup language|markup]]''. In the US, the font size had been called \"[[Agate (typography)|agate]]\", a term in use since 1831 according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\n== HTML markup ==\n{{anchor|HTML}}\nThis information is out of date and has been superseded by the inclusion of Ruby support in [[HTML5]].

Typically, unlike the example shown above<!--TODO: Edit example when support for CSS (ruby-position: side;) is implemented in browsers or a better kludge than was used.-->, zhuyin is used with a vertical traditional writing and zhuyin is written on the right side of the characters. In mainland China, horizontal script is used and ruby characters (pinyin) are written above the Chinese characters. \n\nBooks with phonetic guides (especially pinyin) are popular with children and foreigners learning Chinese.\n\nHere is an example of the Korean ruby characters for [[Korea]] (\"{{lang|ko|\u97d3\u570b}}\"):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Ruby characters can be quite common on signs in certain parts of South Korea.\n\nHere is an example of the Vietnamese ruby characters for [[Hanoi]] (\"{{lang|vi|\u6cb3\u5167}}\"):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is generally used with spoken dialogue and applies only to Japanese publications. The most common form of ruby is called ''furigana'' or ''yomigana'' and is found in Japanese instructional books, newspapers, comics and books for children.\n\nIn Japanese, certain characters, such as the [[sokuon]] ({{lang|ja|\u4fc3\u97f3}}) (little ''tsu'', {{lang|ja|\u3063}}) that indicates a pause before the consonant it precedes, are normally written at about half the size of normal characters. When written as ruby, such characters are usually the same size as other ruby characters. Advancements in technology now allow certain characters to render accurately.{{clarification needed|date=December 2016}}<ref name=\"w3c-spec\">{{cite web\n|author1=Marcin Sawicki |author2=Michel Suignard |author3=Masayasu Ishikawa |author4=Martin D\u00fcrst |author5=Tex Texin |title=Ruby Annotation\n|date=2001-05-31\n|work=[[W3C Recommendation]]\n|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]\n|accessdate=2007-02-14\n|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby\n}}</ref>\n\nIn Chinese, the practice of providing phonetic cues via ruby is rare, but does occur systematically in grade-school level text books or dictionaries. The Chinese have no special name for this practice, as it is not as widespread as in Japan. In Taiwan, it is known as \"[[Bopomofo|zhuyin]]\", from the name of the phonetic system employed for this purpose there. It is virtually always used vertically, because publications are normally in a vertical format, and zhuyin is not as easy to read when presented horizontally{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Where zhuyin is not used, other Chinese phonetic systems like [[pinyin]] are employed.\n\n[[File:\u59d4\u73ed\u5fa9\u6d3b\u6f22\u5583\u8d8a\u5357.png|thumb|right|An example of Vietnamese ruby text]]\n\nIn academic settings, Vietnamese text written in {{lang|vi|[[ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]]}} or {{lang|vi|[[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]]}} may be glossed with {{lang|vi|[[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]}} ruby for modern readers.{{sfn|Lunde|2009|p=529}}\n\nSometimes [[interlinear glosses]] are visually similar to ruby, appearing above or below the main text in smaller type. However, this is a distinct practice used for helping students of a foreign language by giving glosses for the words in a text, as opposed to the pronunciation of lesser-known characters.\n\nRuby annotation can also be used in handwriting.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Agate (typography)}}\n[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]] Eonhae'' uses [[hanja]] and small [[hangul]] for ruby on right below]]\n\nIn British typography, ''ruby'' was originally the [[Point (typography)#Traditional point-size names|name for type]] with a height of 5.5 [[point (typography)|points]], which printers used for interlinear annotations in printed documents. In Japanese, rather than referring to a font size, the word became the name for typeset ''furigana''.  When transliterated back into English, some texts rendered the word as ''rubi'', (a typical [[romanisation]] of the Japanese word {{lang|ja|\u30eb\u30d3}}, instead of {{lang|ja|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc}} (''rub\u012b''), the expected transliteration of ''ruby''). However, the spelling \"ruby\" has become more common since the [[W3C]] published a recommendation for ''ruby [[markup language|markup]]''. In the US, the font size had been called \"[[Agate (typography)|agate]]\", a term in use since 1831 according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\n== HTML markup ==\n{{anchor|HTML}}\nThis information is out of date and has been superseded by the inclusion of Ruby support in [[HTML5]].

Bell Jr.''' (December 3, 1914 - January 2, 2009) was an American author and an expert on early American History, Science, the [[American Philosophical Society]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]].\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\nBell Jr was born in [[Newburgh, New York]] and grew up in suburban [[Philadelphia]]. He went to school at [[Lower Merion High School]] (PA) and graduated from here in 1931.\n\n=== Education and career ===\nAfter Bell graduated from Lower Menon High School, he enrolled in Dickinson College. He began studying law but did not complete the course, deciding instead to pursue his interest in history.\n\nBell joined the Cumberland Star Lodge of Carlisle and achieved the status of Master Mason. He wrote the history of the Lodge to mark its 150th anniversary. Bell earned a doctorate in history in 1947.\n\nBell tried to enlist in the Army and the Navy when the United States entered the World War II, but was rejected due to poor eyesight. He drove an ambulance in [[North Africa]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]].

{"title_page": "Overlapping markup", "text_new": "In [[markup language]]s and the [[digital humanities]], '''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to (...) linguistically annotated data [was] to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4 {{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}}.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,{{sfn|Chiarcos|Dipper|G\u00f6tze|Leser|L\u00fcdeling|Ritz|Stede|2008|}} and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\nA disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4{{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}} In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== New languages ===\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

'''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to (...) linguistically annotated data [was] to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\">{{cite journal |last1=Ide |first1=Nancy |last2=Chiarcos |first2=Christian |last3=Stede |first3=Manfred |last4=Cassidy |first4=Steve |title=Designing Annotation Schemes: From Model to Representation |journal=Nancy Ide & James Pustejowsky (eds.), Handbook of Linguistic Annotation |date=2017 |page=99 |pages=|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9789402408799 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}</ref> \n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,<ref name=\"habla-p99\">{{cite journal |last1=Chiarcos |first1=Christian |last2=Dipper |first2=Stefanie |last3=G\u00f6tze |first3=Michael |last4=Leser |first4=Ulf |last5=L\u00fcdeling |first5=Anke |last6=Ritz |first6=Julia |last7=Stede |first7=Manfred |title=A flexible framework for integrating annotations from different tools and tagsets |journal=Traitement Automatique des Languages |date=2008 |volume=49 |issue=2 |page=271-293 |url=https://www.atala.org/content/flexible-framework-integrating-annotations-different-tools-and-tag-sets}}</ref> and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\nA disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\"/> In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== New languages ===\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup.

But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

Article Two vests the power of the executive branch in the office of the [[president of the United States]], lays out the procedures for electing and removing the president, and establishes the president's powers and responsibilities.\n\nSection 1 of Article Two establishes the positions of the president and the vice president, and sets the term of both offices at four years. Section 1's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] declares that the executive power of the federal government is vested in the president and, along with the Vesting Clauses of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]], establishes the [[separation of powers]] among\nthe three branches of government. Section 1 also establishes the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], the body charged with electing the president and the vice president. Section 1 provides that each state chooses members of the Electoral College in a manner directed by each state's respective legislature, with the states granted electors equal to their combined representation in both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Section 1 lays out the procedures of the Electoral College and requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to hold a [[contingent election]] to select the president if no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote. Section 1 also sets forth the eligibility requirements for the office of the president, provides procedures in case of a presidential vacancy, and requires the president to take an [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]].\n\nSection 2 of Article Two lays out '''the powers of the presidency''', establishing that the president serves as the commander-in-chief of the military, among many other roles. This section gives the president the power to grant [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardons]]. \n\nSection 2 also requires the \"principal officer\" of any executive department to tender advice. Though not required by Article Two, President [[George Washington]] organized the principal officers of the executive departments into the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], a practice that subsequent presidents have followed. The [[Treaty Clause]] grants the president the power to enter into treaties with the approval of two-thirds of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The [[Appointments Clause]] grants the president the power to appoint judges and public officials subject to the [[advice and consent]] of the Senate, which in practice has meant that presidential appointees must be [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|confirmed]] by a majority vote in the Senate. The Appointments Clause also establishes that Congress can, by law, allow the president, the courts, or the heads of departments to appoint \"inferior officers\" without requiring the advice and consent of the Senate. The final clause of Section 2 grants the president the power to make [[recess appointment]]s to fill vacancies that occur when the Senate is in recess.\n\nSection 3 of Article Two lays out the responsibilities of the president, granting the president the power to convene both houses of Congress, receive foreign representatives, and commission all federal officers. Section 3 requires the president to inform Congress of the \"state of the union\"; since 1913 this has taken the form of a speech referred to as the [[State of the Union]]. The Recommendation Clause requires the president to recommend measures s/he deems \"necessary and expedient.\" The Take Care Clause requires the president to obey and enforce all laws, though the president retains some discretion in interpreting the laws and determining how to enforce them. Section 4 of Article Two establishes that the president and other officers can be removed from office through the [[impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] process, which is further described in Article One.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: President and vice president==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Executive Power===\n{{quote|The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.

Similar clauses are found in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]]; the former bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the Supreme Court, and other federal courts established by law.<ref>{{cite web| title=Vesting Clause Law and Legal Definition| url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/v/vesting-clause/| website=uslegal.com| publisher=USLegal| accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref> These three articles together secure a [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and individually, each one entrenches [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] on the operation and power of the other two branches.<ref>{{cite web| last=Monk| first=Linda R.| title=We the People| url=http://www.pbs.org/tpt/constitution-usa-peter-sagal/we-the-people/#.Xdq-825FxPY| work=Constitution USA with Peter Segal| publisher=PBS| accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArticle I grants [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|certain powers]] to Congress, and the Vesting Clause does not reassign those powers to the President. In fact, because those actions require legislation passed by Congress which must be signed by the president to take effect, those powers are not strictly executive powers granted to or retained by Congress per se. Nor were they retained by the U.S. Congress as leftovers from the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Confederation, Continental Congress and its powers were abolished at the time the new U.S. Congress was seated and the new federal government formally and officially replaced its interim predecessor. And although the president is implicitly denied the power to unilaterally declare war, a declaration of war is not in and of itself a vehicle of executive power since it is literally just a public declaration that the U.S. government considers itself \"at war\" with a foreign political entity.\n\nRegardless of the inability to declare war, the president does have the power to unilaterally order military action in defense of the United States pursuant to \"a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces\". By U.S. law, this power is limited in that he must notify Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations, explaining the source of his authority for the action. Once proper legal notification is given to the required members of Congress, military action can continue for up to 60 days without further authorization from Congress, or up to 90 days if the president \"determines and certifies to the Congress in writing that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of United States Armed Forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp | title= War Powers Resolution|publisher=Avalon Project }}</ref>\n\nAs treaties are by U.S. law official agreements with foreign governments recognized as such only after Senate ratification, the president obviously cannot make treaties unilaterally. However, the president does determine and decide U.S. foreign policy, and can enter into non-binding discussions and give conditional approval to agreements reached with foreign governments subject to Senate ratification at a future date.\n\nAdditionally, since official treaties are specifically created under and by constitutional U.S. law, and are entered into by both government and the people as a whole, in their capacity as head of state and as the single individual representative of the United States and its citizens, the president does have Coauthority and Constitutional duty to unilaterally withdraw the United States from treaties if he or she determines the best interests and well being of the U.S. and its citizens are benefited by doing so.\n\nAs far as presidential appointments, as with treaties a person is not officially and legally appointed to a position until their appointment is approved by the Senate. Prior to Senate approval and publication of that approval along with an official date and time for their swearing-in and assumption of duties and responsibilities, they are nominees rather than appointees. And again, the president nominates people for specific positions at their pleasure and can do so without or in spite of Senate advice. Senate consent occurs when a majority of senators votes to approve and therefore appoint a nominee.\n\nThe head of the Executive Branch is the president. Although also named in this first clause, the vice president is not constitutionally vested with any executive power. Nonetheless, the Constitution dictates that the president and vice president are to be elected at the same time, for the same term, and by the same constituency. The framers' intent was to preserve the independence of the executive branch should the person who was vice president succeed to the duties of the presidency.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-ii| title=Article Two: Executive Branch| website=constitutioncenter.org| publisher=National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Method of choosing electors===\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution the president and vice president are chosen by [[Electoral College (United States)|electors]], under a constitutional grant of authority delegated to the legislatures of the several states.  The Constitution reserves the choice of the precise manner for creating electors to the will of the state legislatures. It does not define or delimit what process a state legislature may use to create its ''state'' college of electors.  In practice, the state legislatures have generally chosen to create electors through an indirect popular vote, since the 1820s. Most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system in which the candidate with the most votes in the state gets all the electoral votes.<ref name=\"ncsl.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-electoral-college.aspx |title=The Electoral College|website=ncsl.org|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref> Maine and Nebraska allow individual congressional districts to elect one elector.\n\nIn an indirect popular vote, it is the names of the candidates who are on the ballot to be elected.

The actual electors being voted for are usually selected by the candidate's party.  There are a few cases where some electors have refused to vote for the designated candidate.  (See \"Faithless Elector\".) Many states have mandated in law that electors ''shall'' cast their electoral college ballot for the designated presidential candidate.<ref name=\"ncsl.org\"/> The constitutionality of such mandates is uncertain.<ref name=\"nyt-USCA\">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Trip |title=Electoral College Members Can Defy Voters\u2019 Wishes, Court Rules |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/politics/electoral-college-faithless-elector.html |accessdate=23 August 2019 |publisher=NY Times |date=22 Aug 2019}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nEach state chooses as many electors as it has representatives and senators representing it in Congress. Under the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]], the [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] may choose no more electors than the state with the lowest number of electoral votes (in effect, three electors), although since that amendment's ratification the District's population has never reached the threshold that would otherwise entitle it to choose four or more electors. U.S. senators, representatives and federal government officials are barred from becoming electors; in practice, the two major federal parties frequently select senior state party and government officials (up to and including governors) to serve as electors.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Electors===\n{{quote|The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.

Once chosen, the electors meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the president and vice president. Originally, each elector cast two votes for president; at least one of the individuals voted for had to be from a state different from the elector's. The individual with the majority of votes became president, and the runner-up became vice president. In case of a tie between candidates who received votes from a majority of electors, the House of Representatives would choose one of the tied candidates; if no person received a majority, then the House could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes. When the House voted, each state delegation cast one vote, and the vote of a majority of states was necessary to choose a president. If second-place candidates were tied, then the Senate broke the tie. A quorum in the House consisted of at least one member from two-thirds of the state delegations; there was no special quorum for the Senate. This procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie, and nearly resulted in a [[1800 United States presidential election#Contingent election|deadlock in the House]].\n\nWhile the Constitution reflects the Framers' clear preference for the president to be elected by a constituency independent of the Congress, one of the most palpable limitations created by the stipulation that electors meet in their respective states as opposed to a single venue was that given the constraints of eighteenth-century technology there was no practical means for that constituency to resolve deadlocked elections in a timely manner, thus necessitating the involvement of Congress in resolving deadlocked elections. Obviously, having the electors meet in the national capital or some other single venue could have permitted the electors to choose a president by means of an [[exhaustive ballot]] without Congressional involvement, but the Framers were dissuaded from such an arrangement by two major considerations. First, it would have been quite burdensome for electors from distant states to travel to the national capital using eighteenth century means for the sole purpose of electing the president \u2013 since they were to be barred from simultaneously serving in the federal government in any other capacity, electors would likely have no other reason to go there. But probably even more importantly, many Framers genuinely feared that if the electors met in a single venue, especially under the initial assumption that they would [[unpledged elector|act independently]] as opposed to being bound to vote for particular candidates, they would be vulnerable to the influence of mobs who might try to ensure a particular result by means of threats and intimidation \u2013 this had been a fairly common occurrence in European elections for powerful officials by relatively small constituencies (for example, and perhaps in particular, in [[papal election]]s) from the Middle Ages up to the Constitution's creation.\n\nThe 12th Amendment introduced a number of important changes to the procedure. Now, electors do not cast two votes for president; rather, they cast one vote for president and another for vice president. In case no presidential candidate receives a majority, the House chooses from the top three (not five, as before the 12th Amendment). The Amendment also requires the Senate to choose the vice president from those with the two highest figures if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes (rather than only if there's a tie for second for president).  It also stipulates that to be the vice president, a person must be qualified to be the president.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Election day===\n[[File:A certificate for the electoral vote for Rutherford B.

When [[William Henry Harrison]] died in office, a debate arose over whether the vice president would become president, or if he would just inherit the powers, thus becoming an acting president. Harrison's vice president, [[John Tyler]], believed that he had the right to become president. However, many senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler took the Oath of Office as president, setting a precedent that made it possible for later vice presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the president's death. The \"Tyler Precedent\" established that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president.\n\nThe Congress may provide for a [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]] beyond the vice president. The current [[Presidential Succession Act]] establishes the order as the speaker of the House of Representatives, the president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate and then the fifteen Cabinet secretaries in order of each department's establishment. There are concerns regarding the constitutionality of having members of Congress in the line of succession, however, as this clause specifies that only an \"[[officer of the United States]]\" may be designated as a presidential successor. Constitutional scholars from [[James Madison]] to the present day have argued that the term \"officer\" excludes members of Congress.\n\nThe [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] explicitly states that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president, and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president. The Amendment further provides that the president, or the vice president and Cabinet, can declare the president unable to discharge his duties, in which case the vice president becomes Acting president. If the declaration is done by the vice president and Cabinet, the Amendment permits the president to take control back, unless the vice president and Cabinet challenge the president and two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the vice president and Cabinet. If the declaration is done by the president, he may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Salary===\n{{Redirect|Domestic Emoluments Clause||Emoluments Clause (disambiguation){{!}}Emoluments Clause}}\n{{See also|President of the United States#Compensation}}\n\n{{quote|The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.}}\n\nThe president's salary, currently $400,000 a year,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/102|title=3 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f102.

It is sometimes asserted that the oath bestows upon the president the power to do whatever is necessary to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.\" [[Andrew Jackson]], while vetoing an Act for the renewal of the charter of the national bank, implied that the president could refuse to execute statutes that he felt were unconstitutional. In suspending the privilege of the [[habeas corpus|writ of ''habeas corpus'']], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] claimed that he acted according to the oath. His action was challenged in court and overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court in [[Maryland]] (led by Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]]) in ''[[Ex parte Merryman|Ex Parte Merryman]]'', 17 F. Cas. 144 (C.C.D. Md. 1861). Lincoln ignored Taney's order.  Finally, [[Andrew Johnson]]'s counsel referred to the theory during his impeachment [[Trial#Other kinds of trials|trial]]. Otherwise, few have seriously asserted that the oath augments the president's powers.\n\nThe vice president also has an oath of office, but it is not mandated by the Constitution and is prescribed by statute.

Nevertheless, the power of the president to initiate hostilities has been subject to question. According to historian [[Thomas Woods]], \"Ever since the [[Korean War]], Article II, Section 2 [...] has been interpreted 'The president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting Congress' [....] But what the framers actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared, it was the president\u2019s responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war. Alexander Hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have \"the direction of war when authorized or begun.\" The president acting alone was authorized only to repel sudden attacks (hence the decision to withhold from him only the power to \"declare\" war, not to \"make\" war, which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack).<ref>[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Thomas]] (July 7, 2005) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods45.html Presidential War Powers], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.libertyclassroom.com/warpowers/ | title=Presidential War Powers: The Constitutional Answer | publisher=Liberty Classrooom | year=2013 | accessdate=September 6, 2013 | author=Woods, Thomas}}</ref> Since [[World War II]], every major military action has been technically a U.S. military operation or a U.N. \"[[police action]]\", which are deemed legally legitimate by Congress, and various [[United Nations Resolution]]s because of decisions such as the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] or the [[Iraq Resolution|Resolution of The Congress Providing Authorization for Use of Force In Iraq]].\n\nThe president may require the \"principal officer\" of any executive department to tender his advice in writing. While the Constitution nowhere requires a formal [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], it does authorize the president to seek advice from the principal officers of the various departments as he (or she) performs their official duties. George Washington found it prudent to organize his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Presidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government to President Abraham Lincoln, but was rebuffed. Later, Woodrow Wilson advocated use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet while he was a professor, but as president he would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven subcabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gaziano|first1=Todd|title=Essays on Article II: Opinion Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/88/opinion-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\n[[Pardon|Pardons]] and reprieves may be granted by the president, except in cases of [[impeachment]]. There is currently no universally accepted interpretation of the impeachment exception. Some argue that the president simply cannot use a pardon to stop an officeholder from being impeached, while others suggest that crimes underlying an impeachment cannot be pardoned by the president. <ref>Martin H. Redish, [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/impeachment-pardon-power.html \"The President\u2019s Pardon Power May Be Weaker Than It Seems\"], ''The New York Times'', Dec. 5, 2019, Accessed 12/16/2019</ref>\n\nAs ruled by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Wilson]]'' (1833), the pardon could be rejected by the convict. Then, in ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'' (1915), the court specifically said, \"Circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the penalties of the law. If so brought, escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected, preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged transgressor, preferring death even to such certain infamy.\"\n\nCommutations (reduction in prison sentence), unlike pardons (restoration of civil rights after prison sentence had been served) may not be refused. In ''[[Biddle v. Perovich]]'' {{ussc|274|480|1927}}, the subject of the commutation did not want to accept life in prison but wanted the death penalty restored. The Supreme court said, \"[a] pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.\"<ref>''Biddle'', at 486</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause===\nThe president exercises the powers in the Advice and Consent Clause with the [[advice and consent]] of the Senate.\n\n{{quote|He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.}}\n\n====Treaties====\n{{Main|Treaty Clause}}\n\nThe president may enter the United States into treaties, but they are not effective until approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Treaties.htm | title =Treaties | author =''[[United States Senate]]'' | publisher =senate.gov}}</ref> In Article II however, the Constitution is not very explicit about the termination of treaties.

A Senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the president to terminate treaties after being authorized by the Senate alone, and not the entire Congress. President Pierce's successors, however, returned to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both Houses. Some presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of terminating treaties. The first unambiguous case of a president terminating a treaty without authorization, granted prior to or after the termination, occurred when [[Jimmy Carter]] terminated a treaty with the [[Republic of China]].<ref>''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', {{ussc|444|996|1979}}</ref> For the first time, judicial determination was sought, but the effort proved futile: the Supreme Court could not find a majority agreeing on any particular principle, and therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.\n\n====Appointments====\n{{Main|Appointments Clause}}\n\nThe president may also appoint judges, ambassadors, consuls, ministers and other officers with the advice and consent of the Senate. By law, however, Congress may allow the president, heads of executive departments, or the courts to appoint inferior officials.\n\nThe Senate has a long-standing practice of permitting motions to reconsider previous decisions. In 1931, the Senate granted advice and consent to the president on the appointment of a member of the [[Federal Power Commission]]. The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate, under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the advice and consent. In the [[quo warranto|writ of quo warranto]] proceedings that followed, the Supreme Court ruled that the Senate was not permitted to rescind advice and consent after the officer had been installed.\n\nAfter the Senate grants advice and consent, however, the president is under no compulsion to commission the officer. It has not been settled whether the president has the prerogative to withhold a commission after having signed it. This issue played a large part in the seminal court case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.\n\nAt times the president has asserted the power to remove individuals from office. Congress has often explicitly limited the president's power to remove; during the [[Reconstruction Era]], Congress passed the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], purportedly preventing Andrew Johnson from removing, without the advice and consent of the Senate, anyone appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. President Johnson ignored the Act, and was later impeached and acquitted. The constitutionality of the Act was not immediately settled. In ''[[Myers v. United States]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Myers v. United States|272|52|1926}}.</ref> the Supreme Court held that Congress could not limit the president's power to remove an executive officer (the [[Postmaster General]]), but in ''[[Humphrey's Executor v. United States]]'', it upheld Congress's authority to restrict the president's power to remove officers of the [[Federal Trade Commission]], an \"administrative body [that] cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive.\"<ref>{{ussc|name=Humphrey's Executor v. United States|link=|volume=295|page=602|pin=628|year=1935}}. {{usgovpd}}</ref>\n\nCongress may repeal the legislation that authorizes the appointment of an executive officer.

[[Thomas Jefferson]], who felt that the procedure resembled the [[speech from the throne]] delivered by British monarchs, chose instead to send written messages to Congress for reading by clerks. Jefferson's procedure was followed by future presidents until [[Woodrow Wilson]] reverted to the former procedure of personally addressing Congress, which has continued {{As of|2008|alt=to this day}}.<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/>\n\nKesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the State of the Union clause:\n<blockquote>The State of the Union Clause imposes an executive duty on the president. That duty must be discharged periodically. The president's assessment of the State of the Union must be publicized to Congress, and thus to the nation. The publication of the president's assessment conveys information to Congress\u2014information uniquely gleaned from the president's perspective in his various roles as commander-in-chief, chief law enforcer, negotiator with foreign powers, and the like\u2014that shall aid the legislature in public deliberation on matters that may justify the enactment of legislation because of their national importance.<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/></blockquote>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Making recommendations to Congress===\nThe president has the power and duty<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/> to recommend, for the consideration of Congress, such measures which the president deems as \"necessary and expedient\". At [[First inauguration of George Washington|his inauguration]] [[George Washington]] declared in his [[s:George Washington's First Inaugural Address|Inaugural Address]]: \"By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president 'to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'\" This is the Recommendation Clause.<ref name=\"SidakRecClause\">{{cite journal|last=Sidak|first=Gregory|title=The Recommendation Clause|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|date=August 1989|volume=77|issue=6|pages=2079\u20132135|ssrn=296114|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nKesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the Recommendation Clause:\n\n<blockquote>The Recommendation Clause also imposes an executive duty on the president. His recommendations respect the equal dignity of Congress and thus embody the anti-royalty sentiment that ignited the American Revolution and subsequently stripped the trappings of monarchy away from the new chief executive. Through his recommendations to Congress, the president speaks collectively for the People as they petition Government for a redress of grievances, and thus his recommendations embody popular sovereignty. The president tailors his recommendations so that their natural implication is the enactment of new legislation, rather than some other action that Congress might undertake. Finally, the president shall have executive discretion to recommend measures of his choosing.<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/></blockquote>\n\nSidak explained that there is a connection between the Recommendation Clause and the [[Petition Clause]] of the 1st Amendment: \"Through his performance of the duty to recommend measures to Congress, the president functions as the agent of a diffuse electorate who seek the redress of grievances. To muzzle the president, therefore, is to diminish the effectiveness of this right expressly reserved to the people under the first amendment.\"<ref name=\"SidakRecClause\"/>{{rp|2119, note 7}} Kesavan and Sidak also cited a Professor Bybee who stated in this context: \"The Recommendation Clause empowers the president to represent the people before Congress, by recommending measures for the reform of government, for the general welfare, or for the redress of grievances. The Right of Petition Clause prevents Congress from abridging the right of the people to petition for a redress of grievances.\"<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/>{{rp|43}}\n\nThe Recommendation clause imposes a duty, but its performance rests solely with the president. Congress possesses no power to compel the president to recommend, as he alone is the \"judge\" of what is \"necessary and expedient.\" Unlike the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] of Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers, the phrase \"necessary and expedient\" implies a wider range of discretion for the president. Because this is a political question, there has been little judicial involvement with the president's actions under the clause as long as presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers. In ''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations Clause serves as a reminder that the president cannot make law by himself: \"The power to recommend legislation, granted to the president, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate.\"<ref name=\"HFDKesavan20121027\">{{cite web|last=Kesavan|first=Vasan|title=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution: Recommendations Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/95/recommendations-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref> The Court made a similar point in striking down the [[line-item veto]] in ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"HFDKesavan20121027\"/> When President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform as essential to his functions under the Recommendations Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in Ass'n of American Physicians & Surgeons v. Clinton (1993): \"[T]he Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The president has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for that matter, any subject.\"<ref name=\"HFDKesavan20121027\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Convening and adjourning of Congress===\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered to call a [[special session]] of one or both houses of Congress. Since [[John Adams]] first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. [[Harry Truman]] was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so called \"[[Turnip Day Session]]\"). Additionally, prior to ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] (which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January) in 1933, newly [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. Article II, Section 3, Clause 3 also authorizes the president to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power.<ref>{{cite web| last=Forte| first=David F.| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/96/convening-of-congress| title=Essays on Article II: Convening of Congress| work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=Heritage Foundation| accessdate=April 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| title=Congressional Special Sessions| last=Steinmetz| first=Katy| date=August 10, 2010| url=http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,2009480,00.html| magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 4|Reception Clause}}Clause 4: Receiving foreign representatives===\nThe president receives all foreign ambassadors.

Section 1 also establishes the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], the body charged with electing the president and the vice president. Section 1 provides that each state chooses members of the Electoral College in a manner directed by each state's respective legislature, with the states granted electors equal to their combined representation in both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Section 1 lays out the procedures of the Electoral College and requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to hold a [[contingent election]] to select the president if no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote. Section 1 also sets forth the eligibility requirements for the office of the president, provides procedures in case of a presidential vacancy, and requires the president to take an [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]].\n\nSection 2 of Article Two lays out '''the powers of the presidency''', establishing that the president serves as the commander-in-chief of the military, among many other roles. This section gives the president the power to grant [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardons]]. \n\nSection 2 also requires the \"principal officer\" of any executive department to tender advice. Though not required by Article Two, President [[George Washington]] organized the principal officers of the executive departments into the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]], a practice that subsequent presidents have followed. The [[Treaty Clause]] grants the president the power to enter into treaties with the approval of two-thirds of the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The [[Appointments Clause]] grants the president the power to appoint judges and public officials subject to the [[advice and consent]] of the Senate, which in practice has meant that presidential appointees must be [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|confirmed]] by a majority vote in the Senate. The Appointments Clause also establishes that Congress can, by law, allow the president, the courts, or the heads of departments to appoint \"inferior officers\" without requiring the advice and consent of the Senate. The final clause of Section 2 grants the president the power to make [[recess appointment]]s to fill vacancies that occur when the Senate is in recess.\n\nSection 3 of Article Two lays out the responsibilities of the president, granting the president the power to convene both houses of Congress, receive foreign representatives, and commission all federal officers. Section 3 requires the president to inform Congress of the \"state of the union\"; since 1913 this has taken the form of a speech referred to as the [[State of the Union]]. The Recommendation Clause requires the president to recommend measures s/he deems \"necessary and expedient.\" The Take Care Clause requires the president to obey and enforce all laws, though the president retains some discretion in interpreting the laws and determining how to enforce them. Section 4 of Article Two establishes that the president and other officers can be removed from office through the [[impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] process, which is further described in Article One.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: President and vice president==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Executive Power===\n{{quote|The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.

Similar clauses are found in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]]; the former bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the Supreme Court, and other federal courts established by law.<ref>{{cite web| title=Vesting Clause Law and Legal Definition| url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/v/vesting-clause/| website=uslegal.com| publisher=USLegal| accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref> These three articles together secure a [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and individually, each one entrenches [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] on the operation and power of the other two branches.<ref>{{cite web| last=Monk| first=Linda R.| title=We the People| url=http://www.pbs.org/tpt/constitution-usa-peter-sagal/we-the-people/#.Xdq-825FxPY| work=Constitution USA with Peter Segal| publisher=PBS| accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nArticle I grants [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|certain powers]] to Congress, and the Vesting Clause does not reassign those powers to the President. In fact, because those actions require legislation passed by Congress which must be signed by the president to take effect, those powers are not strictly executive powers granted to or retained by Congress per se. Nor were they retained by the U.S. Congress as leftovers from the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Confederation, Continental Congress and its powers were abolished at the time the new U.S. Congress was seated and the new federal government formally and officially replaced its interim predecessor. And although the president is implicitly denied the power to unilaterally declare war, a declaration of war is not in and of itself a vehicle of executive power since it is literally just a public declaration that the U.S. government considers itself \"at war\" with a foreign political entity.\n\nRegardless of the inability to declare war, the president does have the power to unilaterally order military action in defense of the United States pursuant to \"a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces\". By U.S. law, this power is limited in that he must notify Congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations, explaining the source of his authority for the action. Once proper legal notification is given to the required members of Congress, military action can continue for up to 60 days without further authorization from Congress, or up to 90 days if the president \"determines and certifies to the Congress in writing that unavoidable military necessity respecting the safety of United States Armed Forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp | title= War Powers Resolution|publisher=Avalon Project }}</ref>\n\nAs treaties are by U.S. law official agreements with foreign governments recognized as such only after Senate ratification, the president obviously cannot make treaties unilaterally. However, the president does determine and decide U.S. foreign policy, and can enter into non-binding discussions and give conditional approval to agreements reached with foreign governments subject to Senate ratification at a future date.\n\nAdditionally, since official treaties are specifically created under and by constitutional U.S. law, and are entered into by both government and the people as a whole, in their capacity as head of state and as the single individual representative of the United States and its citizens, the president does have Coauthority and Constitutional duty to unilaterally withdraw the United States from treaties if he or she determines the best interests and well being of the U.S. and its citizens are benefited by doing so.\n\nAs far as presidential appointments, as with treaties a person is not officially and legally appointed to a position until their appointment is approved by the Senate. Prior to Senate approval and publication of that approval along with an official date and time for their swearing-in and assumption of duties and responsibilities, they are nominees rather than appointees. And again, the president nominates people for specific positions at their pleasure and can do so without or in spite of Senate advice. Senate consent occurs when a majority of senators votes to approve and therefore appoint a nominee.\n\nThe head of the Executive Branch is the president. Although also named in this first clause, the vice president is not constitutionally vested with any executive power. Nonetheless, the Constitution dictates that the president and vice president are to be elected at the same time, for the same term, and by the same constituency. The framers' intent was to preserve the independence of the executive branch should the person who was vice president succeed to the duties of the presidency.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-ii| title=Article Two: Executive Branch| website=constitutioncenter.org| publisher=National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=November 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Method of choosing electors===\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution the president and vice president are chosen by [[Electoral College (United States)|electors]], under a constitutional grant of authority delegated to the legislatures of the several states.  The Constitution reserves the choice of the precise manner for creating electors to the will of the state legislatures. It does not define or delimit what process a state legislature may use to create its ''state'' college of electors.  In practice, the state legislatures have generally chosen to create electors through an indirect popular vote, since the 1820s. Most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system in which the candidate with the most votes in the state gets all the electoral votes.<ref name=\"ncsl.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-electoral-college.aspx |title=The Electoral College|website=ncsl.org|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref> Maine and Nebraska allow individual congressional districts to elect one elector.\n\nIn an indirect popular vote, it is the names of the candidates who are on the ballot to be elected.

The actual electors being voted for are usually selected by the candidate's party.  There are a few cases where some electors have refused to vote for the designated candidate.  (See \"Faithless Elector\".) Many states have mandated in law that electors ''shall'' cast their electoral college ballot for the designated presidential candidate.<ref name=\"ncsl.org\"/> The constitutionality of such mandates is uncertain.<ref name=\"nyt-USCA\">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Trip |title=Electoral College Members Can Defy Voters\u2019 Wishes, Court Rules |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/politics/electoral-college-faithless-elector.html |accessdate=23 August 2019 |publisher=NY Times |date=22 Aug 2019}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nEach state chooses as many electors as it has representatives and senators representing it in Congress. Under the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]], the [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] may choose no more electors than the state with the lowest number of electoral votes (in effect, three electors), although since that amendment's ratification the District's population has never reached the threshold that would otherwise entitle it to choose four or more electors. U.S. senators, representatives and federal government officials are barred from becoming electors; in practice, the two major federal parties frequently select senior state party and government officials (up to and including governors) to serve as electors.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Electors===\n{{quote|The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.

Once chosen, the electors meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the president and vice president. Originally, each elector cast two votes for president; at least one of the individuals voted for had to be from a state different from the elector's. The individual with the majority of votes became president, and the runner-up became vice president. In case of a tie between candidates who received votes from a majority of electors, the House of Representatives would choose one of the tied candidates; if no person received a majority, then the House could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes. When the House voted, each state delegation cast one vote, and the vote of a majority of states was necessary to choose a president. If second-place candidates were tied, then the Senate broke the tie. A quorum in the House consisted of at least one member from two-thirds of the state delegations; there was no special quorum for the Senate. This procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie, and nearly resulted in a [[1800 United States presidential election#Contingent election|deadlock in the House]].\n\nWhile the Constitution reflects the Framers' clear preference for the president to be elected by a constituency independent of the Congress, one of the most palpable limitations created by the stipulation that electors meet in their respective states as opposed to a single venue was that given the constraints of eighteenth-century technology there was no practical means for that constituency to resolve deadlocked elections in a timely manner, thus necessitating the involvement of Congress in resolving deadlocked elections. Obviously, having the electors meet in the national capital or some other single venue could have permitted the electors to choose a president by means of an [[exhaustive ballot]] without Congressional involvement, but the Framers were dissuaded from such an arrangement by two major considerations. First, it would have been quite burdensome for electors from distant states to travel to the national capital using eighteenth century means for the sole purpose of electing the president \u2013 since they were to be barred from simultaneously serving in the federal government in any other capacity, electors would likely have no other reason to go there. But probably even more importantly, many Framers genuinely feared that if the electors met in a single venue, especially under the initial assumption that they would [[unpledged elector|act independently]] as opposed to being bound to vote for particular candidates, they would be vulnerable to the influence of mobs who might try to ensure a particular result by means of threats and intimidation \u2013 this had been a fairly common occurrence in European elections for powerful officials by relatively small constituencies (for example, and perhaps in particular, in [[papal election]]s) from the Middle Ages up to the Constitution's creation.\n\nThe 12th Amendment introduced a number of important changes to the procedure. Now, electors do not cast two votes for president; rather, they cast one vote for president and another for vice president. In case no presidential candidate receives a majority, the House chooses from the top three (not five, as before the 12th Amendment). The Amendment also requires the Senate to choose the vice president from those with the two highest figures if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes (rather than only if there's a tie for second for president).  It also stipulates that to be the vice president, a person must be qualified to be the president.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Election day===\n[[File:A certificate for the electoral vote for Rutherford B.

When [[William Henry Harrison]] died in office, a debate arose over whether the vice president would become president, or if he would just inherit the powers, thus becoming an acting president. Harrison's vice president, [[John Tyler]], believed that he had the right to become president. However, many senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler took the Oath of Office as president, setting a precedent that made it possible for later vice presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the president's death. The \"Tyler Precedent\" established that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president.\n\nThe Congress may provide for a [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]] beyond the vice president. The current [[Presidential Succession Act]] establishes the order as the speaker of the House of Representatives, the president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate and then the fifteen Cabinet secretaries in order of each department's establishment. There are concerns regarding the constitutionality of having members of Congress in the line of succession, however, as this clause specifies that only an \"[[officer of the United States]]\" may be designated as a presidential successor. Constitutional scholars from [[James Madison]] to the present day have argued that the term \"officer\" excludes members of Congress.\n\nThe [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] explicitly states that if the president dies, resigns or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president, and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president. The Amendment further provides that the president, or the vice president and Cabinet, can declare the president unable to discharge his duties, in which case the vice president becomes Acting president. If the declaration is done by the vice president and Cabinet, the Amendment permits the president to take control back, unless the vice president and Cabinet challenge the president and two-thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the vice president and Cabinet. If the declaration is done by the president, he may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 1, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Salary===\n{{Redirect|Domestic Emoluments Clause||Emoluments Clause (disambiguation){{!}}Emoluments Clause}}\n{{See also|President of the United States#Compensation}}\n\n{{quote|The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.}}\n\nThe president's salary, currently $400,000 a year,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/102|title=3 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f102.

In suspending the privilege of the [[habeas corpus|writ of ''habeas corpus'']], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] claimed that he acted according to the oath. His action was challenged in court and overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court in [[Maryland]] (led by Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]]) in ''[[Ex parte Merryman|Ex Parte Merryman]]'', 17 F. Cas. 144 (C.C.D. Md. 1861). Lincoln ignored Taney's order.  Finally, [[Andrew Johnson]]'s counsel referred to the theory during his impeachment [[Trial#Other kinds of trials|trial]].

Nevertheless, the power of the president to initiate hostilities has been subject to question. According to historian [[Thomas Woods]], \"Ever since the [[Korean War]], Article II, Section 2 [...] has been interpreted 'The president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting Congress' [....] But what the framers actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared, it was the president\u2019s responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war. Alexander Hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have \"the direction of war when authorized or begun.\" The president acting alone was authorized only to repel sudden attacks (hence the decision to withhold from him only the power to \"declare\" war, not to \"make\" war, which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack).<ref>[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Thomas]] (July 7, 2005) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods45.html Presidential War Powers], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.libertyclassroom.com/warpowers/ | title=Presidential War Powers: The Constitutional Answer | publisher=Liberty Classrooom | year=2013 | accessdate=September 6, 2013 | author=Woods, Thomas}}</ref> Since [[World War II]], every major military action has been technically a U.S. military operation or a U.N. \"[[police action]]\", which are deemed legally legitimate by Congress, and various [[United Nations Resolution]]s because of decisions such as the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] or the [[Iraq Resolution|Resolution of The Congress Providing Authorization for Use of Force In Iraq]].\n\nThe president may require the \"principal officer\" of any executive department to tender his advice in writing. While the Constitution nowhere requires a formal [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]], it does authorize the president to seek advice from the principal officers of the various departments as he (or she) performs their official duties. George Washington found it prudent to organize his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Presidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government to President Abraham Lincoln, but was rebuffed. Later, Woodrow Wilson advocated use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet while he was a professor, but as president he would have none of it in his administration. In recent administrations, cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven subcabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gaziano|first1=Todd|title=Essays on Article II: Opinion Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/88/opinion-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\n[[Pardon|Pardons]] and reprieves may be granted by the president, except in cases of [[impeachment]]. There is currently no universally accepted interpretation of the impeachment exception. Some argue that the president simply cannot use a pardon to stop an officeholder from being impeached, while others suggest that crimes underlying an impeachment cannot be pardoned by the president. <ref>Martin H. Redish, [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/opinion/impeachment-pardon-power.html \"The President\u2019s Pardon Power May Be Weaker Than It Seems\"], ''The New York Times'', Dec. 5, 2019, Accessed 12/16/2019</ref>\n\nAs ruled by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Wilson]]'' (1833), the pardon could be rejected by the convict. Then, in ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'' (1915), the court specifically said, \"Circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the penalties of the law. If so brought, escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected, preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged transgressor, preferring death even to such certain infamy.\"\n\nCommutations (reduction in prison sentence), unlike pardons (restoration of civil rights after prison sentence had been served) may not be refused. In ''[[Biddle v. Perovich]]'' {{ussc|274|480|1927}}, the subject of the commutation did not want to accept life in prison but wanted the death penalty restored. The Supreme court said, \"[a] pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power. It is a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.\"<ref>''Biddle'', at 486</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Advice and Consent Clause===\nThe president exercises the powers in the Advice and Consent Clause with the [[advice and consent]] of the Senate.\n\n{{quote|He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.}}\n\n====Treaties====\n{{Main|Treaty Clause}}\n\nThe president may enter the United States into treaties, but they are not effective until approved by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Treaties.htm | title =Treaties | author =''[[United States Senate]]'' | publisher =senate.gov}}</ref> In Article II however, the Constitution is not very explicit about the termination of treaties.

A Senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the president to terminate treaties after being authorized by the Senate alone, and not the entire Congress. President Pierce's successors, however, returned to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both Houses. Some presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of terminating treaties. The first unambiguous case of a president terminating a treaty without authorization, granted prior to or after the termination, occurred when [[Jimmy Carter]] terminated a treaty with the [[Republic of China]].<ref>''[[Goldwater v. Carter]]'', {{ussc|444|996|1979}}</ref> For the first time, judicial determination was sought, but the effort proved futile: the Supreme Court could not find a majority agreeing on any particular principle, and therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case.\n\n====Appointments====\n{{Main|Appointments Clause}}\n\nThe president may also appoint judges, ambassadors, consuls, ministers and other officers with the advice and consent of the Senate. By law, however, Congress may allow the president, heads of executive departments, or the courts to appoint inferior officials.\n\nThe Senate has a long-standing practice of permitting motions to reconsider previous decisions. In 1931, the Senate granted advice and consent to the president on the appointment of a member of the [[Federal Power Commission]]. The officer in question was sworn in, but the Senate, under the guise of a motion to reconsider, rescinded the advice and consent. In the [[quo warranto|writ of quo warranto]] proceedings that followed, the Supreme Court ruled that the Senate was not permitted to rescind advice and consent after the officer had been installed.\n\nAfter the Senate grants advice and consent, however, the president is under no compulsion to commission the officer. It has not been settled whether the president has the prerogative to withhold a commission after having signed it. This issue played a large part in the seminal court case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.\n\nAt times the president has asserted the power to remove individuals from office. Congress has often explicitly limited the president's power to remove; during the [[Reconstruction Era]], Congress passed the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], purportedly preventing Andrew Johnson from removing, without the advice and consent of the Senate, anyone appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. President Johnson ignored the Act, and was later impeached and acquitted. The constitutionality of the Act was not immediately settled. In ''[[Myers v. United States]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Myers v. United States|272|52|1926}}.</ref> the Supreme Court held that Congress could not limit the president's power to remove an executive officer (the [[Postmaster General]]), but in ''[[Humphrey's Executor v. United States]]'', it upheld Congress's authority to restrict the president's power to remove officers of the [[Federal Trade Commission]], an \"administrative body [that] cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive.\"<ref>{{ussc|name=Humphrey's Executor v. United States|link=|volume=295|page=602|pin=628|year=1935}}. {{usgovpd}}</ref>\n\nCongress may repeal the legislation that authorizes the appointment of an executive officer.

[[Thomas Jefferson]], who felt that the procedure resembled the [[speech from the throne]] delivered by British monarchs, chose instead to send written messages to Congress for reading by clerks.

That duty must be discharged periodically. The president's assessment of the State of the Union must be publicized to Congress, and thus to the nation. The publication of the president's assessment conveys information to Congress\u2014information uniquely gleaned from the president's perspective in his various roles as commander-in-chief, chief law enforcer, negotiator with foreign powers, and the like\u2014that shall aid the legislature in public deliberation on matters that may justify the enactment of legislation because of their national importance.<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/></blockquote>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Making recommendations to Congress===\nThe president has the power and duty<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/> to recommend, for the consideration of Congress, such measures which the president deems as \"necessary and expedient\". At [[First inauguration of George Washington|his inauguration]] [[George Washington]] declared in his [[s:George Washington's First Inaugural Address|Inaugural Address]]: \"By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president 'to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'\" This is the Recommendation Clause.<ref name=\"SidakRecClause\">{{cite journal|last=Sidak|first=Gregory|title=The Recommendation Clause|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|date=August 1989|volume=77|issue=6|pages=2079\u20132135|ssrn=296114|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nKesavan and Sidak explain the purpose of the Recommendation Clause:\n\n<blockquote>The Recommendation Clause also imposes an executive duty on the president. His recommendations respect the equal dignity of Congress and thus embody the anti-royalty sentiment that ignited the American Revolution and subsequently stripped the trappings of monarchy away from the new chief executive. Through his recommendations to Congress, the president speaks collectively for the People as they petition Government for a redress of grievances, and thus his recommendations embody popular sovereignty. The president tailors his recommendations so that their natural implication is the enactment of new legislation, rather than some other action that Congress might undertake. Finally, the president shall have executive discretion to recommend measures of his choosing.<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/></blockquote>\n\nSidak explained that there is a connection between the Recommendation Clause and the [[Petition Clause]] of the 1st Amendment: \"Through his performance of the duty to recommend measures to Congress, the president functions as the agent of a diffuse electorate who seek the redress of grievances. To muzzle the president, therefore, is to diminish the effectiveness of this right expressly reserved to the people under the first amendment.\"<ref name=\"SidakRecClause\"/>{{rp|2119, note 7}} Kesavan and Sidak also cited a Professor Bybee who stated in this context: \"The Recommendation Clause empowers the president to represent the people before Congress, by recommending measures for the reform of government, for the general welfare, or for the redress of grievances. The Right of Petition Clause prevents Congress from abridging the right of the people to petition for a redress of grievances.\"<ref name=\"KesavanSidak\"/>{{rp|43}}\n\nThe Recommendation clause imposes a duty, but its performance rests solely with the president. Congress possesses no power to compel the president to recommend, as he alone is the \"judge\" of what is \"necessary and expedient.\" Unlike the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] of Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers, the phrase \"necessary and expedient\" implies a wider range of discretion for the president. Because this is a political question, there has been little judicial involvement with the president's actions under the clause as long as presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers. In ''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations Clause serves as a reminder that the president cannot make law by himself: \"The power to recommend legislation, granted to the president, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate.\"<ref name=\"HFDKesavan20121027\">{{cite web|last=Kesavan|first=Vasan|title=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution: Recommendations Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/95/recommendations-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref> The Court made a similar point in striking down the [[line-item veto]] in ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"HFDKesavan20121027\"/> When President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform as essential to his functions under the Recommendations Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in Ass'n of American Physicians & Surgeons v. Clinton (1993): \"[T]he Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The president has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for that matter, any subject.\"<ref name=\"HFDKesavan20121027\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Convening and adjourning of Congress===\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered to call a [[special session]] of one or both houses of Congress. Since [[John Adams]] first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. [[Harry Truman]] was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so called \"[[Turnip Day Session]]\"). Additionally, prior to ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] (which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January) in 1933, newly [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties.

Roosevelt]] and his successors sometimes refused outright to expend appropriated money.<ref name=\"THF20121012\"/> The Supreme Court, however, has held that impoundments without Congressional authorization are unconstitutional.<ref name=Prakash>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution#!/articles/2/essays/98/take-care-clause|title=Take Care Clause|author=Sai Prakash|work=The Heritage Guide to the Constitution|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt has been asserted that the president's responsibility in the \"faithful\" execution of the laws entitles him to suspend the privilege of the [[habeas corpus|writ of ''habeas corpus'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lincolngroup.org/documents/lincoln-s-suspension-of-the-writ-of-habeas-corpus.pdf|title=Lincoln's Suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus: An Historical and Constitutional Analysis|last=Dueholm|first=James A.|date=2008|publisher=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |volume=29|issue=2|page=48|website= lincolngroup.org |access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref> Article One provides that the privilege may not be suspended save during times of rebellion or invasion, but it does not specify who may suspend the privilege.

Johnson]]'', {{ussc|71|475|1867}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the judiciary may not restrain the president in the execution of the laws. In that case the Supreme Court refused to entertain a request for an injunction preventing President Andrew Johnson from executing the [[Reconstruction Acts]], which were claimed to be unconstitutional. The Court found that \"[t]he Congress is the legislative department of the government; the president is the executive department. Neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial department; though the acts of both, when performed, are, in proper cases, subject to its cognizance.\"<ref>''Johnson'', at 500</ref> Thus, the courts cannot bar the passage of a law by Congress, though it may later strike down such a law as unconstitutional. A similar construction applies to the executive branch.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 6}}Clause 6: Officers' commissions===\nThe president commissions \"all the Officers of the United States.\" These include officers in both military and foreign service. (Under Article I, Section 8, the States have authority for \"the Appointment of the Officers . . . of the [State] [[Militia (United States)|Militia]] . . ..\")\n\nThe presidential authority to commission officers had a large impact on the 1803 case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', where outgoing Federalist President [[John Adams]] feverishly signed many commissions to the judiciary on his final day in office, hoping to, as incoming Democratic-Republican President [[Thomas Jefferson]] put it, \"[retire] into the judiciary as a stronghold.\" However, in his haste, Adams' secretary of State neglected to have all the commissions delivered. Incoming President Jefferson was enraged with Adams, and ordered his [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of State]], [[James Madison]], to refrain from delivering the remaining commissions. [[William Marbury]] took the matter to the Supreme Court, where the famous ''Marbury'' was decided. <!--So how did it rule? Were the commissions valid or not? -->\n\n{{anchor|Section 4}}\n==Section 4: Impeachment==\n[[File:Andrew Johnson impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|300px|Depiction of the impeachment trial of President [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1868, with [[Salmon P.

It is a form of the [[Old French language|Old French]] name ''Alis'' (older ''Alais''), short form of ''[[Adelais]]'', which is derivation from the Germanic name ''Adalhaidis'' (see [[Adelaide (given name)|Adelaide]]), from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] words {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*a\u00fealaz|*a\u00feala-}}, meaning \"noble\" and {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*haidu-}}, meaning \"appearance; kind\" (compare German ''[[Adel (name)|Adel]]'' \"nobility\", ''edel'' \"noble\", nominalizing suffix ''-heit'' \"-hood\"), hence \"of noble character or rank, of nobility\".

It has been popularized by ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', by [[Lewis Carroll]]. It was also popular in the [[Victorian era]] due to [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|The Princess Alice]], a daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. In the US, [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]], daughter of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was occasionally known as \"Princess Alice\" in the press and inspired a song called ''[[Alice Blue Gown]].'' In recent years in the US, the variants ''[[Alicia (given name)|Alicia]]'', ''[[Alison (given name)|Alison]]'', and a short form, ''[[Allie]]'', have been more popular names: in 2010, Alison was the 38th most popular; Alicia was the 220th most popular, and Allie was the 189th most popular. All three names have multiple spelling variants which are also well-used. ''[[Alyssa]]'', the 20th most popular in 2010, may sound like a variant, but it is historically of different origin, from the flower [[alyssum]].\n\nLike Adelaide, Alice's [[name day]] is [[16 December]], for [[Adelaide of Italy]].\n\n== People ==\n\n=== Royalty ===\n* [[Alice of Antioch]]\n* [[Alice of Cyprus]]\n* [[Alice Heine]], Princess consort of Monaco, wife of Albert I of Monaco\n* [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]]; longest-lived Princess of The Blood Royal of the United Kingdom\n* [[Princess Alice of Battenberg]]\n* [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine; third child and second daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]\n\n=== Authors and poets ===\n* [[Alice Adams (writer)|Alice Adams]], American author\n* [[Alice Albinia]], author\n*[[Alice Birch]], British playwright and screenwriter\n* [[Alice Cary]], poet\n* [[Alice Turner Curtis]] (1860-1958), American writer\n* [[Alice Williams Brotherton]] (1848-1930), American writer\n* [[Alice May Douglas]] (1865\u20131943), American poet, author, editor\n* [[Alice Flowerdew]] (1759\u20131830), English teacher, hymnwriter, religious poet\n* [[Alice Fulton]], poet and author\n* [[Alice Greenwood]] (1862\u20131935), British historian, teacher and writer\n* [[Alice Hoffman]], author of ''[[Practical Magic]]''\n* [[Alice Emma Ives]], American dramatist, journalist\n* [[Alice Eleanor Jones]], American science fiction writer and journalist\n* [[Alice MacDonell]], Scottish poet\n* [[Alice Marriott (historian)|Alice Marriott]] (born 1910), American historian\n* [[Alice Moore McComas]] (1850\u20131919), American author, editor, lecturer, reformer\n* [[Alice McDermott]], author\n* [[Alice Duer Miller]], author and poet\n* [[Alice Munro]], Canadian author\n* [[Alice Rivaz]], Swiss author\n* [[Alice Sebold]], author of ''[[The Lovely Bones]]''\n* Alice Sheldon, better known by her pen name [[James Tiptree Jr.]]\n* [[Alice Spigelman]], Hungarian-born Australian clinical psychologist, writer and human rights advocate\n* [[Alice Tawhai]], pen name of a New Zealand fiction writer\n* [[Alice Thompson]], Scottish novelist\n* [[Alice Bellvadore Sams Turner]] (1859\u20131915), American physician, writer\n* [[Alice Voinescu]], Romanian writer\n* [[Alice Walker]], author\n* [[Alice Robinson Boise Wood]] (1846-1919), American classicist and poet\n\n=== Musicians ===\n* [[Alice (Italian singer)|Alice (Visconti, born Carla Bissi)]], Italian singer-songwriter\n* [[Song Joohee|Alice (born Song Joo-hee)]], South Korean singer, a member of [[Hello Venus]]\n* [[Alice Babs]], Swedish singer and actress\n* [[Alice Caymmi]], Brazilian singer\n* [[Alice Coltrane]], jazz pianist\n* [[Alice Cooper]], male rock musician (see also ''[[The Alice Cooper Show]]'' and ''[[Alice Cooper Goes to Hell]]'')\n* [[Alice Coote]], British opera singer\n* [[Alice Deejay]], Dutch dance music artist\n* [[Alice in Chains]], American metal band\n* [[Alice Glass]], vocalist in electronic duo [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]]\n* [[Alice Nutter (musician)]], a member of the British music band [[Chumbawamba]]\n* [[Alice Prin]], singer and actress\n* [[Alice Mary Smith]], English composer\n* [[Alice Spooner]], keyboardist in English [[grime (music)|Grime]]/[[New Rave]] band [[Hadouken!]]\n* [[Alice Thompson (musician)|Alice Thompson]], pianist and composer\n\n=== Actresses and filmmakers ===\n* [[Alice Barrett]], actress\n* [[Alice Bellagamba]], Italian actress and dancer\n* [[Alice Brady]], American actress\n* [[Alice Calhoun]], American silent film actress\n* [[Alice Coc\u00e9a]], French actress\n* [[Alice Connor]], British actress\n* [[Alice Davenport]], American actress\n* [[Alice Day]], American actress\n* [[Alice Dovey]], American stage actress\n* [[Alice Evans]], British-American actress\n* [[Alice Eve]], English actress\n* [[Alice Faye]], actress and singer\n* [[Alice Gale]], American actress\n* [[Alice Greczyn]], American actress\n* [[Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9]], French filmmaker\n* [[Alice Hollister]], American actress\n* [[Alice Howell]], American actress\n* [[Alice Joyce]], American silent film actress\n* [[Alice Krige]], South African actress\n* [[Alice Lake]], American actress\n* [[Alice Lowe]], actress\n* [[Ali MacGraw]], actress; birth name is Elizabeth Alice\n* [[Alice Mann]], American actress\n* [[Alice Marriott (actress)|Alice Marriott]] (1824-1900), English actress\n* [[Alice Moran]], Canadian actress\n* [[Alice Pearce]], actress\n* [[Alice Ripley]], American actress\n* [[Alice Robitaille]], Canadian actress\n* [[Alice B.

In the US, [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]], daughter of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was occasionally known as \"Princess Alice\" in the press and inspired a song called ''[[Alice Blue Gown]].'' In recent years in the US, the variants ''[[Alicia (given name)|Alicia]]'', ''[[Alison (given name)|Alison]]'', and a short form, ''[[Allie]]'', have been more popular names: in 2010, Alison was the 38th most popular; Alicia was the 220th most popular, and Allie was the 189th most popular.

These words are used for any type of journey, e.g. by bus from [[Nairobi]] to [[Mombasa]] or by ferry from [[Dar es Salaam]] to [[Unguja]].

Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.<ref>pp.6-7 Balfour, Daryl &  Balfour, Sharna ''Simply Safari'' Struik, 2001</ref> The hunting aspect traditionally associated with the safari is said to have its origins in the early 1800s in the region of [[\u00c9vora]], [[Alentejo]], where villagers got together to hunt wild [[boar]] and reclaim land for farming. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Literary genre==\n[[Jules Verne]]'s first novel ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' published in 1863 and [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s first novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' published in 1885, both describe journeys of English travellers on Safari and were best sellers in their day. These two books gave rise to a genre of Safari adventure novels and films.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote several fiction and non-fiction pieces about African safaris. His short stories \"[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]\" and \"[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]\" are set on African safaris and were written after Hemingway's own experience on safari.  His books ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'' and ''[[True at First Light]]'' are both set on African safaris.\n\n==Cinematic genre==\nThe safari provided countless hours of cinema entertainment in sound films from ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'' (1931) onwards. The safari was used in many adventure films such as the [[Tarzan]], [[Jungle Jim]], and [[Bomba the Jungle Boy]] [[film series]] up to ''[[The Naked Prey]]'' (1965) where [[Cornel Wilde]], a [[white hunter]], becomes game himself.

In the past, the trip was often a [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunt]], but today, safaris are often to observe and [[Wildlife photography|photograph wildlife]]\u2014or hiking and sightseeing, as well.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Safari-jam-in-Maasai-Mara.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Lion-watching during a safari in the Maasai Mara]]\n[[File:Serengeti Safari with Leopard.jpg|upright|thumb|A safari in the [[Serengeti National Park]]; Tourists go right under a roadside tree on which a leopard is resting]]\n[[File:KrugerNightSafari.jpg|thumb|right|A night drive in the [[Kruger National Park]] in South Africa]]\nThe [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word ''safari'' means ''journey,'' originally from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] adjective <big>\u0633\u0641\u0631</big> (''safar'') meaning ''a journey,<ref>''[[Hans Wehr]] Arabic-English Dictionary''</ref> travelling'', ''touring'' or ''voyaging''; the verb for \"to travel\" in Swahili is ''kusafiri''. These words are used for any type of journey, e.g. by bus from [[Nairobi]] to [[Mombasa]] or by ferry from [[Dar es Salaam]] to [[Unguja]]. ''Safari'' entered the English language at the end of the 1850s thanks to explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = safari | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/169670?rskey=BnRdiF&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid | website = [[oed.com]] | accessdate = 2 December 2014 }}<br>See also: {{Cite web | title = ''safari'' in English corpus, 1800\u20132000 | url = https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=safari&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=0 | website = [[Google Ngram Viewer]] | accessdate = 2 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Regimental March of the [[King's African Rifles]] was \"Funga Safari\", literally 'set out on a journey', or, in other words, pack up equipment ready for travel. \n\n{{Quote|\n''Funga safari, funga safari.''\n''Funga safari, funga safari.''\n''Amri ya nani?

Harris established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and tobacco.<ref>pp.6-7 Balfour, Daryl &  Balfour, Sharna ''Simply Safari'' Struik, 2001</ref> The hunting aspect traditionally associated with the safari is said to have its origins in the early 1800s in the region of [[\u00c9vora]], [[Alentejo]], where villagers got together to hunt wild [[boar]] and reclaim land for farming. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Literary genre==\n[[Jules Verne]]'s first novel ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' published in 1863 and [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s first novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' published in 1885, both describe journeys of English travellers on Safari and were best sellers in their day. These two books gave rise to a genre of Safari adventure novels and films.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Ernest Hemingway]] wrote several fiction and non-fiction pieces about African safaris. His short stories \"[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]\" and \"[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]\" are set on African safaris and were written after Hemingway's own experience on safari.  His books ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'' and ''[[True at First Light]]'' are both set on African safaris.\n\n==Cinematic genre==\nThe safari provided countless hours of cinema entertainment in sound films from ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'' (1931) onwards. The safari was used in many adventure films such as the [[Tarzan]], [[Jungle Jim]], and [[Bomba the Jungle Boy]] [[film series]] up to ''[[The Naked Prey]]'' (1965) where [[Cornel Wilde]], a [[white hunter]], becomes game himself. The safari genre films were parodied in the [[Bob Hope]] comedies ''[[Road to Zanzibar]]'' and ''[[Call Me Bwana]]''.

SHGs comprise twenty or fewer members, of whom the majority are women from the poorest [[caste]]s and tribes. Members save small amounts of money, as little as a few rupees a month in a group fund. Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities. Banks typically lend up to four rupees for every rupee in the group fund. In Asia borrowers generally pay interest rates that range from 30% to 70% without commission and fees.<ref>Nimal A.

Most nonprofit microlenders include services like financial literacy training and business plan consultations, which contribute to the expense of providing such loans but also, those groups say, to the success of their borrowers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/business/microcredit-for-americans.html|title=Microcredit for Americans|first=Shaila|last=Dewan|date=|website=nytimes.com}}</ref> One such organization in the [[United States of America]], the [[Accion U.S. Network]] is a nonprofit microfinance organization headquartered in New York, NY.

Among these, multiple Internet-based organizations have developed platforms that facilitate a modified form of [[peer-to-peer lending]] where a loan is not made in the form of a single, direct loan, but as the aggregation of a number of smaller loans\u2014often at a negligible interest rate.\n\nExamples of platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs via Internet are [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another WWW-based microlender, [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228000309/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia |date=2010-02-28 }}</ref> [[Vittana]] allows peer-to-peer lending for student loans in developing countries.<ref>Rao.

Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US, UK and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.<ref>Nitin Bhatt, Gary Painter, and Shui-Yan Tang, 1999. \u201cCan Microcredit Work in the United States?\u201d, Harvard Business Review, November-December 1999 Issue.

It has often generated [[self-employment]], but it has not necessarily increased incomes after interest payments. In some cases it has driven borrowers into debt traps.

In short, microcredit has achieved much less than what its proponents said it would achieve, but its negative impacts have not been as drastic as some critics have argued.

The result is that the traditional approach to microcredit has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microcredit loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Borrowers who do not manage to earn a rate of return at least equal to the interest rate may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans. According to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans.<ref>http://centerforfinancialinclusionblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/111108_cfi_over-indebtedness-in-ghana_jessica-schicks_en_final.pdf</ref> In recent years, microcredit providers have shifted their focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably.

There are always people eager to take advantage of the vulnerable.

Yunus saw poverty eradication as being in the hands of the individual.

Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities.

It is the largest and only nationwide nonprofit microfinance network in the U.S.. The Accion U.S. Network is part of Accion International, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization operating globally, with the mission of giving people the financial tools they need to create or grow healthy businesses. The domestic Accion programs started in Brooklyn, NY, and grew from there to become the first nationwide network microlender.<ref>[[Accion U.S. Network]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}} U.S. microcredit programs have helped many poor but ambitious borrowers to improve their lot. The Aspen Institute\u2019s study of 405 microentrepreneurs indicates that more than half of the loan recipients escaped poverty within five years. On average, their household assets grew by nearly $16,000 during that period; the group\u2019s reliance on public assistance dropped by more than 60%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/1999/11/can-microcredit-work-in-the-united-states|title=Can Microcredit Work in the United States?|author=|date=1 November 1999|website=hbr.org}}</ref> Several corporate sponsors including Citi Foundation and Capital One launched Grameen America in New York. Since then the financial outfit \u2013 not bank - has been serving the poor, mainly women, throughout four of the city\u2019s five boroughs (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens) as well as Omaha, Nebraska and Indianapolis, Indiana. In four years, Grameen America has facilitated loans to over 9,000 borrowers valued over $35 million. It has had, as Grameen CEO Stephen Vogel notes, \u201ca 99 percent repayment rate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elmirabayrasli/2012/03/26/microfinance-in-america/#1714c90846e8|title=Microfinance in America?|first=Elmira|last=Bayrasli|date=|website=forbes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Peer-to-peer lending over the Web===\nThe principles of microcredit have also been applied in attempting to address several non-poverty-related issues.  Among these, multiple Internet-based organizations have developed platforms that facilitate a modified form of [[peer-to-peer lending]] where a loan is not made in the form of a single, direct loan, but as the aggregation of a number of smaller loans\u2014often at a negligible interest rate.\n\nExamples of platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs via Internet are [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another WWW-based microlender, [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]], uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. United Prosperity claims this provides both greater leverage and allows the micro-entrepreneur to develop a credit history with their local bank for future loans. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228000309/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia |date=2010-02-28 }}</ref> [[Vittana]] allows peer-to-peer lending for student loans in developing countries.<ref>Rao.

Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US, UK and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.<ref>Nitin Bhatt, Gary Painter, and Shui-Yan Tang, 1999. \u201cCan Microcredit Work in the United States?\u201d, Harvard Business Review, November-December 1999 Issue.

They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education.<ref>Tonelli M. and C.

It has often generated [[self-employment]], but it has not necessarily increased incomes after interest payments. In some cases it has driven borrowers into debt traps. There is no evidence that microcredit has empowered women. In short, microcredit has achieved much less than what its proponents said it would achieve, but its negative impacts have not been as drastic as some critics have argued. Microcredit is just one factor influencing the success of a small businesses, whose success is influenced to a much larger extent by how much an economy or a particular market grows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-01/ifpa-mdl012115.php|title=Microcredit doesn't live up to promise of transforming lives of the poor, 6 studies show|author=|date=|website=EurekAlert!}}</ref>\n\n[[Unintended consequences]] of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?| doi = 10.18356/10695889-en|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103\u2013117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}</ref>\n\n==Improvement==\n[[File:Inside banco palmas woman.JPG|thumb|Many microfinance institutions also offer savings facilities, such as Banco Palma in Brazil shown here.]]\nMany scholars and practitioners suggest an integrated package of services (\"a credit-plus\" approach) rather than just providing credits.

The result is that the traditional approach to microcredit has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microcredit loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Borrowers who do not manage to earn a rate of return at least equal to the interest rate may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans. According to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans.<ref>http://centerforfinancialinclusionblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/111108_cfi_over-indebtedness-in-ghana_jessica-schicks_en_final.pdf</ref> In recent years, microcredit providers have shifted their focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably.  Analyst David Roodman contends that in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref> \n\nProfessor [[Dean Karlan]] from [[Yale University]] advocates also giving the poor access to savings accounts.<ref name=Karlan>BBC:[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003s71s Business Weekly], 2 August 2009</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cooperative banking]]\n* [[Count Me In (charity)]]\n* [[Crowdfunding]]\n* [[Crowd sourcing]]\n* [[Flat rate (finance)]]\n* [[Microcredit for water supply and sanitation]]\n* [[Microgrant]]\n* [[M-Pesa]]\n* [[Project Enterprise]]\n* [[Solidarity lending]]\n* [[The Women's Development Bank]]\n* [[Oikocredit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Adams, Dale, Doug Graham and J.D.
