{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===14===\n\n===13===\n*[[Baldiri Alavedra]], 76, Spanish footballer, ([[CE Sabadell FC]]), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.fcbarcelona.cat/ca/futbol/primer-equip/noticies/1655433/mor-baldiri-alavedra Mor Baldiri Alavedra] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Juan Cotino]], 70, Spanish businessman and politician, [[Corts Valencianes|President of Valencian Courts]] (2011\u20132014) and [[Directorate-General of the Police|Director General of the National Police]] (1996\u20132002), COVID-19.<ref>[https://elpais.com/espana/2020-04-13/muere-por-coronavirus-juan-cotino-exdirector-de-la-policia-nacional-y-antiguo-dirigente-del-pp.html Muere por coronavirus Juan Cotino, exdirector de la Polic\u00eda Nacional y antiguo dirigente del PP] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Ashok Desai]], 77, Indian lawyer, [[Attorney General of India|Attorney General]] (1996\u20131998) and [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] (1989\u20131990).<ref>[https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/senior-advocate-and-former-attorney-general-for-india-ashok-desai-passes-away-155152 Senior Advocate And Former Attorney General For India Ashok Desai Passes Away]</ref>\n*[[Ryo Kawasaki]], 73, Japanese jazz fusion guitarist and composer.<ref>[https://kultuur.err.ee/1076803/suri-ryo-kawasaki Suri Ryo Kawasaki] {{in lang|et}}</ref>\n*[[Landelino Lavilla Alsina]], 85, Spanish politician, [[President of the Congress of Deputies]] (1979\u20131982), [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)|Minister of Justice]] (1976\u20131979) and member of the [[Spanish Council of State|Council of State]] (since 1983).<ref>[https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2020/04/13/5e944afffdddff16238b45e9.html Muere Landelino Lavilla, consejero de Estado y presidente del Congreso durante el 23-F] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Vicente Magsaysay]], 80, Filipino politician, [[Governor of Zambales]] (1968\u20131986, 1998\u20132007).<ref>[https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/13/20/former-zambales-governor-vic-magsaysay-passes-away Former Zambales governor Vic Magsaysay passes away]</ref>\n*[[Moraes Moreira]], 72, Brazilian guitarist and singer ([[Novos Baianos]]).<ref>[https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br/clica-brasilia/morre-o-cantor-e-compositor-moraes-moreira/ Morre o cantor e compositor Moraes Moreira] {{in lang|pt}}</ref>\n*[[M.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.
