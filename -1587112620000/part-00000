The Servites convinced him to do two more frescoes in the forecourt, though of a different subject matter: a ''Procession of the Magi'' (or ''Adoration'', containing a self-portrait) finished in 1511 and a ''Nativity of the Virgin''. These paintings met with respect, the correctness of the contours being particularly admired, and earned for Sarto the nickname of \"Andrea senza errori\" (Andrea the perfect). Towards 1512 he painted an ''Annunciation'' in the [[monastery]] of S. Gallo and a ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' (Dresden).\n\nBy 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescoes in the Chiostro dei Vorti (SS.

This led to an invitation from [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], in 1518, and he journeyed to Paris in June of that year, along with his pupil Andrea Squarzzella, leaving his wife, Lucrezia, in Florence.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAccording to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Andrea's pupil and biographer,<ref name = \"vasari\"/> Lucrezia wrote to Andrea and demanded he return to Italy. The King assented, but only on the understanding that his absence from [[France]] was to be short.  He then entrusted Andrea with a sum of money to be expended in purchasing works of art for the French Court.  By Vasari's account, Andrea took the money and used it to buy himself a house in Florence, thus ruining his reputation and preventing him from ever returning to France.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} The story inspired [[Robert Browning]]'s poem-monologue \"[[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto Called the 'Faultless Painter']]\" (1855),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |title=Stonehill |publisher=Faculty.stonehill.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120195210/http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 }}</ref> but is now believed by some historians to be apocryphal.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 University of Toronto Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104195856/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Later works in Florence==\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Assumption of the Virgin (Poppi Altarpiece) - WGA0416.jpg|thumb|''Assumption of the Virgin'' (Poppi Altarpiece), 1530]]\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto, Head of Saint John the Baptist, c. 1523, NGA 73856.jpg|thumb|left|''Head of Saint John the Baptist'', c. 1523, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\nIn 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the ''Faith'' and ''Charity''  in the cloister of the Scalzo. These were succeeded by the ''Dance of the [[Salome|Daughter of Herodias]]'', the ''Beheading of the Baptist'',  the ''Presentation of his head to [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]'', an allegory of Hope, the ''Apparition of the Angel to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]]'' (1523) and the monochrome ''Visitation''.  This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after Andrea had returned from Luco in [[Mugello region|Mugello]], whence an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Florence had driven him and his family. In 1525 he returned to paint in the Annunziata cloister the ''[[Madonna del Sacco (Andrea del Sarto)|Madonna del Sacco]]'', a [[lunette]] named after a sack against which Joseph is represented propped.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} In this painting the generous virgin's gown and her gaze indicate his influence on the early style of pupil [[Jacopo Pontormo|Pontormo]].\n\nIn 1523 Andrea painted a copy of the portrait group of [[Pope Leo X]] by Raphael; this copy is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], while the original remains at the Pitti Palace. The Raphael painting was owned by [[Ottaviano de' Medici]], and requested by [[Federico II Gonzaga]], Duke of [[Mantua]].  Unwilling to part with the original, Ottaviano retained Andrea to produce a copy, which he passed to the Duke as the original. The imitation was so faithful that even [[Giulio Romano]], who had himself manipulated the original to some extent, was completely fooled; and, on showing the copy years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the truth, he could be convinced that it was not genuine only when a private mark on the canvas was pointed out to him by Vasari.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAndrea's final work at the Scalzo was the ''Nativity of the Baptist'' (1526).  In the following year he completed his last important painting, a [[Last Supper (Andrea del Sarto)|''Last Supper'']] at [[Chiesa San Salvi|San Salvi]] (now an inner suburb of Florence), in which all the characters appear to be portraits.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}. The church is now the [[museo del cenacolo di andrea del sarto]].\n\nA number of his paintings were considered to be self-portraits. A ''Portrait of a Young Man ''in the [[National Gallery, London]] was formerly believed to be a self-portrait,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-del-sarto-portrait-of-a-young-man |title=National Gallery website |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> as was the Portrait of Becuccio Bicchieraio in [[National Gallery of Scotland]],<ref>[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4:322/results/0/5398/ National Gallery of Scotland website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620214812/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4%3A322/results/0/5398/ |date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref> but both are now known not to be. There is a self-portrait at [[Alnwick Castle]], a young man about twenty years, with his elbow on a table. Another youthful portrait is in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], and the [[Pitti Palace]] contains more than one.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\n===''Madonna of the Harpies''===\n[[Image:Andrea del Sarto - Madonna of the Harpies - WGA00369.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'', 1517]]\nThe ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'' is a depiction of the Virgin and child on a pedestal, flanked by two saints (Bonaventure or Francis and John the Evangelist), and at her feet two cherubs. The pedestal is decorated with a relief depicting some feminine figures interpreted as [[harpy|harpies]] and thus gave rise, in English, to the name of the painting. Originally completed in 1517 for the convent of San Francesco dei Macci, the altarpiece now resides in the Uffizi.  In an Italy swamped with a tsunami of Madonnas, it would be easy to overlook this work; however, this commonly copied scheme also lends itself to comparison of his style with that of his contemporaries. The figures have a Leonardo da Vinci-like aura, and the stable pyramid of their composition provides a unified structure. In some ways, his rigid adherence is more classical than Leonardo da Vinci's but less so than [[Fra Bartolomeo]]'s representations of the Holy Family.\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Piet\u00e0 with Saints - WGA0395.jpg|thumb|''Piet\u00e0 with Saints'', 1523-24]]\n\n==Personal life==\nAndrea married Lucrezia (del Fede), widow of a hatter named Carlo, of [[Recanati]], on 26 December 1512.  Lucrezia appears in many of his paintings, often as a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].  However, Vasari describes her as \"faithless, jealous, and vixenish with the apprentices.\"<ref name = \"vasari\"/>  She is similarly characterized in [[Robert Browning]]'s poem.\n\nAndrea died in Florence at age 43 during an outbreak of [[Bubonic Plague]] at the end of September 1530.

All five frescoes were completed before the close of 1510.<ref name=\":0\" /> The original contract also required him to paint five scenes of the life and miracles of St Sebastian, but he told the Servites that he no longer wished to continue with the second cycle, most likely due to the low remuneration. The Servites convinced him to do two more frescoes in the forecourt, though of a different subject matter: a ''Procession of the Magi'' (or ''Adoration'', containing a self-portrait) finished in 1511 and a ''Nativity of the Virgin''. These paintings met with respect, the correctness of the contours being particularly admired, and earned for Sarto the nickname of \"Andrea senza errori\" (Andrea the perfect). Towards 1512 he painted an ''Annunciation'' in the [[monastery]] of S. Gallo and a ''Marriage of Saint Catherine'' (Dresden).\n\nBy 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescoes in the Chiostro dei Vorti (SS. Annunziata), including his masterpiece, the [[Nativity of the Virgin (del Sarto)|''Nativity of the Virgin'']], which fuses the influence of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]] and [[Fra Bartolomeo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/ghirland/domenico/6tornab/61tornab/2birth.html |title=Compare it to Ghirlandaio's Quattrocento treatment |publisher=Wga.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> By November 1515 he had finished at the nearby Chiostro of the Confraternity of St John the Baptist, commonly known as the Scalzo the ''Allegory of Justice'' and the ''Baptist preaching in the desert'', followed in 1517 by ''John Baptizing the People''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Visit to France==\n[[Image:Sarto life.jpg|thumb|left|Del Sarto's most ambitious monument, in terms of the amount of time he devoted to it, is the [[grisaille]] series in the Chiostro dello Scalzo.]]\nBefore the end of 1516, a Piet\u00e0 of Del Sarto's composition, and afterwards a Madonna, were sent to the [[France|French]] Court. This led to an invitation from [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], in 1518, and he journeyed to Paris in June of that year, along with his pupil Andrea Squarzzella, leaving his wife, Lucrezia, in Florence.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAccording to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Andrea's pupil and biographer,<ref name = \"vasari\"/> Lucrezia wrote to Andrea and demanded he return to Italy. The King assented, but only on the understanding that his absence from [[France]] was to be short.  He then entrusted Andrea with a sum of money to be expended in purchasing works of art for the French Court.  By Vasari's account, Andrea took the money and used it to buy himself a house in Florence, thus ruining his reputation and preventing him from ever returning to France.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} The story inspired [[Robert Browning]]'s poem-monologue \"[[Andrea del Sarto (poem)|Andrea del Sarto Called the 'Faultless Painter']]\" (1855),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |title=Stonehill |publisher=Faculty.stonehill.edu |accessdate=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120195210/http://faculty.stonehill.edu/geverett/rb/sarto.htm |archivedate=2012-11-20 }}</ref> but is now believed by some historians to be apocryphal.<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 University of Toronto Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104195856/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/264.html#1 |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Later works in Florence==\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Assumption of the Virgin (Poppi Altarpiece) - WGA0416.jpg|thumb|''Assumption of the Virgin'' (Poppi Altarpiece), 1530]]\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto, Head of Saint John the Baptist, c. 1523, NGA 73856.jpg|thumb|left|''Head of Saint John the Baptist'', c. 1523, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\nIn 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the ''Faith'' and ''Charity''  in the cloister of the Scalzo. These were succeeded by the ''Dance of the [[Salome|Daughter of Herodias]]'', the ''Beheading of the Baptist'',  the ''Presentation of his head to [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]'', an allegory of Hope, the ''Apparition of the Angel to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]]'' (1523) and the monochrome ''Visitation''.  This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after Andrea had returned from Luco in [[Mugello region|Mugello]], whence an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Florence had driven him and his family. In 1525 he returned to paint in the Annunziata cloister the ''[[Madonna del Sacco (Andrea del Sarto)|Madonna del Sacco]]'', a [[lunette]] named after a sack against which Joseph is represented propped.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} In this painting the generous virgin's gown and her gaze indicate his influence on the early style of pupil [[Jacopo Pontormo|Pontormo]].\n\nIn 1523 Andrea painted a copy of the portrait group of [[Pope Leo X]] by Raphael; this copy is now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]], while the original remains at the Pitti Palace. The Raphael painting was owned by [[Ottaviano de' Medici]], and requested by [[Federico II Gonzaga]], Duke of [[Mantua]].  Unwilling to part with the original, Ottaviano retained Andrea to produce a copy, which he passed to the Duke as the original. The imitation was so faithful that even [[Giulio Romano]], who had himself manipulated the original to some extent, was completely fooled; and, on showing the copy years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the truth, he could be convinced that it was not genuine only when a private mark on the canvas was pointed out to him by Vasari.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\nAndrea's final work at the Scalzo was the ''Nativity of the Baptist'' (1526).  In the following year he completed his last important painting, a [[Last Supper (Andrea del Sarto)|''Last Supper'']] at [[Chiesa San Salvi|San Salvi]] (now an inner suburb of Florence), in which all the characters appear to be portraits.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}. The church is now the [[museo del cenacolo di andrea del sarto]].\n\nA number of his paintings were considered to be self-portraits. A ''Portrait of a Young Man ''in the [[National Gallery, London]] was formerly believed to be a self-portrait,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-del-sarto-portrait-of-a-young-man |title=National Gallery website |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> as was the Portrait of Becuccio Bicchieraio in [[National Gallery of Scotland]],<ref>[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4:322/results/0/5398/ National Gallery of Scotland website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620214812/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_az/4%3A322/results/0/5398/ |date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref> but both are now known not to be. There is a self-portrait at [[Alnwick Castle]], a young man about twenty years, with his elbow on a table. Another youthful portrait is in the [[Uffizi Gallery]], and the [[Pitti Palace]] contains more than one.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}}\n\n===''Madonna of the Harpies''===\n[[Image:Andrea del Sarto - Madonna of the Harpies - WGA00369.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'', 1517]]\nThe ''[[Madonna of the Harpies]]'' is a depiction of the Virgin and child on a pedestal, flanked by two saints (Bonaventure or Francis and John the Evangelist), and at her feet two cherubs. The pedestal is decorated with a relief depicting some feminine figures interpreted as [[harpy|harpies]] and thus gave rise, in English, to the name of the painting. Originally completed in 1517 for the convent of San Francesco dei Macci, the altarpiece now resides in the Uffizi.  In an Italy swamped with a tsunami of Madonnas, it would be easy to overlook this work; however, this commonly copied scheme also lends itself to comparison of his style with that of his contemporaries. The figures have a Leonardo da Vinci-like aura, and the stable pyramid of their composition provides a unified structure. In some ways, his rigid adherence is more classical than Leonardo da Vinci's but less so than [[Fra Bartolomeo]]'s representations of the Holy Family.\n[[File:Andrea del Sarto - Piet\u00e0 with Saints - WGA0395.jpg|thumb|''Piet\u00e0 with Saints'', 1523-24]]\n\n==Personal life==\nAndrea married Lucrezia (del Fede), widow of a hatter named Carlo, of [[Recanati]], on 26 December 1512.  Lucrezia appears in many of his paintings, often as a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].  However, Vasari describes her as \"faithless, jealous, and vixenish with the apprentices.\"<ref name = \"vasari\"/>  She is similarly characterized in [[Robert Browning]]'s poem.\n\nAndrea died in Florence at age 43 during an outbreak of [[Bubonic Plague]] at the end of September 1530.

He is said to have thought very highly of Andrea's talents.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=970}} Of those who initially followed his style in Florence, the most prominent would have been [[Jacopo Pontormo]], but also [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]] and [[Jacopino del Conte]].
