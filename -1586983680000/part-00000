The show starred [[Sharon Gless]] and [[Tyne Daly]] as [[NYPD|New York City police detectives]] who led very different lives: Christine Cagney (Gless) was a career-minded single woman, while Mary Beth Lacey (Daly) was a married working mother. The series was set in a fictionalized version of [[Manhattan]]'s 14th Precinct (known as \"Midtown South\"). For six consecutive years, one of the two lead actresses won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama]] (four wins for Daly, two for Gless), a winning streak matched only once since in any major category by a show.\n\n==Development==\nProducer [[Barney Rosenzweig]] was influenced by the feminist movement through his then-girlfriend [[Barbara Corday]], who recommended to him [[Molly Haskell]]'s book ''[[From Reverence to Rape]]''. After learning through Haskell that there had never been a female [[buddy film]], Rosenzweig sought to make one, a comedy initially titled ''[[Paul Newman|Newman]] & [[Robert Redford|Redford]]'' (before changing the title for legal reasons). Corday & [[Barbara Avedon]] wrote the script. No studio wanted to make the film, so Corday considered taking it to television. Rosenzweig took the script, removed the main plot (leaving only the character development), and took it to all networks, but only CBS picked it up.<ref>Abramson, Stephen J. [http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/barney-rosenzweig# Interview with Barney Rosenzweig]. ''Archive of American Television'' (October 15, 2008).</ref>\n\n==Original cast==\nActress [[Loretta Swit]] played the role of Christine Cagney in the original television movie (October 1981), but was forced to decline the role in the series when the producers of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' refused to let her out of her contract. When the movie was picked up as a series, first airing with six episodes as a midseason replacement in the spring of 1982, [[Meg Foster]] portrayed the character. When the show was picked up for a regular season in 1982, Foster was replaced with [[Sharon Gless]] because CBS deemed Foster too aggressive and too likely to be perceived as a lesbian by the viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/dont-wagers-66518/|title=I don't have any wagers, ...|author=TV Guide News|date=February 16, 2006|work=TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\nCBS executives hoped Gless would portray Cagney as more conventionally \"feminine\" and attempted to pressure the producers to remake Christine into a more \"high-class\", snobbish woman from wealthy parents. Barney Rosenzweig and Barbara Corday initially refused to change Christine Cagney from a tough, witty, working-class woman. Shortly into Gless's tenure on the program, Rosenzweig and Corday compromised with the network brass. They further developed Cagney's background, explaining gradually in a loose storyline that she may have been born to a somewhat well-to-do professional mother, Maureen, who had a relationship with police officer Charles Cagney ([[Dick O'Neill]]), who came from working-class roots. They separated soon after Christine and her brother Brian ([[David Ackroyd]]) were born. She was partially raised in an uptown [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] world, which she appreciated; however, the trappings of the upper-middle social strata sometimes drove her to miss her father's lifestyle, and she and her father therefore established a special bond.\n\nCagney was a bit quieter and more reserved than her vivacious, talkative, loud partner Mary Beth Lacey, but could still relate to the world with attitudes that could be shared by people across the social spectrum.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Main|List of Cagney & Lacey episodes}}\n[[Al Waxman]] co-starred as Cagney and Lacey's good-natured and sometimes blustery supervisor, Lt. Bert Samuels. [[Carl Lumbly]] and [[Martin Kove]] played, respectively, fellow detectives Marcus Petrie and Victor Isbecki. Sidney Clute played veteran detective Paul La Guardia.  [[John Karlen]] co-starred as Mary Beth's husband, Harvey Lacey, and [[Tony La Torre]] and [[Troy Slaten]] played their sons, Harvey Lacey, Jr. and Michael Lacey, respectively. [[Harvey Atkin]] played desk sergeant Ronald Coleman. [[Jason Bernard]] had the recurring role of Deputy Inspector Marquette during the first two seasons. When the show was brought back in March 1984, Marquette had been replaced by Dep. Inspector Knelman ([[Michael Fairman]]), who lasted the duration of the series. In the fourth season, Christine entered into a relationship with Sgt. Dory McKenna ([[Barry Primus]]), who battled a drug addiction. After a tumultuous courtship, Christine left him and soon after took up with a more stable suitor, David Keeler ([[Stephen Macht]]), a local attorney.\n\nOne of the most significant cast changes occurred early in the fifth season, upon the death of Sidney Clute from cancer on October 2, 1985, at the age of 69. Off screen, Det. LaGuardia had retired from the 14th Precinct and moved to [[New Jersey]] with a new female companion less than half his age. Clute had completed filming a few episodes of the 1985\u201386 season prior to his death. In his honor, the producers kept Clute's name in the opening credits for the rest of the series.\n\nLaGuardia's immediate replacement in the fifth season was Det. Jonah Newman ([[Dan Shor]]), a boyish ingenue with an elevated sense of himself. Newman, while popular with the guys, was not above stepping on anyone in order to get the coveted promotion of Detective Second Grade. As a result, Chris and Mary Beth had to force a strained relationship with him at best. Newman developed a crush on Chris but she never knew. Eventually, Newman was partnered with veteran Al Corassa ([[Paul Mantee]]), who became a regular midway through season five (Mantee had made three guest appearances in late 1985, in which his character's name was Det. Thomas in the first two episodes, and Corassa in the third) and officially took up the role of experience that LaGuardia had vacated. Their partnership met a sad end in May 1986, when Newman was killed from a random gunshot outside of the local district court, just after receiving his promotion to Second Grade.\n\nThe beginning of the sixth season saw the arrival of Manny Esposito ([[Robert Hegyes]]), a young, street-savvy detective who became Corassa's new partner. There was quite a clash between the two, as Esposito's freewheeling lifestyle (represented by his casual dress on the job, the desire to make a quick buck, and three ex-wives) put him in contrast with Corassa, the older, more conservative family man with a heightened sense of professionalism. Supporting characters added to the precinct at this time were rookie Officer Tom Basil (Barry Laws) and Officer Beverley Faverty (Beverley Faverty). The following year, Petrie was promoted to sergeant and then departed the 14th Precinct (Carl Lumbly had decided to leave the series). In his place, singer [[Merry Clayton]] joined the cast as Verna Dee Jordan, the first new female detective at the precinct since the additions of Cagney and Lacey. Jordan had joined law enforcement in middle age to better herself, after having been a single mother raising four children (now grown) on welfare.\n\n[[Dick O'Neill]] played a recurring role as Cagney's alcoholic father, Charlie Cagney, a former NYPD officer who regaled her with stories of the old days; Christine later fought alcoholism as well.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121119085017/http://www.tvacres.com/ethnic_irish_a_k.htm Charlie Cagney profile], TVAcres.com; accessed June 6, 2014.</ref> In the fourth season, Mary Beth becomes pregnant; she and Harvey welcome in a baby daughter, Alice, in the fall of 1985. Alice Lacey was played by alternating twins Dana & Paige Bardolph from 1985 to 1987, with toddler Michelle Sepe taking over for the seventh season.\n\n==Cancellation and return==\n''Cagney & Lacey'' premiered in March 1982 with high hopes from the industry, in the wake of the TV movie. Reviews of the series, however, with Meg Foster in place of Loretta Swit, were mixed. Critics praised the level of storytelling, but put emphasis on the aggressiveness that both Daly and Foster expressed with their characters. As soon as the six-episode order was finished in late April, CBS canceled the program due to poor ratings. Executive producer [[Barney Rosenzweig]] was determined to reverse the network's decision. Sharon Gless had been initially unavailable for the movie and series, which were produced by [[Orion Television|Orion]], because of her long-running contract to [[Universal Television]] (she was the last actress ever to be signed to a long-term contract with a studio, in 1972). Gless was even actively utilizing her Universal contract at the time the series went into production, having taken over as female lead (from [[Lynn Redgrave]] who left the series in a dispute with producers) on the CBS sitcom ''[[House Calls (TV series)|House Calls]].'' However, rumors were also rampant that ''House Calls'' was getting the axe that spring.\n\nPrior to the unveiling of that year's network upfronts, a CBS executive noted to the press that the cancellation of ''Cagney & Lacey'' was highly motivated by the jarringly tough nature of the female leads as well as low ratings. The official claimed in response to the strong portrayal of Daly and Foster that \"we've perceived them as dykes.\" This remark set off massive protest, and put Rosenzweig into high gear in his dealings with CBS. The cancellation of ''House Calls'' was announced among insider circles just before upfronts, and Rosenzweig pressured CBS executives to relaunch ''Cagney & Lacey'' in the fall with Gless replacing Foster. Gless met with ''Cagney & Lacey'' producers again to consider the role, but while always having taken to the character, had doubts about joining for the fall of 1982 because, after ''House Calls'', she \"didn't want to make a career of replacing actresses.\"\n\nRatings, however, were still low during the first year Daly and Gless co-starred on the series. ''Cagney & Lacey'' was canceled by CBS a second time in May 1983, but after almost a year of decreased buzz about the show, an ever-larger public outcry exploded upon the series's axing. Fans of the show, organized by Rosenzweig,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/arts/cagney-lacey-police-series-on-cbs.html \"'Cagney & Lacey', Police Series on CBS\"], nytimes.com; July 2, 1984; accessed May 19, 2014.</ref> staged a letter-writing campaign. At the same time, CBS switched its time slot for what was to have been its final three months on the air during summer reruns. This relocation resulted in the ratings suddenly rising. The viewer protest, coupled with the post-cancellation improvement in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsens]] and the [[Emmy]] nomination that year (which [[Tyne Daly]] won in September), resulted in success for the public. That fall, CBS announced the return of ''Cagney & Lacey'' as a mid-season entry. The network would have wanted to return it sooner, but not long after the second cancelation came to pass,  the sets at Orion had already been destroyed, and the cast had been let out of their contracts. One cast member, Tony La Torre, had already joined another series, the ABC sitcom ''[[9 to 5 (TV series)|9 to 5]]''. When nearly all of the ''Cagney & Lacey'' cast received new contracts in late 1983, La Torre returned as well after ''[[9 to 5 (TV series)|9 to 5]]'' was canceled by ABC just weeks into the 1983\u201384 season. ''Cagney & Lacey'' went back into production in January 1984 and returned to air on March 19 of that year.\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' celebrated the show's return with the cover reading \"Welcome Back, ''Cagney & Lacey'' \u2013 You want them! You've got them!\". The show finished in the top 10 for the 1983\u201384 season, and went on to earn 36 [[Emmy Award]] nominations and 14 wins throughout its run until 1988, including six nominations for stars Daly and Gless: four wins for Daly and two for Gless. The series itself won two consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Drama Series in 1985 and 1986. The show's ratings leveled out to where it hovered around 30th place in the Nielsens during seasons four to six, a period where many state the show to have been in its creative peak.\n\nThe series continued to air Monday nights at 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m. EST/9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. CST until the middle of the 1987\u201388 season, holding its own against ABC's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and ''[[NBC Monday Night at the Movies]]''. Midway through its seventh season, ''Cagney & Lacey'' was moved to Tuesdays at 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m. EST/9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. CST, where it began to compete against ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]'' (ABC) and ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' (NBC). ''Cagney & Lacey'' lost viewers to the first-year critical success of ''thirtysomething'', which, despite being the time slot winner, only ranked #45 overall. CBS' reason for relocating ''Cagney & Lacey'' was because it was believed that its Monday slot would further build an audience for ''[[Wiseguy]]'', another new critical hit of the season that had average ratings at best. By the end of the season, ''Cagney & Lacey'' was left at 53rd place, and the 20-point drop from the previous season was enough for CBS to have doubts about renewing the show. With the final episode of the seventh season ending on a cliffhanger, CBS was considering bringing the show back, but when May 1988 upfronts were released, ''Cagney & Lacey'''s cancellation was confirmed. For the summer of 1988, the series moved one last time, not back to its familiar Monday time slot, but to Thursdays at 10 pm EST/9 CST. The series garnered considerable popularity internationally. It was originally shown in the UK on [[BBC1]] where it regularly made the top 10.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe first-season main-titles are accompanied by the theme song \"Ain't That the Way\" by Michael Stull, sung by Marie Cain, and shows the two lead characters being promoted to plainclothes detectives and later disguised as prostitutes.

The show starred [[Sharon Gless]] and [[Tyne Daly]] as [[NYPD|New York City police detectives]] who led very different lives: Christine Cagney (Gless) was a career-minded single woman, while Mary Beth Lacey (Daly) was a married working mother. The series was set in a fictionalized version of [[Manhattan]]'s 14th Precinct (known as \"Midtown South\"). For six consecutive years, one of the two lead actresses won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama]] (four wins for Daly, two for Gless), a winning streak matched only once since in any major category by a show.\n\n==Development==\nProducer [[Barney Rosenzweig]] was influenced by the feminist movement through his then-girlfriend [[Barbara Corday]], who recommended to him [[Molly Haskell]]'s book ''[[From Reverence to Rape]]''. After learning through Haskell that there had never been a female [[buddy film]], Rosenzweig sought to make one, a comedy initially titled ''[[Paul Newman|Newman]] & [[Robert Redford|Redford]]'' (before changing the title for legal reasons). Corday & [[Barbara Avedon]] wrote the script. No studio wanted to make the film, so Corday considered taking it to television. Rosenzweig took the script, removed the main plot (leaving only the character development), and took it to all networks, but only CBS picked it up.<ref>Abramson, Stephen J. [http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/barney-rosenzweig# Interview with Barney Rosenzweig]. ''Archive of American Television'' (October 15, 2008).</ref>\n\n==Original cast==\nActress [[Loretta Swit]] played the role of Christine Cagney in the original television movie (October 1981), but was forced to decline the role in the series when the producers of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' refused to let her out of her contract. When the movie was picked up as a series, first airing with six episodes as a midseason replacement in the spring of 1982, [[Meg Foster]] portrayed the character. When the show was picked up for a regular season in 1982, Foster was replaced with [[Sharon Gless]] because CBS deemed Foster too aggressive and too likely to be perceived as a lesbian by the viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/dont-wagers-66518/|title=I don't have any wagers, ...|author=TV Guide News|date=February 16, 2006|work=TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\nCBS executives hoped Gless would portray Cagney as more conventionally \"feminine\" and attempted to pressure the producers to remake Christine into a more \"high-class\", snobbish woman from wealthy parents. Barney Rosenzweig and Barbara Corday initially refused to change Christine Cagney from a tough, witty, working-class woman. Shortly into Gless's tenure on the program, Rosenzweig and Corday compromised with the network brass. They further developed Cagney's background, explaining gradually in a loose storyline that she may have been born to a somewhat well-to-do professional mother, Maureen, who had a relationship with police officer Charles Cagney ([[Dick O'Neill]]), who came from working-class roots. They separated soon after Christine and her brother Brian ([[David Ackroyd]]) were born. She was partially raised in an uptown [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] world, which she appreciated; however, the trappings of the upper-middle social strata sometimes drove her to miss her father's lifestyle, and she and her father therefore established a special bond.\n\nCagney was a bit quieter and more reserved than her vivacious, talkative, loud partner Mary Beth Lacey, but could still relate to the world with attitudes that could be shared by people across the social spectrum.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Main|List of Cagney & Lacey episodes}}\n[[Al Waxman]] co-starred as Cagney and Lacey's good-natured and sometimes blustery supervisor, Lt. Bert Samuels. [[Carl Lumbly]] and [[Martin Kove]] played, respectively, fellow detectives Marcus Petrie and Victor Isbecki. Sidney Clute played veteran detective Paul La Guardia.  [[John Karlen]] co-starred as Mary Beth's husband, Harvey Lacey, and [[Tony La Torre]] and [[Troy Slaten]] played their sons, Harvey Lacey, Jr. and Michael Lacey, respectively. [[Harvey Atkin]] played desk sergeant Ronald Coleman. [[Jason Bernard]] had the recurring role of Deputy Inspector Marquette during the first two seasons. When the show was brought back in March 1984, Marquette had been replaced by Dep. Inspector Knelman ([[Michael Fairman]]), who lasted the duration of the series. In the fourth season, Christine entered into a relationship with Sgt. Dory McKenna ([[Barry Primus]]), who battled a drug addiction. After a tumultuous courtship, Christine left him and soon after took up with a more stable suitor, David Keeler ([[Stephen Macht]]), a local attorney.\n\nOne of the most significant cast changes occurred early in the fifth season, upon the death of Sidney Clute from cancer on October 2, 1985, at the age of 69. Off screen, Det. LaGuardia had retired from the 14th Precinct and moved to [[New Jersey]] with a new female companion less than half his age. Clute had completed filming a few episodes of the 1985\u201386 season prior to his death. In his honor, the producers kept Clute's name in the opening credits for the rest of the series.\n\nLaGuardia's immediate replacement in the fifth season was Det. Jonah Newman ([[Dan Shor]]), a boyish ingenue with an elevated sense of himself. Newman, while popular with the guys, was not above stepping on anyone in order to get the coveted promotion of Detective Second Grade. As a result, Chris and Mary Beth had to force a strained relationship with him at best. Newman developed a crush on Chris but she never knew. Eventually, Newman was partnered with veteran Al Corassa ([[Paul Mantee]]), who became a regular midway through season five (Mantee had made three guest appearances in late 1985, in which his character's name was Det. Thomas in the first two episodes, and Corassa in the third) and officially took up the role of experience that LaGuardia had vacated. Their partnership met a sad end in May 1986, when Newman was killed from a random gunshot outside of the local district court, just after receiving his promotion to Second Grade.\n\nThe beginning of the sixth season saw the arrival of Manny Esposito ([[Robert Hegyes]]), a young, street-savvy detective who became Corassa's new partner. There was quite a clash between the two, as Esposito's freewheeling lifestyle (represented by his casual dress on the job, the desire to make a quick buck, and three ex-wives) put him in contrast with Corassa, the older, more conservative family man with a heightened sense of professionalism. Supporting characters added to the precinct at this time were rookie Officer Tom Basil (Barry Laws) and Officer Beverley Faverty (Beverley Faverty). The following year, Petrie was promoted to sergeant and then departed the 14th Precinct (Carl Lumbly had decided to leave the series). In his place, singer [[Merry Clayton]] joined the cast as Verna Dee Jordan, the first new female detective at the precinct since the additions of Cagney and Lacey. Jordan had joined law enforcement in middle age to better herself, after having been a single mother raising four children (now grown) on welfare.\n\n[[Dick O'Neill]] played a recurring role as Cagney's alcoholic father, Charlie Cagney, a former NYPD officer who regaled her with stories of the old days; Christine later fought alcoholism as well.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121119085017/http://www.tvacres.com/ethnic_irish_a_k.htm Charlie Cagney profile], TVAcres.com; accessed June 6, 2014.</ref> In the fourth season, Mary Beth becomes pregnant; she and Harvey welcome in a baby daughter, Alice, in the fall of 1985. Alice Lacey was played by alternating twins Dana & Paige Bardolph from 1985 to 1987, with toddler Michelle Sepe taking over for the seventh season.\n\n==Cancelation and return==\n''Cagney & Lacey'' premiered in March 1982 with high hopes from the industry, in the wake of the TV movie. Reviews of the series, however, with Meg Foster in place of Loretta Swit, were mixed. Critics praised the level of storytelling, but put emphasis on the aggressiveness that both Daly and Foster expressed with their characters. As soon as the six-episode order was finished in late April, CBS canceled the program due to poor ratings. Executive producer [[Barney Rosenzweig]] was determined to reverse the network's decision. Sharon Gless had been initially unavailable for the movie and series, which were produced by [[Orion Television|Orion]], because of her long-running contract to [[Universal Television]] (she was the last actress ever to be signed to a long-term contract with a studio, in 1972). Gless was even actively utilizing her Universal contract at the time the series went into production, having taken over as female lead (from [[Lynn Redgrave]] who left the series in a dispute with producers) on the CBS sitcom ''[[House Calls (TV series)|House Calls]].'' However, rumors were also rampant that ''House Calls'' was getting the axe that spring.\n\nPrior to the unveiling of that year's network upfronts, a CBS executive noted to the press that the cancellation of ''Cagney & Lacey'' was highly motivated by the jarringly tough nature of the female leads as well as low ratings. The official claimed in response to the strong portrayal of Daly and Foster that \"we've perceived them as dykes.\" This remark set off massive protest, and put Rosenzweig into high gear in his dealings with CBS. The cancellation of ''House Calls'' was announced among insider circles just before upfronts, and Rosenzweig pressured CBS executives to relaunch ''Cagney & Lacey'' in the fall with Gless replacing Foster. Gless met with ''Cagney & Lacey'' producers again to consider the role, but while always having taken to the character, had doubts about joining for the fall of 1982 because, after ''House Calls'', she \"didn't want to make a career of replacing actresses.\"\n\nRatings, however, were still low during the first year Daly and Gless co-starred on the series. ''Cagney & Lacey'' was canceled by CBS a second time in May 1983, but after almost a year of decreased buzz about the show, an ever-larger public outcry exploded upon the series's axing. Fans of the show, organized by Rosenzweig,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/02/arts/cagney-lacey-police-series-on-cbs.html \"'Cagney & Lacey', Police Series on CBS\"], nytimes.com; July 2, 1984; accessed May 19, 2014.</ref> staged a letter-writing campaign. At the same time, CBS switched its time slot for what was to have been its final three months on the air during summer reruns. This relocation resulted in the ratings suddenly rising. The viewer protest, coupled with the post-cancellation improvement in the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsens]] and the [[Emmy]] nomination that year (which [[Tyne Daly]] won in September), resulted in success for the public. That fall, CBS announced the return of ''Cagney & Lacey'' as a mid-season entry. The network would have wanted to return it sooner, but not long after the second cancelation came to pass,  the sets at Orion had already been destroyed, and the cast had been let out of their contracts. One cast member, Tony La Torre, had already joined another series, the ABC sitcom ''[[9 to 5 (TV series)|9 to 5]]''. When nearly all of the ''Cagney & Lacey'' cast received new contracts in late 1983, La Torre returned as well after ''[[9 to 5 (TV series)|9 to 5]]'' was canceled by ABC just weeks into the 1983\u201384 season. ''Cagney & Lacey'' went back into production in January 1984 and returned to air on March 19 of that year.\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' celebrated the show's return with the cover reading \"Welcome Back, ''Cagney & Lacey'' \u2013 You want them! You've got them!\". The show finished in the top 10 for the 1983\u201384 season, and went on to earn 36 [[Emmy Award]] nominations and 14 wins throughout its run until 1988, including six nominations for stars Daly and Gless: four wins for Daly and two for Gless. The series itself won two consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Drama Series in 1985 and 1986. The show's ratings leveled out to where it hovered around 30th place in the Nielsens during seasons four to six, a period where many state the show to have been in its creative peak.\n\nThe series continued to air Monday nights at 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m. EST/9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. CST until the middle of the 1987\u201388 season, holding its own against ABC's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and ''[[NBC Monday Night at the Movies]]''. Midway through its seventh season, ''Cagney & Lacey'' was moved to Tuesdays at 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m. EST/9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. CST, where it began to compete against ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]'' (ABC) and ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' (NBC). ''Cagney & Lacey'' lost viewers to the first-year critical success of ''thirtysomething'', which, despite being the time slot winner, only ranked #45 overall. CBS' reason for relocating ''Cagney & Lacey'' was because it was believed that its Monday slot would further build an audience for ''[[Wiseguy]]'', another new critical hit of the season that had average ratings at best. By the end of the season, ''Cagney & Lacey'' was left at 53rd place, and the 20-point drop from the previous season was enough for CBS to have doubts about renewing the show. With the final episode of the seventh season ending on a cliffhanger, CBS was considering bringing the show back, but when May 1988 upfronts were released, ''Cagney & Lacey'''s cancellation was confirmed. For the summer of 1988, the series moved one last time, not back to its familiar Monday time slot, but to Thursdays at 10 pm EST/9 CST. The series garnered considerable popularity internationally. It was originally shown in the UK on [[BBC1]] where it regularly made the top 10.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe first-season main-titles are accompanied by the theme song \"Ain't That the Way\" by Michael Stull, sung by Marie Cain, and shows the two lead characters being promoted to plainclothes detectives and later disguised as prostitutes. This was replaced the following season by an instrumental theme composed by [[Bill Conti]] set to a collage of action and comical scenes featuring the characters from the series.\n\n==Reception==\n===Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "ISO/IEC 11179", "text_new": "{{short description|standard for metadata registries}}\nThe '''ISO/IEC 11179''' [[Metadata registry|Metadata Registry]] (MDR) standard is an '''international standard''' for representing [[metadata]] for an organization in a [[metadata registry]]. It documents the standardization and registration of metadata to make data understandable and shareable.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-39940-9_907 | title=Metadata Registry, ISO/IEC 11179 | access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== Intended purpose ==\nOrganizations exchange data between computer systems precisely using [[enterprise application integration]] technologies. Completed transactions are often transferred to separate data warehouse and [[business rule]]s systems with structures designed to support data for analysis. A de facto standard model for data integration platforms is the [[Common Warehouse Metamodel]] (CWM). Data integration is often also solved as a problem of data, rather than metadata, with the use of so-called [[master data]]. ISO/IEC 11179 claims that it is a standard for metadata-driven exchange of data in an heterogeneous environment, based on exact definitions of data.\n\n== Structure of an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry ==\nThe ISO/IEC 11179 model is a result of two principles of semantic theory, combined with basic principles of data modelling.\n\nThe first principle from semantic theory is the thesaurus type relation between wider and more narrow (or specific) concepts, e.g. the wide concept \"income\" has a relation to the more narrow concept \"net income\".\n\nThe second principle from semantic theory is the relation between a concept and its representation, e.g., \"buy\" and \"purchase\" are the same concept although different terms are used.\n\nA basic principle of data modelling is the combination of an object class and a characteristic. For example, \"Person - hair color\".\n\nWhen applied to data modelling, ISO/IEC 11179 combines a wide \"concept\" with an \"object class\" to form a more specific \"data element concept\". For example, the high-level concept \"income\" is combined with the object class \"person\" to form the data element concept \"net income of person\". Note that \"net income\" is more specific than \"income\".\n\nThe different possible representations of a data element concept are then described with the use of one or more data elements. Differences in representation may be a result of the use of synonyms or different value domains in different data sets in a data holding. A value domain is the permitted range of values for a characteristic of an object class. An example of a value domain for \"sex of person\" is \"M = Male, F = Female, U = Unknown\". The letters M, F and U are then the permitted values of sex of person in a particular data set.\n\nThe data element concept \"monthly net income of person\" may thus have one data element called \"monthly net income of individual by 100 dollar groupings\" and one called \"monthly net income of person range 0-1000 dollars\", etc., depending on the heterogeneity of representation that exists within the data holdings covered by one ISO/IEC 11179 registry. Note that these two examples have different terms for the object class (person/individual) and different value sets (a 0-1000 dollar range as opposed to 100 dollar groupings).\n\nThe result of this is a catalogue of sorts, in which related data element concepts are grouped by a high-level concept and an object class, and data elements grouped by a shared data element concept. Strictly speaking, this is not a hierarchy, even if it resembles one.\n\nISO/IEC 11179 proper does not describe data as it is actually stored. It does not refer to the description of physical files, tables and columns. The ISO/IEC 11179 constructs are \"semantic\" as opposed to \"physical\" or \"technical\".\n\nThe standard has two main purposes: definition and exchange. The core object is the data element concept, since it defines a concept and, ideally, describes data independent of its representation in any one system, table, column or organisation.\n\n== Structure of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard ==\nThe standard consists of seven parts:\n\n* ISO/IEC 11179-1:2015 Framework (referred to as ISO/IEC 11179-1)\n* ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 Classification\n* ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 Registry metamodel and basic attributes\n* ISO/IEC 11179-4:2004 Formulation of data definitions\n* ISO/IEC 11179-5:2015 Naming and identification principles\n* ISO/IEC 11179-6:2015 Registration\n* ISO/IEC 11179-7:2019 Metamodel for data set registration\n\n\nPart 1 explains the purpose of each part. Part 3 specifies the metamodel that defines the registry. Part 7 is released per December 2019 and provides an extension to part 3 for registration of metadata about data sets. The other parts specify various aspects of the use of the registry.\n\n== Overview of 11179 Data Element ==\nThe [[data element]] is foundational concept in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry. The purpose of the registry is to maintain a semantically precise structure of data elements.\n\nEach Data element in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry:\n\n* should be '''registered''' according to the Registration guidelines (11179-6)\n* will be '''uniquely identified''' within the register (11179-5)\n* should be '''named''' according to Naming and Identification Principles (11179-5) See [[data element name]]\n* should be '''defined''' by the Formulation of Data Definitions rules (11179-4) See [[data element definition]] and\n* may be '''classified''' in a Classification Scheme (11179-2) See [[classification scheme]]\n\nData elements that store \"Codes\" or enumerated values must also specify the semantics of each of the code values with precise definitions.\n\n==Adoption of 11179 standards==\n[[Software AG]]'s COTS Metadata Registry (MDR) product supports the ISO 11179 standard and continues to be sold and used for this purpose in both commercial and government applications (see Vendor Tools section below).\n\nWhile commercial adoption is increasing, the spread of ISO/IEC 11179 has been more successful in the public sector. However, the reason for this is unclear. ISO membership is open to organizations through their national bodies.  Countries with public sector repositories across various industries include Australia, Canada, Germany, United States and the United Kingdom. \n\nThe United Nations and the US Government refer to and use the 11179 standards.  11179 is strongly recommended on the U.S. government's [[XML]] website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://xml.fido.gov/ |title=US Government's XML web site |access-date=2020-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215051245/http://xml.fido.gov/ |archive-date=2013-02-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is promoted by [[The Open Group]] as a foundation of the [[Universal Data Element Framework]].<ref>[http://www.opengroup.org/udef/ Universal Data Element Framework]</ref> The Open Group is a [[vendor-neutral]] and technology-neutral [[consortium]] working to enable access to integrated information within and between enterprises based on [[open standard]]s and global [[interoperability]].\n\n==Extensions to the ISO/IEC 11179 standard==\nAlthough the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry is 6-part standard comprising several hundreds of pages, the primary model is presented in Part-3 and depicted in UML diagrams to facilitate understanding, supported by normative text. The eXtended Metadata Registry initiative, [[XMDR]] led by the US, explored the use of ontologies as the basis for MDR content in order to provide richer semantic framework than could be achieved by lexical and syntax naming conventions alone. The XMDR experimented with a prototype using OWL, RDF and SPARQL to prove the concept. The initiative resulted in Edition 3 of ISO/IEC 11179. The first part published is ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013. The primary extension in Edition 3 is the Concept Region, expanding the use of concepts to more components within the standard, and supporting registration of a Concept system for use within the registry.

It documents the standardization and registration of metadata to make data understandable and shareable.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-39940-9_907 | title=Metadata Registry, ISO/IEC 11179 | access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== Intended purpose ==\nOrganizations exchange data between computer systems precisely using [[enterprise application integration]] technologies. Completed transactions are often transferred to separate data warehouse and [[business rule]]s systems with structures designed to support data for analysis. A de facto standard model for data integration platforms is the [[Common Warehouse Metamodel]] (CWM). Data integration is often also solved as a problem of data, rather than metadata, with the use of so-called [[master data]]. ISO/IEC 11179 claims that it is a standard for metadata-driven exchange of data in an heterogeneous environment, based on exact definitions of data.\n\n== Structure of an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry ==\nThe ISO/IEC 11179 model is a result of two principles of semantic theory, combined with basic principles of data modelling.\n\nThe first principle from semantic theory is the thesaurus type relation between wider and more narrow (or specific) concepts, e.g. the wide concept \"income\" has a relation to the more narrow concept \"net income\".\n\nThe second principle from semantic theory is the relation between a concept and its representation, e.g., \"buy\" and \"purchase\" are the same concept although different terms are used.\n\nA basic principle of data modelling is the combination of an object class and a characteristic. For example, \"Person - hair color\".\n\nWhen applied to data modelling, ISO/IEC 11179 combines a wide \"concept\" with an \"object class\" to form a more specific \"data element concept\". For example, the high-level concept \"income\" is combined with the object class \"person\" to form the data element concept \"net income of person\". Note that \"net income\" is more specific than \"income\".\n\nThe different possible representations of a data element concept are then described with the use of one or more data elements. Differences in representation may be a result of the use of synonyms or different value domains in different data sets in a data holding. A value domain is the permitted range of values for a characteristic of an object class. An example of a value domain for \"sex of person\" is \"M = Male, F = Female, U = Unknown\". The letters M, F and U are then the permitted values of sex of person in a particular data set.\n\nThe data element concept \"monthly net income of person\" may thus have one data element called \"monthly net income of individual by 100 dollar groupings\" and one called \"monthly net income of person range 0-1000 dollars\", etc., depending on the heterogeneity of representation that exists within the data holdings covered by one ISO/IEC 11179 registry. Note that these two examples have different terms for the object class (person/individual) and different value sets (a 0-1000 dollar range as opposed to 100 dollar groupings).\n\nThe result of this is a catalogue of sorts, in which related data element concepts are grouped by a high-level concept and an object class, and data elements grouped by a shared data element concept. Strictly speaking, this is not a hierarchy, even if it resembles one.\n\nISO/IEC 11179 proper does not describe data as it is actually stored. It does not refer to the description of physical files, tables and columns. The ISO/IEC 11179 constructs are \"semantic\" as opposed to \"physical\" or \"technical\".\n\nThe standard has two main purposes: definition and exchange. The core object is the data element concept, since it defines a concept and, ideally, describes data independent of its representation in any one system, table, column or organisation.\n\n== Structure of the ISO/IEC 11179 standard ==\nThe standard consists of seven parts:\n\n* ISO/IEC 11179-1:2015 Framework (referred to as ISO/IEC 11179-1)\n* ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 Classification\n* ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 Registry metamodel and basic attributes\n* ISO/IEC 11179-4:2004 Formulation of data definitions\n* ISO/IEC 11179-5:2015 Naming and identification principles\n* ISO/IEC 11179-6:2015 Registration\n* ISO/IEC 11179-7:2019 Metamodel for data set registration\n\n\nPart 1 explains the purpose of each part. Part 3 specifies the metamodel that defines the registry. Part 7 is released per December 2019 and provides an extension to part 3 for registration of metadata about data sets. The other parts specify various aspects of the use of the registry.\n\n== Overview of 11179 Data Element ==\nThe [[data element]] is foundational concept in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry. The purpose of the registry is to maintain a semantically precise structure of data elements.\n\nEach Data element in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry:\n\n* should be '''registered''' according to the Registration guidelines (11179-6)\n* will be '''uniquely identified''' within the register (11179-5)\n* should be '''named''' according to Naming and Identification Principles (11179-5) See [[data element name]]\n* should be '''defined''' by the Formulation of Data Definitions rules (11179-4) See [[data element definition]] and\n* may be '''classified''' in a Classification Scheme (11179-2) See [[classification scheme]]\n\nData elements that store \"Codes\" or enumerated values must also specify the semantics of each of the code values with precise definitions.\n\n==Adoption of 11179 standards==\n[[Software AG]]'s COTS Metadata Registry (MDR) product supports the ISO 11179 standard and continues to be sold and used for this purpose in both commercial and government applications (see Vendor Tools section below).\n\nWhile commercial adoption is increasing, the spread of ISO/IEC 11179 has been more successful in the public sector. However, the reason for this is unclear. ISO membership is open to organizations through their national bodies.  Countries with public sector repositories across various industries include Australia, Canada, Germany, United States and the United Kingdom. \n\nThe United Nations and the US Government refer to and use the 11179 standards.  11179 is strongly recommended on the U.S. government's [[XML]] website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://xml.fido.gov/ |title=US Government's XML web site |access-date=2020-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215051245/http://xml.fido.gov/ |archive-date=2013-02-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is promoted by [[The Open Group]] as a foundation of the [[Universal Data Element Framework]].<ref>[http://www.opengroup.org/udef/ Universal Data Element Framework]</ref> The Open Group is a [[vendor-neutral]] and technology-neutral [[consortium]] working to enable access to integrated information within and between enterprises based on [[open standard]]s and global [[interoperability]].\n\n==Extensions to the ISO/IEC 11179 standard==\nAlthough the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry is 6-part standard comprising several hundreds of pages, the primary model is presented in Part-3 and depicted in UML diagrams to facilitate understanding, supported by normative text. The eXtended Metadata Registry initiative, [[XMDR]] led by the US, explored the use of ontologies as the basis for MDR content in order to provide richer semantic framework than could be achieved by lexical and syntax naming conventions alone. The XMDR experimented with a prototype using OWL, RDF and SPARQL to prove the concept. The initiative resulted in Edition 3 of ISO/IEC 11179. The first part published is ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013. The primary extension in Edition 3 is the Concept Region, expanding the use of concepts to more components within the standard, and supporting registration of a Concept system for use within the registry. The standard also supports the use of externally defined concept systems. Edition 3 versions of Parts 1, 5, and 6 were published in 2015. Part 2, Classifications, is subsumed by the Concept Region in Part 3, but is being updated to a Technical Report (TR) to provide guidance on the development of Classification Schemes. Part 4 describes principles for forming data definitions; an Edition 3 has not been proposed.\n\n==Examples of ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registries==\nThe following metadata registries state that they follow ISO/IEC 11179 guidelines although there have been no formal third party tests developed to test for metadata registry compliance.\n* [http://www.aristotlemetadata.com Aristotle Metadata Registry ] ([[Open-source software|Open-source]] [[metadata registry]]) - [[Aristotle Metadata Registry|Wikipedia page]]\n* [http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/ Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - Metadata Online Registry (METeOR)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080414002018/http://education.state.mn.us/mde-dd/ Minnesota Department of Education Metadata Registry (K-12 Data)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081212032139/http://proptax.mdor.state.mn.us/mdr Minnesota Department of Revenue Property Taxation (Real Estate Transactions)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111007142001/https://cagrid.org/display/MDR/Home/ Ohio State University - open Metadata Repository (openMDR)]\n* [http://justicexml.gtri.gatech.edu/ US Department of Justice - Global Justice XML Data Model] [[GJXDM]]\n* [http://www.epa.gov/edr/ US Environmental Protection Agency - Environmental Data Registry]\n* [http://ushik.ahrq.gov US Health Information Knowledgebase (USHIK)]\n* [http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR US National Cancer Institute - Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR)]\n* [http://www.niem.gov US National Information Exchange Model] [[NIEM]]\n\n==Metadata registry vendor tools that claim ISO/IEC 11179 compliance==\n* [https://nurocor.com/ Nurocor MDR]\n* [[Software AG|Software AG's OneData Metadata Registry]]\n* [http://www.srdc.com.tr/projects/salus/blog/?p=433] SALUS MDR Project - EU\n* [https://www.softwareag.com/corporate/images/SAG_wM-OneData-MDR_FS_Mar14_tcm16-100062.pdf]\n* [http://aristotlemetadata.com/ Aristotle Metadata Registry (open source registry)]\n\nNo independent agencies certify ISO/IEC 11179 compliance.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Data dictionary]]\n*[[Data reference model]]\n*[[GJXDM|Global Justice XML Data Model]]\n*[[NIEM|National Information Exchange Model]]  \n*[[Representation term]]\n*[[Semantic Web]]\n*[[Universal Data Element Framework]]\n*[[METeOR]]\n*[https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/caDSR/caDSR+Wiki NCI caDSR]\n*[[Metadata standards]]\n*[[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32]]\n*[http://metadata-standards.org/ ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32/WG 2]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [http://metadata-standards.org/ ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee on Metadata Standards Web Site]\n* [http://metadata-standards.org/11179/ 11179 Document List]\n* [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035343_ISO_IEC_11179-1_2004(E).zip ISO/IEC 11179-1:2004 Metadata registries (MDR) - Part 1: Framework]\n* [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035345_ISO_IEC_11179-2_2005(E).zip ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 Metadata registries (MDR) - Part 2: Classification]\n* [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c050340_ISO_IEC_11179-3_2013.zip ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 Metadata registries (MDR) - Part 3: Registry metamodel and basic attributes]\n* [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035346_ISO_IEC_11179-4_2004(E).zip ISO/IEC 11179-4:2004 Metadata registries (MDR) - Part 4: Formulation of data definitions]\n* [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035347_ISO_IEC_11179-5_2005(E).zip ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 Metadata registries (MDR) - Part 5: Naming and identification principles]\n* [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c035348_ISO_IEC_11179-6_2005(E).zip ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 Metadata registries (MDR) - Part 6: Registration]\n* [http://www.ebxml.org/specs/ebCCNAM.pdf Extended Business XML Naming Conventions]\n{{refend}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{List of International Electrotechnical Commission standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:ISO IEC 11179}}\n[[Category:Metadata standards]]\n[[Category:Metadata registry]]\n[[Category:Data modeling languages]]\n[[Category:ISO/IEC standards|#11179]]\n[[Category:ISO/IEC 11179| ]]\n", "name_user": "Gaurav", "label": "safe", "comment": "Improved first line", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_11179"}

A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation. This is done by generating chimeric mice, and exposing the mice HCV infection. This engineering process is known to create humanized mice, and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluating antiviral compounds.<ref

Despite moderate success, current research highlights the need for pre-clinical testing in mammalian systems such as [[mouse]], particularly for the development of vaccines in poorer communities. Currently, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] remain the available living system to study, yet their use has ethical concerns and regulatory restrictions. While scientists have made use of human cell culture systems such as hepatocytes, questions have been raised about their accuracy in reflecting the body's response to infection.<ref name=Sand2013>{{cite journal|last=Sandmann|first=L|author2=Ploss, A|title=Barriers of hepatitis C virus interspecies transmission.|journal=Virology|date=2013-01-05|volume=435|issue=1|pages=70\u201380|pmid=23217617|doi=10.1016/j.virol.2012.09.044|pmc=3523278}}</ref>\n\nOne aspect of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models. A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation. This is done by generating chimeric mice, and exposing the mice HCV infection. This engineering process is known to create humanized mice, and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluating antiviral compounds.<ref name=Sand2013 /> Alternatively, generating inbred mice with susceptibility to HCV would simplify the process of studying mouse models.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical condition classification and resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 5783\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|B|17|1|b|15}}, {{ICD10|B|18|2|b|15}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|070.70}},{{ICD9|070.4}}, {{ICD9|070.5}}\n| OMIM            = 609532\n| MedlinePlus     = 000284\n| eMedicineSubj   = med\n| eMedicineTopic  = 993\n| eMedicine_mult  = {{EMedicine2|ped|979}}\n| MeshID          = D006526\n| SNOMED CT       = 186643004\n}}\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Hep C en.ogg|2014-07-26}}\n{{commons}}\n*{{curlie|Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_Disorders/Liver/Hepatitis/Hepatitis_C|Hepatitis C}}\n* {{cite web|title=Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C|url=http://www.hcvguidelines.org/|website=www.hcvguidelines.org|publisher=IDSA/AASLD|accessdate=28 July 2017}}\n{{Portal bar|Medicine|Viruses}}\n{{Viral diseases}}\n{{gastroenterology}}\n\n[[Category:Hepatitis C| ]]\n[[Category:Healthcare-associated infections]]\n[[Category:Infectious causes of cancer]]\n[[Category:RTT(full)]]\n[[Category:RTTEM]]\n[[Category:Viral diseases]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_C"}

It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016, following the passage of Constitution 101st Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by GST Council and its Chairman is Union Finance Minister of India - Nirmala Sitaraman (working finance minister)\n\nThis method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Administrative responsibility would generally rest with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services. Exports would be considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST.\n\nIntroduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State taxes into a single tax would mitigate cascading or double taxation, facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent.\n\nGST is applicable from 1 July 2017.\n\n== Trust law ==\nTrust law in India is mainly codified in the [[Indian Trusts Act]] of 1882, which came into force on March 1, 1882. It extends to the whole of India except for the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. Indian law follows principles of English law in most areas of law, but the law of trusts is a notable exception. Indian law does not recognise \"double ownership\", and a beneficiary of trust property is not the equitable owner of the property in Indian law.\n\n== Family law \u2013 Personal law ==\n{{Main|Dowry law in India}}\nFamily laws in India are different when [[Warren Hastings]] in 1772 created provisions prescribing Hindu law for Hindus and Islamic law for Muslims, for litigation relating to personal matters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=530}}</ref> However, after independence, efforts have been made to modernise various aspects of personal law and bring about uniformity among various religions. Recent reform has affected custody and guardianship laws, adoption laws, succession law, and laws concerning domestic violence and child marriage.\n\n=== Hindu Law ===\n{{Main|Hindu Personal Law}}\nAs far as Hindus are concerned ''[[Hindu Law]]'' is a specific branch of law. Though the attempt made by the first parliament after independence did not succeed in bringing forth a Hindu Code comprising the entire field of Hindu family law, laws could be enacted touching upon all major areas that affect family life among Hindus in India.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists are also covered by Hindu law\n\n=== Muslim law ===\n{{Main|Muslim Personal Law in India}}\n\n[[Islam in India|Indian Muslims']] personal laws are based upon the [[Sharia]], which is [[Application of Islamic law by country|thus partially applied in India]],<ref>{{harvnb|Fyzee|2008|p=1}}</ref> and laws and legal judgements adapting and adjusting Sharia for Indian society. The portion of the ''[[fiqh]]'' applicable to Indian Muslims as personal law is termed Mohammedan law. Despite being largely uncodified, Mohammedan law has the same legal status as other codified statutes.<ref name=\"Fyzee65\">{{harvnb|Fyzee|2008|p=65}}</ref> The development of the law is largely on the basis of judicial precedent, which in recent times has been subject to review by the courts.<ref name=\"Fyzee65\" /> The concept of the judicial precedent and of 'review by the courts' is a key component of the British [[common law]] upon which Indian law is based. The contribution of Justice [[V.R.

The Indian Divorce (Amendment) Act of 2001 has brought in considerable changes in the grounds available for divorce. By now Christian law in India has emerged as a separate branch of law. It covers the entire spectrum of family law so far as it concerns Christians in India. Christian law, to a great extent is based on English law but there are laws that originated on the strength of customary practices and precedents.\n\nChristian family law has now distinct sub branches like laws on [[Christian Law of Marriage in India|marriage]], divorce, restitution, judicial separation, succession, [[Christian Law of Adoption in India|adoption]], [[Christian Law of Guardianship in India|guardianship]], maintenance, custody of minor children and relevance of [[Canon Law on Marriage in India|canon law]] and all that regulates familial relationship.\n\n== Nationality law ==\n{{Main|Indian nationality law}}\nNationality law or citizenship law is mainly codified in the [[constitution of India]] and the Citizenship Act of 1955. Although the Constitution of India bars [[multiple citizenship]], the [[Parliament of India]] passed on 7 January 2004, a law creating a new form of very limited [[dual nationality]] called ''Overseas Citizenship of India''. Overseas citizens of India have no form of political rights or participation in the government, however, and there are no plans to issue to overseas citizens any form of Indian passport.\nOk\n\n== Law enforcement ==\n{{Main|Law enforcement in India}}\nLaw enforcement in India is undertaken by numerous [[law enforcement agencies]]. Like many [[federation|federal structures]], the nature of the Constitution of India mandates law and order as a subject of the state, therefore the bulk of the policing lies with the respective '''[[States and territories of India|states and territories]]''' of India.\n\nAt the [[Government of India|federal]] level, the many [[Indian Paramilitary Force|agencies]] are part of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, and support the states in their duties. Larger cities also operate [[metropolitan police]] forces, under respective state governments. All senior police officers in the state police forces, as well as those in the federal agencies, are members of the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) and [[Indian Revenue Service]] (IRS), two of the several kinds of civil services. They are recruited by the [[Union Public Service Commission]].\n\n=== Police Force ===\nThe federal police are controlled by the central [[Government of India]]. The majority of federal law enforcement agencies are controlled by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]. The head of each of the federal law enforcement agencies is always an [[Indian Police Service]] officer (IPS). The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing\u2014including apprehension of criminals\u2014is carried out by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organisation by authorising the maintenance of the Indian Police Service. [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) officers are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission through a competitive nationwide examination. On completion of a nationwide basic public-service course, the [[Indian Police Service]] recruits attend the National Police Academy at Hyderabad, Telangana, for training. They are then assigned to particular state or union territory forces, where they usually remain for the rest of their careers. About 50 percent of the officers are regularly assigned to states or territories other than their own in an effort to promote national integration.\n\n== Law reforms ==\nGovernment usually appoints [[Law Commission of India|Law Commission]] panels to study and make non-binding recommendations for the law reform. In first 65 years 1,301 obsolete laws were repealed, including 1029 old laws in 1950 by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and 272 old laws in 2004 by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]. After that 1,824 such laws were repealed by [[Narendra Modi]] government between May 2014 to December 2017, taking the total to 3,125.<ref name=law1>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/62135666.cms Lok Sabha passes 2 bills to repeal 245 archaic laws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225072127/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/62135666.cms |date=25 February 2018 }}, [[The Economic Times]], 19 Dec 2017.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Law|India}}\n* [[History of Indian law]]\n* [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]\n* [[Law enforcement in India]]\n* [[Legal systems of the world]]\n* [[Indian criminal law]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{EB1911 Poster|Indian Law}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=VN Shukla's Constitution of India|first=V.N.|last=Shukla|year=2013|edition=12th|publisher=Eastern Book Company|place=Lucknow|isbn=978-93-5028-982-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Commentary on the Constitution of India|first=Durga Das|last=Basu|year=2007|edition=8th|publisher=Wadhwa & Co|place=Nagpur|isbn=978-81-8038-479-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Outlines of Muhammadan Law|first=Asaf A.A.|last=Fyzee|year=2008|edition=5th|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|place=Delhi|isbn=978-0-19-569169-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Legal Traditions of the World|url=https://archive.org/details/legaltraditionso0000glen|url-access=registration|first=H.

In most states, registering of marriages and divorces is not compulsory. Separate laws govern  [[Hindu]]s including Sikhs, Jain's and Buddhist, [[Muslim]]s, [[Christians]], and followers of other religions. The exception to this rule is in the state of [[Goa]], where a [[uniform civil code]] is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces, and adoption.

In 2010-11, the gross tax collection amounted to {{INR}} 7.92 billion ([[Long scale]]), with direct tax and indirect tax contributing 56% and 44% respectively.<ref name=\"2010-11\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/156269/economic-growth-boosts-indias-tax.html|title=Economic growth boosts India\u2019s tax collection|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]|accessdate=2012-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228195606/http://www.deccanherald.com/content/156269/economic-growth-boosts-indias-tax.html|archive-date=28 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Central Board of Direct Taxes ===\nThe [[Central Board of Direct Taxes]] (CBDT) is a part of the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance, Government of [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/CCIT/CBDT.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118033640/http://incometaxindia.gov.in/CCIT/CBDT.asp |archivedate=18 January 2013 }}</ref> The CBDT provides essential inputs for policy and planning of [[direct taxes]] in India and is also responsible for administration of the direct tax laws through Income Tax Department. The CBDT is a [[statutory authority]] functioning under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. It is India\u2019s official [[FATF]] unit. The Central Board of Revenue as the Department apex body charged with the administration of taxes came into existence as a result of the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1924. Initially the Board was in charge of both direct and indirect taxes. However, when the administration of taxes became too unwieldy for one Board to handle, the Board was split up into two, namely the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Central Board of Excise and Customs with effect from 1 January 1964. This bifurcation was brought about by constitution of the two Boards u/s 3 of the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963.\n\n=== Income Tax Act of 1961 ===\nThe major tax enactment is the ''Income Tax Act '' of 1961 passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], which establishes and governs [[Income Tax in India|the taxation of the incomes]] of individuals and corporations.<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Indian Income Tax Act, 1961\n | url = http://www.helplinelaw.com/docs/Income%20Tax%20Act%20-%201961\n | accessdate = 2009-04-18\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130615020732/http://www.helplinelaw.com/docs/Income%20Tax%20Act%20-%201961\n | archive-date = 15 June 2013\n | url-status = live\n }}</ref> This Act imposes a tax on income under the following five heads:<ref>{{Citation\n |title=Section 14 of Income Tax Act \n |url=http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/TaxmannDit/DispCitation/ShowCit.aspx?fn=http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/DitTaxmann/IncomeTaxActs/2008ITAct/section14.htm \n |accessdate=2009-04-18 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311010208/http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/TaxmannDit/DispCitation/ShowCit.aspx?fn=http%3A%2F%2Flaw.incometaxindia.gov.in%2FDitTaxmann%2FIncomeTaxActs%2F2008ITAct%2Fsection14.htm \n |archivedate=11 March 2009 \n}}</ref>\n*  Income from house and property,\n* Income from business and profession,\n* Income from salaries,\n* Income in the form of Capital gains, and\n* Income from other sources\n\nHowever, this Act may soon be repealed and be replaced with a new Act consolidating the law relating to Income Tax and Wealth Tax, the new proposed legislation is called the [[Direct Taxes Code]] (to become the Direct Taxes Code, Act 2010). Act was referred to Parliamentary standing committee which has submitted its recommendations. Act is expected to be implemented with changes from the Financial Year 2013\u201314.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-16/union-budget/31200773_1_common-identifier-constitution-amendment-bill-pranab-mukherjee | work=The Times Of India | title=Direct Taxes Code Bill: Government keen on early enactment | date=2012-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Goods and Services Tax ===\n[[Goods and Services Tax (India)]] is a comprehensive indirect tax on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services throughout India to replace taxes levied by the central and state governments. It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016, following the passage of Constitution 101st Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by GST Council and its Chairman is Union Finance Minister of India - Nirmala Sitaraman (working finance minister)\n\nThis method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Administrative responsibility would generally rest with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services. Exports would be considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST.\n\nIntroduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State taxes into a single tax would mitigate cascading or double taxation, facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent.\n\nGST is applicable from 1 July 2017.\n\n== Trust law ==\nTrust law in India is mainly codified in the [[Indian Trusts Act]] of 1882, which came into force on March 1, 1882. It extends to the whole of India except for the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. Indian law follows principles of English law in most areas of law, but the law of trusts is a notable exception. Indian law does not recognise \"double ownership\", and a beneficiary of trust property is not the equitable owner of the property in Indian law.\n\n== Family law \u2013 Personal law ==\n{{Main|Dowry law in India}}\nFamily laws in India are different when [[Warren Hastings]] in 1772 created provisions prescribing Hindu law for Hindus and Islamic law for Muslims, for litigation relating to personal matters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jain|2006|p=530}}</ref> However, after independence, efforts have been made to modernise various aspects of personal law and bring about uniformity among various religions. Recent reform has affected custody and guardianship laws, adoption laws, succession law, and laws concerning domestic violence and child marriage.\n\n=== Hindu Law ===\n{{Main|Hindu Personal Law}}\nAs far as Hindus are concerned ''[[Hindu Law]]'' is a specific branch of law. Though the attempt made by the first parliament after independence did not succeed in bringing forth a Hindu Code comprising the entire field of Hindu family law, laws could be enacted touching upon all major areas that affect family life among Hindus in India.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists are also covered by Hindu law\n\n=== Muslim law ===\n{{Main|Muslim Personal Law in India}}\n\n[[Islam in India|Indian Muslims']] personal laws are based upon the [[Sharia]], which is [[Application of Islamic law by country|thus partially applied in India]],<ref>{{harvnb|Fyzee|2008|p=1}}</ref> and laws and legal judgements adapting and adjusting Sharia for Indian society. The portion of the ''[[fiqh]]'' applicable to Indian Muslims as personal law is termed Mohammedan law. Despite being largely uncodified, Mohammedan law has the same legal status as other codified statutes.<ref name=\"Fyzee65\">{{harvnb|Fyzee|2008|p=65}}</ref> The development of the law is largely on the basis of judicial precedent, which in recent times has been subject to review by the courts.<ref name=\"Fyzee65\" /> The concept of the judicial precedent and of 'review by the courts' is a key component of the British [[common law]] upon which Indian law is based. The contribution of Justice [[V.R. Krishna Iyer]] in the matter of interpretation of the statutory as well as personal law is significant.\n\n'''Sunni Law:'''\n* Quran\n* Sunna or Ahdis (Tradition of the Prophet)\n* Ijma (Unanimous Decision of the Jurists)\n* Qiyas ( Analogical deduction)\n\n'''As per Shia Law:'''\n\n'''Usooli Shia up'''\n* Quran\n* Tradition (only those that have come from the family of the Prophet)\n* Ijma (only those confirmed by Imams)\n* Reasons\n\n'''Akhbari Shia'''\n* \n* Tradition (only those that have come from the family of the Prophet)\n\n'''2. \"Secondary Source\"'''\n* C\n* \n* n\n\n[[Polygamy]] and [[Triple Talaq in India|triple talaq]] is a subject of debate from long time.

The Indian Divorce (Amendment) Act of 2001 has brought in considerable changes in the grounds available for divorce. By now Christian law in India has emerged as a separate branch of law. It covers the entire spectrum of family law so far as it concerns Christians in India. Christian law, to a great extent is based on English law but there are laws that originated on the strength of customary practices and precedents.\n\nChristian family law has now distinct sub branches like laws on [[Christian Law of Marriage in India|marriage]], divorce, restitution, judicial separation, succession, [[Christian Law of Adoption in India|adoption]], [[Christian Law of Guardianship in India|guardianship]], maintenance, custody of minor children and relevance of [[Canon Law on Marriage in India|canon law]] and all that regulates familial relationship.\n\n== Nationality law ==\n{{Main|Indian nationality law}}\nNationality law or citizenship law is mainly codified in the [[constitution of India]] and the Citizenship Act of 1955. Although the Constitution of India bars [[multiple citizenship]], the [[Parliament of India]] passed on 7 January 2004, a law creating a new form of very limited [[dual nationality]] called ''Overseas Citizenship of India''. Overseas citizens of India have no form of political rights or participation in the government, however, and there are no plans to issue to overseas citizens any form of Indian passport.\n\n== Law enforcement ==\n{{Main|Law enforcement in India}}\nLaw enforcement in India is undertaken by numerous [[law enforcement agencies]]. Like many [[federation|federal structures]], the nature of the Constitution of India mandates law and order as a subject of the state, therefore the bulk of the policing lies with the respective '''[[States and territories of India|states and territories]]''' of India.\n\nAt the [[Government of India|federal]] level, the many [[Indian Paramilitary Force|agencies]] are part of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, and support the states in their duties. Larger cities also operate [[metropolitan police]] forces, under respective state governments. All senior police officers in the state police forces, as well as those in the federal agencies, are members of the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) and [[Indian Revenue Service]] (IRS), two of the several kinds of civil services. They are recruited by the [[Union Public Service Commission]].\n\n=== Police Force ===\nThe federal police are controlled by the central [[Government of India]]. The majority of federal law enforcement agencies are controlled by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]]. The head of each of the federal law enforcement agencies is always an [[Indian Police Service]] officer (IPS). The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policing\u2014including apprehension of criminals\u2014is carried out by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organisation by authorising the maintenance of the Indian Police Service. [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) officers are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission through a competitive nationwide examination. On completion of a nationwide basic public-service course, the [[Indian Police Service]] recruits attend the National Police Academy at Hyderabad, Telangana, for training. They are then assigned to particular state or union territory forces, where they usually remain for the rest of their careers. About 50 percent of the officers are regularly assigned to states or territories other than their own in an effort to promote national integration.\n\n== Law reforms ==\nGovernment usually appoints [[Law Commission of India|Law Commission]] panels to study and make non-binding recommendations for the law reform. In first 65 years 1,301 obsolete laws were repealed, including 1029 old laws in 1950 by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and 272 old laws in 2004 by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]. After that 1,824 such laws were repealed by [[Narendra Modi]] government between May 2014 to December 2017, taking the total to 3,125.<ref name=law1>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/62135666.cms Lok Sabha passes 2 bills to repeal 245 archaic laws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225072127/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/62135666.cms |date=25 February 2018 }}, [[The Economic Times]], 19 Dec 2017.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Law|India}}\n* [[History of Indian law]]\n* [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]\n* [[Law enforcement in India]]\n* [[Legal systems of the world]]\n* [[Indian criminal law]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{EB1911 Poster|Indian Law}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=VN Shukla's Constitution of India|first=V.N.|last=Shukla|year=2013|edition=12th|publisher=Eastern Book Company|place=Lucknow|isbn=978-93-5028-982-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Commentary on the Constitution of India|first=Durga Das|last=Basu|year=2007|edition=8th|publisher=Wadhwa & Co|place=Nagpur|isbn=978-81-8038-479-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Outlines of Muhammadan Law|first=Asaf A.A.|last=Fyzee|year=2008|edition=5th|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|place=Delhi|isbn=978-0-19-569169-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=Legal Traditions of the World|url=https://archive.org/details/legaltraditionso0000glen|url-access=registration|first=H.

As GD joins them, they get a chance to form a band called \"The Comet\" under the music label company \"Mixx Musix\" owned by Mixx where they release their first single entitled \"No Fear\". After failing Mixx's expectations, he decides to tear up the band's contract. Nott tells Nueng and GD that he would find a way to let Mixx reconsider his decision.\n\nBono, who is Mixx's overprotective girlfriend, catches the attention of Jee when she was collecting several lucky charms. Jee then suggests that they join an online contest to a party where Mixx would be in attendance. Nott also attends the same party where he pleads to Mixx for another chance to prove their worth. Failing to convince Mixx, Nott ends up drinking alone disappointed until he meets Jee. Nott then shares about his misfortunes to Jee until they got drunk and ended up into a one night stand.

He later learns from GD and Nueng that their first single has hit 500,000 views thanks to a song cover from Charm, a rising young actress who has over 4 million followers. With this, Mixx decides to offer them a new contract. Their burst into the spotlight gives the band several media exposures and social media buzz which gets Nott perplexed after a series of lucky streaks in his life recently.\n\nJee on the other hand still can't believe that the one night stand she had with Nott resulted into a luck switch. After going through several unfortunate events, Bono urges Jee to seek advice from a \"5G fortune teller\" named Pam. Pam then tells Jee that her luck has been overshadowed by someone's misfortune.

As GD joins them, they get a chance to form a band called \"The Comet\" under the music label company \"Mixx Musix\" owned by Mixx where they release their first single entitled \"No Fear\". After failing Mixx's expectations, he decides to tear up the band's contract. Nott tells Nueng and GD that he would find a way to let Mixx reconsider his decision.\n\nBono, who is Mixx's overprotective girlfriend, catches the attention of Jee when she was collecting several lucky charms. Jee then suggests that they join an online contest to a party where Mixx would be in attendance. Nott also attends the same party where he pleads to Mixx for another chance to prove their worth. Failing to convince Mixx, Nott ends up drinking alone disappointed until he meets Jee. Nott then shares about his misfortunes to Jee until they got drunk and ended up into a one night stand.

He later learns from GD and Nueng that their first single has hit 500,000 views thanks to a song cover from Charm, a rising young actress who has over 4 million followers. With this, Mixx decides to offer them a new contract. Their burst into the spotlight gives the band several media exposures and social media buzz which gets Nott perplexed after a series of lucky streaks in his life recently.\n\nJee on the other hand still can't believe that the one night stand she had with Nott resulted into a luck switch. After going through several unfortunate events, Bono urges Jee to seek advice from a \"5G fortune teller\" named Pam. Pam then tells Jee that her luck has been overshadowed by someone's misfortune. On their second visit to Pam, Jee later admits that she had a one night stand with Nott. The only way that she can get her luck back was to do the same thing again with Nott.\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|08|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|15|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|22|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|12|29|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|01|12|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|01|19|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|01|26|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|02|02|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|02|09|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = TBA\n| LineColor           = #092a81 \n| TopColor            = \n| RowColor            = \n}}\n}}\n\n== Soundtracks ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Song Title\n!Romanized Title\n!Artist(s)\n!Ref\n|-\n| ''\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e39\u0e42\u0e15''\n| ''Siang Jahk Dao Pluto''\n| [[Perawat Sangpotirat]] (Krist)\n| <ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e39\u0e42\u0e15 Ost.One Night Steal \u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e27\u0e07 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVJISKov_6Y |website=youtube.com |publisher=[[GMMTV]] Records |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| ''\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e01\u0e25\u0e31\u0e27''\n| ''Mai Glua''\n| [[Perawat Sangpotirat]] (Krist)<br>[[Purim Rattanaruangwattana]] (Pluem)<br>[[Harit Cheewagaroon]] (Sing)\n| <ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e01\u0e25\u0e31\u0e27 Ost.One Night Steal \u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e27\u0e07 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swZGWlz2mko |website=youtube.com |publisher=[[GMMTV]] Records |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| ''\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19..\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e21?''\n| ''Bpai Duay Gan Mai''\n| [[Perawat Sangpotirat]] (Krist)<br>[[Purim Rattanaruangwattana]] (Pluem)<br>[[Harit Cheewagaroon]] (Sing)\n| <ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19..\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e21?

He was an officer of the [[North-West Mounted Police]], most famously as head of the Yukon detachment during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], and commanding officer of [[Strathcona's Horse]] during the [[Boer War]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn into a military family at [[Medonte Township]], Upper Canada (now Ontario), he was the son of Royal Navy Captain The Hon. [[Elmes Yelverton Steele]], a veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and one of six brothers to have served in the [[British Armed Forces]]. His mother (the second wife of his father), Anne Macdonald, was the youngest daughter of Neil Maclain [[MacDonald of Ardnamurchan]], a native of [[Islay]]. Neil MacDonald was a grandson of Captain Godfrey [[MacNeil of Barra]], and a nephew of Colonel Donald MacNeil.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/medontepioneerhi00nporuoft#page/n1/mode/2up A Medonte Pioneer and his Famous Son, Orillia Historical Society]</ref> Sam Steele was named for his father's uncle, Colonel Samuel Steele, who served in [[Quebec]] under [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Amherst]].<ref>Ontario Historical Society, Volumes 32-35</ref> Sam Steele received his education at the family home, Purbrook, and then at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]]. By the age of thirteen he was orphaned, and went to live with his elder half-brother, John Steele.\n\n==Early military career==\nFollowing his family's military tradition, in 1866 Steele joined the military during the [[Fenian raids]]. Steele also participated in the [[Wolseley Expedition|Red River Expedition]] in 1870 to fight the [[Red River Rebellion]] of [[Louis Riel]]. Much to his disappointment, he arrived after the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] had surrendered. The following year he joined the Permanent Force artillery, Canada's first regular army unit. Steele had long been fascinated by the West, devouring the works of [[James Fenimore Cooper]] in his youth. He was especially interested in the [[First Nations land]], and spent his time in the West learning from them and the M\u00e9tis. However, he was assigned to [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], for the next few years, as an instructor at the Artillery School. In 1874, Steele was initiated as a [[Freemason]] in the Lisgar Lodge No. 2, in [[Selkirk, Manitoba]].\n\n== Life as a Mountie ==\n\nIn 1873, Steele was the third officer sworn into the newly formed [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP), entering as a staff constable. He was one of the officers to lead the new recruits of the NWMP on the 1874 [[March West]], when he returned to Fort Garry, present-day [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. To him fell the rank of staff sergeant major and the responsibility\u2014as an accomplished horseman and man-at-arms\u2014of drilling the new recruits. In 1878, Steele was given his own command at [[Fort Qu'Appelle]], [[North-West Territories]].\n\nIn 1877, he was assigned to meet with [[Sitting Bull]], who, having defeated Lieutenant-Colonel [[George Custer]] at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]], had moved with his people into Canada to escape American vengeance. Steele along with U.S. Army General [[Alfred Howe Terry]] attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Sitting Bull to return to the United States. (Most of the Sioux did return a few years later.)\n\nDuring the [[North-West Rebellion]] Steele was dispatched with a small force. Missing the [[Battle of Batoche]] the Mounties were sent to move against the last rebel force led by [[Big Bear]]. He was present at the [[Battle of Frenchman's Butte]], where Big Bear's warriors defeated the Canadian forces under General [[Thomas Bland Strange]]. Two weeks later, Steele and his two dozen Mounties defeated Big Bear's force at [[Battle of Loon Lake|Loon Lake]], [[District of Saskatchewan]], in the last battle fought on Canadian territory. The contributions of the NWMP in putting down the rebellion went largely ignored and unrewarded, to Steele's great annoyance. By 1885, Steele held the rank of superintendent. He established an NWMP station in the town of Galbraiths Ferry, which was later named to [[Fort Steele]] in British Columbia, after Steele solved a murder in the town. He then moved on to [[Fort Macleod]], [[District of Alberta]], in 1888.\n\nIn 1889, at Fort Macleod, he met Marie-Elizabeth de Lotbini\u00e8re-Harwood (1859\u20131951), daughter of [[Robert William Harwood]]. They were married at [[Vaudreuil-Dorion|Vaudreuil]], [[Quebec]], in 1890. They had three children, including [[Harwood Steele]], who fictionalized episodes from his father's life in novels such as ''[[Spirit-of-Iron]]'' (1929).\n\nThe discovery of gold in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] in the late 1890s presented Steele with a new challenge. Although he campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of assistant commissioner in 1892, in January 1898 he was sent to succeed [[Charles Constantine]] as commissioner and to establish customs posts at the head of the [[White Pass|White]] and [[Chilkoot Pass]]es, and at Lake Bennett. He was noted for his hard line with the hundreds of unruly and independent-minded prospectors, many of them American.  To help control the situation, he established the rule that no one would be allowed to enter the Yukon without a ton of goods to support themselves, thus preventing the entry of desperate and potentially unruly speculators and adventurers.\n\nSteele and his force made the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] one of the most orderly of its kind in history and made the NWMP famous around the world, which ensured its survival at a critical time when the force's dissolution was being debated in Parliament.  By July 1898, Steele commanded all the NWMP in the Yukon area, and was a member of the territorial council. As the force reported directly to Ottawa, Steele had almost free rein to run things as he chose, always with an eye towards maintaining law, order and Canadian sovereignty. He moved to [[Dawson City]] in September 1898.\n\n== Boer War and second military career ==\nAlways a soldier, in early 1900 Steele leapt at the offer of Canadian Pacific Railway tycoon [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith, Baron Strathcona]] to be the first commanding officer of Smith's privately raised cavalry unit, [[Strathcona's Horse]], with the appointment as [[Lieutenant colonel (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant-colonel]] from 7 March 1900.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27171 |page=1524 |date=6 March 1900}}</ref> This Canadian [[light cavalry]] unit, in British Imperial service, was sent to South Africa during the [[Second Boer War]], where Steele commanded them with distinction in the role of reconnaissance scouts.  Steele, however, apparently disliked greatly {{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=Disliked what he was asked to do but served with distinction and returned the following year. Sources for his personal feeling about the Boer War please.}}what he was ordered to do by the British, which included burning towns, farms and homesteads, killing livestock of the Boer families and moving the populace to [[concentration camp]]s.  After the war, the regiment arrived in London in February 1901. Here they met Lord Strathcona for the first time and were presented with medals by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] during a visit to Buckingham Palace. Steele was also appointed a [[Royal Victorian Order|Member of the Royal Victorian Order (fourth class)]] (MVO), a personal gift from the King.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27292 |date=8 March 1901 |page=1648}}</ref> On its return to Canada the regiment was disbanded, and the officers received honorary promotions. Steele was promoted to honorary lieutenant-colonel in March 1901.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27357 |date=20 September 1901 |page=6173}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking the unit back to Canada early in 1901, Steele returned to South Africa that same year to command 'B' Division of the [[South African Constabulary]], a position he held until 1906. On his return to Canada in 1907, Steele assumed command of Military Division No. 13 in Alberta and the [[District of Mackenzie]], and then in 1910 assumed command of Division No. 10 at Winnipeg, where he spent his time regrouping Lord Strathcona's Horse and in preparing his memoirs.\n\nSteele requested active military duty upon the outbreak of the First World War. He was initially rejected for command on the grounds of age. However, a compromise was reached which allowed him to act as commander of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] until the unit was sent to France, whereupon he would be replaced. After accompanying the division to England, Steele was offered an administrative post as commanding officer of the South-East District.\n\nMatters were complicated, however, when Canadian Minister of Defence [[Samuel Hughes]] insisted that Steele also be made commander of all Canadian troops in Europe\u2014a slight problem, as there were two brigadiers-general who each believed the Canadian command was theirs. The issue was not resolved until 1916, when the new Minister of Overseas Military Forces of Canada, Sir [[G. H. Perley]], removed Steele from his Canadian command after Steele refused to return to Canada as a recruiter. He kept his British command until his retirement on 15 July 1918. While in Britain, Steele was knighted, on 1 January 1918, and was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath|Most Honourable Order of the Bath]], and Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George|Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George]]. Steele died during the [[1918 flu pandemic]] just after his 70th birthday and was later buried in Winnipeg.\n\nCanada's fifth-tallest mountain, [[Mount Steele]], is named after him.\n\n[[CFB Edmonton]], the home of [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] is now called Steele Barracks after Major General Steele.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lfwa/Documents/Backgrounders/BG-steele_barracks.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123175204/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lfwa/Documents/Backgrounders/BG-steele_barracks.PDF |archivedate=23 November 2003 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Personal papers==\nOn 19 June 2008, Steele's wealth of personal papers and writings were repatriated to Canada in a ceremony in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London, England]], headed by the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].\n\nSteele's papers, believed by historians to contain a wealth of heretofore untold stories that would \"re-write Canadian history\" had been held by British descendants of Steele, and were returned to Canada via a [[C$]]1.8MM purchase by the [[University of Alberta]].<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=28d56906-9803-41c4-980e-e98ca734ed60 Personal papers of famous Mountie shed light on young Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104131625/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=28d56906-9803-41c4-980e-e98ca734ed60 |date=4 November 2012 }} 19 June 2008 [[Canada.com]]</ref>\n\n==Fictional references==\nHector Adair, a character in the novel ''Spirit-of-Iron'' (1923), written by Steele's son, Harwood Steele, is thought to have been modelled on the famous Mountie. The novel includes a foreword in which the author writes: \"Hector Adair is intended to represent the ideal Mounted Police officer in particular and the British officer generally. He is not to be identified with any historical figure connected with the Force.\"\n\nPlayers meet Sam Steele in the 1994 computer simulation game ''[[The Yukon Trail]]''.\n\nIn [[James A. Michener|James Michener's]] ''[[Alaska (novel)|Alaska]]'', \"Major Sam Steele\" is the face of the NWMP. Michener acknowledges him as a historical figure in the notes at the start of the book, but the veracity of his claimed actions is unknown.\n\nSteele is also portrayed, along with [[Jack London]], in [[Don Rosa]]'s [[Walt Disney]] comic book ''[[Hearts of the Yukon]]'', episode 8C from ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''.\n\n[[Lorne Greene]] portrayed Steele in the 1980 film ''[[Klondike Fever]]''.\n\nIn the ''[[Due South]]'' episode \"[[List of Due South episodes#Season 2: 1995\u201396|North]]\" from 1995, Fraser references Sam Steele as having been very proud of never firing his weapon while patrolling the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn several of the short stories James B. Hendryx wrote about the Yukon Gold Rush, Sam Steele is in the background. Usually Steele is investigating a crime.  (\"Left Handed Justice\", \"Short Stories\" January 1950 issue)\n\nHe was featured in \"[[List of The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures episodes#Season 1 (1998)|The Klondike Mice]]\" episode of ''[[The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures]]'' in 1998.\n\nSteele appears in \"[[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 5 (2012)|Murdoch of the Klondike]]\", a 2012 episode of Canadian historical crime drama ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'', portrayed by Matt Cooke.\n\nSteele appears in the [[Discovery Channel]] miniseries ''[[Klondike (miniseries)|Klondike]]'', portrayed by [[Marton Csokas]]. He is never referred to by name in the miniseries and only known as \"the Superintendent\".\n\nSteele is portrayed by Steve Wall in the [[TG4]] series ''[[An Klondike]]'', which depicts him the fictional town of Dominion Creek and being in a relationship with Kate Mulryan, a fictional [[Irish people|Irish]] saloon singer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Pierre Berton]], ''The Wild Frontier, More Tales from the Remarkable Past'' (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1978), chapter 3.\n*[[Brian Busby]], ''Character Parts: Who's Really Who in CanLit'' (Toronto: Knopf Canada, 2003), p.&nbsp;8-9, 54\u201355.\n*R.

In 1874, Steele was initiated as a [[Freemason]] in the Lisgar Lodge No. 2, in [[Selkirk, Manitoba]].\n\n== Life as a Mountie ==\n\nIn 1873, Steele was the third officer sworn into the newly formed [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP), entering as a staff constable. He was one of the officers to lead the new recruits of the NWMP on the 1874 [[March West]], when he returned to Fort Garry, present-day [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. To him fell the rank of staff sergeant major and the responsibility\u2014as an accomplished horseman and man-at-arms\u2014of drilling the new recruits. In 1878, Steele was given his own command at [[Fort Qu'Appelle]], [[North-West Territories]].\n\nIn 1877, he was assigned to meet with [[Sitting Bull]], who, having defeated Lieutenant-Colonel [[George Custer]] at the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Bighorn]], had moved with his people into Canada to escape American vengeance. Steele along with U.S. Army General [[Alfred Howe Terry]] attempted unsuccessfully to persuade Sitting Bull to return to the United States. (Most of the Sioux did return a few years later.)\n\nDuring the [[North-West Rebellion]] Steele was dispatched with a small force. Missing the [[Battle of Batoche]] the Mounties were sent to move against the last rebel force led by [[Big Bear]]. He was present at the [[Battle of Frenchman's Butte]], where Big Bear's warriors defeated the Canadian forces under General [[Thomas Bland Strange]]. Two weeks later, Steele and his two dozen Mounties defeated Big Bear's force at [[Battle of Loon Lake|Loon Lake]], [[District of Saskatchewan]], in the last battle fought on Canadian territory. The contributions of the NWMP in putting down the rebellion went largely ignored and unrewarded, to Steele's great annoyance. By 1885, Steele held the rank of superintendent. He established an NWMP station in the town of Galbraiths Ferry, which was later named to [[Fort Steele]] in British Columbia, after Steele solved a murder in the town. He then moved on to [[Fort Macleod]], [[District of Alberta]], in 1888.\n\nIn 1889, at Fort Macleod, he met Marie-Elizabeth de Lotbini\u00e8re-Harwood (1859\u20131951), daughter of [[Robert William Harwood]]. They were married at [[Vaudreuil-Dorion|Vaudreuil]], [[Quebec]], in 1890. They had three children, including [[Harwood Steele]], who fictionalized episodes from his father's life in novels such as ''[[Spirit-of-Iron]]'' (1929).\n\nThe discovery of gold in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] in the late 1890s presented Steele with a new challenge. Although he campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of assistant commissioner in 1892, in January 1898 he was sent to succeed [[Charles Constantine]] as commissioner and to establish customs posts at the head of the [[White Pass|White]] and [[Chilkoot Pass]]es, and at Lake Bennett. He was noted for his hard line with the hundreds of unruly and independent-minded prospectors, many of them American.  To help control the situation, he established the rule that no one would be allowed to enter the Yukon without a ton of goods to support themselves, thus preventing the entry of desperate and potentially unruly speculators and adventurers.\n\nSteele and his force made the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] one of the most orderly of its kind in history and made the NWMP famous around the world, which ensured its survival at a critical time when the force's dissolution was being debated in Parliament.  By July 1898, Steele commanded all the NWMP in the Yukon area, and was a member of the territorial council. As the force reported directly to Ottawa, Steele had almost free rein to run things as he chose, always with an eye towards maintaining law, order and Canadian sovereignty. He moved to [[Dawson City]] in September 1898.\n\n== Boer War and second military career ==\nAlways a soldier, in early 1900 Steele leapt at the offer of Canadian Pacific Railway tycoon [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith, Baron Strathcona]] to be the first commanding officer of Smith's privately raised cavalry unit, [[Strathcona's Horse]], with the appointment as [[Lieutenant colonel (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant-colonel]] from 7 March 1900.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27171 |page=1524 |date=6 March 1900}}</ref> This Canadian [[light cavalry]] unit, in British Imperial service, was sent to South Africa during the [[Second Boer War]], where Steele commanded them with distinction in the role of reconnaissance scouts.  Steele, however, apparently disliked greatly {{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=Disliked what he was asked to do but served with distinction and returned the following year. Sources for his personal feeling about the Boer War please.}}what he was ordered to do by the British, which included burning towns, farms and homesteads, killing livestock of the Boer families and moving the populace to [[concentration camp]]s.  After the war, the regiment arrived in London in February 1901. Here they met Lord Strathcona for the first time and were presented with medals by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] during a visit to Buckingham Palace. Steele was also appointed a [[Royal Victorian Order|Member of the Royal Victorian Order (fourth class)]] (MVO), a personal gift from the King.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27292 |date=8 March 1901 |page=1648}}</ref> On its return to Canada the regiment was disbanded, and the officers received honorary promotions. Steele was promoted to honorary lieutenant-colonel in March 1901.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27357 |date=20 September 1901 |page=6173}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking the unit back to Canada early in 1901, Steele returned to South Africa that same year to command 'B' Division of the [[South African Constabulary]], a position he held until 1906. On his return to Canada in 1907, Steele assumed command of Military Division No. 13 in Alberta and the [[District of Mackenzie]], and then in 1910 assumed command of Division No. 10 at Winnipeg, where he spent his time regrouping Lord Strathcona's Horse and in preparing his memoirs.\n\nSteele requested active military duty upon the outbreak of the First World War. He was initially rejected for command on the grounds of age. However, a compromise was reached which allowed him to act as commander of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] until the unit was sent to France, whereupon he would be replaced. After accompanying the division to England, Steele was offered an administrative post as commanding officer of the South-East District.\n\nMatters were complicated, however, when Canadian Minister of Defence [[Samuel Hughes]] insisted that Steele also be made commander of all Canadian troops in Europe\u2014a slight problem, as there were two brigadiers-general who each believed the Canadian command was theirs. The issue was not resolved until 1916, when the new Minister of Overseas Military Forces of Canada, Sir [[G. H. Perley]], removed Steele from his Canadian command after Steele refused to return to Canada as a recruiter. He kept his British command until his retirement on 15 July 1918. While in Britain, Steele was knighted, on 1 January 1918, and was made a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath|Most Honourable Order of the Bath]], and Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George|Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George]]. Steele died during the [[1918 flu pandemic]] just after his 70th birthday and was later buried in Winnipeg.\n\nCanada's fifth-tallest mountain, [[Mount Steele]], is named after him.\n\n[[CFB Edmonton]], the home of [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]] is now called Steele Barracks after Major General Steele.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lfwa/Documents/Backgrounders/BG-steele_barracks.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123175204/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/lfwa/Documents/Backgrounders/BG-steele_barracks.PDF |archivedate=23 November 2003 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Personal papers==\nOn 19 June 2008, Steele's wealth of personal papers and writings were repatriated to Canada in a ceremony in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London, England]], headed by the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].\n\nSteele's papers, believed by historians to contain a wealth of heretofore untold stories that would \"re-write Canadian history\" had been held by British descendants of Steele, and were returned to Canada via a [[C$]]1.8MM purchase by the [[University of Alberta]].<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=28d56906-9803-41c4-980e-e98ca734ed60 Personal papers of famous Mountie shed light on young Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104131625/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=28d56906-9803-41c4-980e-e98ca734ed60 |date=4 November 2012 }} 19 June 2008 [[Canada.com]]</ref>\n\n==Fictional references==\nHector Adair, a character in the novel ''Spirit-of-Iron'' (1923), written by Steele's son, Harwood Steele, is thought to have been modelled on the famous Mountie. The novel includes a foreword in which the author writes: \"Hector Adair is intended to represent the ideal Mounted Police officer in particular and the British officer generally. He is not to be identified with any historical figure connected with the Force.\"\n\nPlayers meet Sam Steele in the 1994 computer simulation game ''[[The Yukon Trail]]''.\n\nIn [[James A. Michener|James Michener's]] ''[[Alaska (novel)|Alaska]]'', \"Major Sam Steele\" is the face of the NWMP. Michener acknowledges him as a historical figure in the notes at the start of the book, but the veracity of his claimed actions is unknown.\n\nSteele is also portrayed, along with [[Jack London]], in [[Don Rosa]]'s [[Walt Disney]] comic book ''[[Hearts of the Yukon]]'', episode 8C from ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''.\n\n[[Lorne Greene]] portrayed Steele in the 1980 film ''[[Klondike Fever]]''.\n\nIn the ''[[Due South]]'' episode \"[[List of Due South episodes#Season 2: 1995\u201396|North]]\" from 1995, Fraser references Sam Steele as having been very proud of never firing his weapon while patrolling the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn several of the short stories James B. Hendryx wrote about the Yukon Gold Rush, Sam Steele is in the background. Usually Steele is investigating a crime.  (\"Left Handed Justice\", \"Short Stories\" January 1950 issue)\n\nHe was featured in \"[[List of The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures episodes#Season 1 (1998)|The Klondike Mice]]\" episode of ''[[The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Adventures]]'' in 1998.\n\nSteele appears in \"[[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 5 (2012)|Murdoch of the Klondike]]\", a 2012 episode of Canadian historical crime drama ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'', portrayed by Matt Cooke.\n\nSteele appears in the [[Discovery Channel]] miniseries ''[[Klondike (miniseries)|Klondike]]'', portrayed by [[Marton Csokas]]. He is never referred to by name in the miniseries and only known as \"the Superintendent\".\n\nSteele is portrayed by Steve Wall in the [[TG4]] series ''[[An Klondike]]'', which depicts him the fictional town of Dominion Creek and being in a relationship with Kate Mulryan, a fictional [[Irish people|Irish]] saloon singer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Pierre Berton]], ''The Wild Frontier, More Tales from the Remarkable Past'' (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1978), chapter 3.\n*[[Brian Busby]], ''Character Parts: Who's Really Who in CanLit'' (Toronto: Knopf Canada, 2003), p.&nbsp;8-9, 54\u201355.\n*R.

Since 1940, when its isolationist sentiment drove voters to [[Wendell Willkie]], Logan has become a strongly Republican county. No Democratic Presidential candidate has won Logan County since [[Lyndon Johnson]]\u2019s 1964 landslide over [[Barry Goldwater]].

It was the last Rolling Stones album for guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] and the songwriting and recording of the album's title track had a connection to Taylor's eventual replacement, [[Ronnie Wood]]. The album also marked the 10th anniversary since the release of the band's debut album, [[The Rolling Stones (album)|''The Rolling Stones'']]. ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' combines the core [[British blues|blues]] and [[rock 'n' roll]]-oriented sound with elements of [[funk]] and [[reggae]].<ref name=\"Rivadavia\">{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rolling-stones-its-only-rock-n-roll/|title=How the Rolling Stones Returned to the Fundamentals on 'It's Only Rock 'n' Roll'|first=Eduardo|last=Rivadavia|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' reached number one in the United States and number two in the UK.\n\nThough it wasn't as successful as their prior albums, ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' was an important transitional album for the Rolling Stones.  Long-time producer [[Jimmy Miller]] was out, and the album was self-produced by guitarist [[Keith Richards]] and singer [[Mick Jagger]] under the pseudonym \"[[The Glimmer Twins]]\".  Guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] missed the initial recording sessions with health problems, and ended up quitting the Rolling Stones a few months after the album's release.  The rest of the instrumentation included bassist [[Bill Wyman]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]], as well as frequent collaborators [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], [[Nicky Hopkins]], and [[Billy Preston]], and featured the first appearance of percussionist [[Ray Cooper]], who would continue to work with the Rolling Stones into the 1980s.\n\nThe [[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)|title track]] bears special note as it was recorded separately from the rest of the album.  The basic rhythm track had been laid down by members of the [[Faces (band)|Faces]], including rhythm guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]] and drummer [[Kenney Jones]], during a jam session with Mick Jagger, [[David Bowie]], and bassist [[Willie Weeks]].  Jagger liked the song so much, he brought the basic track to Richards, who added some guitar overdubs, and after some polishing, was put on the album as-is.  After Taylor left the Rolling Stones at the end of 1974, the band would approach Wood to become a full-time member.\n\n==History==\nWork began on ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' following the Rolling Stones' autumn [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European tour]]. Production began in November at [[Munich]], [[Germany]]'s [[Musicland Studios]]. According to guitarist [[Keith Richards]], \"We were really hot (off the road) and ready just to play some new material.\"<ref name=\"RS 175\">{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=Making The Stones' New Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/making-the-stones-new-album-19741205|work=Rolling Stone Magazine No. 175|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=5 December 1974}}</ref> The recording sessions were attended by Belgian painter [[Guy Peellaert]], who [[Mick Jagger]] invited to do the album cover after seeing his work in the book ''Rock Dreams'', which featured illustrations of various rock musicians such as the Stones. Peellaert eventually painted the band as \"rock deities,\" descending a temple staircase, surrounded by young girls and women worshiping them in [[Clothing in ancient Greece|Grecian clothing]]. The artist refused to sign a deal of exclusivity, and in 1974 provided the album art for [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''.<ref>[https://www.athenaart.com/its-only-rock-n-roll.html IT'S ONLY ROCK N ROLL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022141152/https://www.athenaart.com/its-only-rock-n-roll.html |date=22 October 2016 }}, Athena Art</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Mammoth Book of the Rolling Stones: An anthology of the best writing about the greatest rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band in the world\n|first=Sean|last=Egan|page=182|publisher=Hachette|year=2013|ISBN=1-78033-647-0}}</ref>\n\n===Recording===\nThe album was at first developed as a half-live, half-studio production with one side of the album featuring live performances from the Stones' European tour while the other side was to be composed of newly recorded cover versions of the band's favourite [[R&B]] songs. Covers recorded included a take of [[Dobie Gray]]'s \"[[Drift Away]]\", [[Jimmy Reed]]'s \"Shame Shame Shame,\u201d and [[The Temptations]]' \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]].\" Soon the band began working off riffs by Richards and new ideas by [[Mick Jagger]] and the original concept was scrapped in favour of an album with all-new material. The cover of \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" was the only recording to make the cut, while the \"Drift Away\" cover is a popular [[bootleg recording|bootleg]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stadler |first1=Gustavus |title=Cover Art |url=http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2013/06/25/cover-art/ |website=Avidly |accessdate=23 April 2019 |date=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' marked the Stones' first effort in the producer's chair since ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', and the first for Jagger and Richards under their pseudonym \"[[The Glimmer Twins]].\" On the choice to produce, Richards said at the time:\n\n<blockquote>\"I think we'd come to a point with [[Jimmy Miller|Jimmy (Miller)]] where the contribution level had dropped because it'd got to be a habit, a way of life, for Jimmy to do one Stones album a year. He'd got over the initial sort of excitement which you can feel on ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' and ''[[Let It Bleed]]''. Also, Mick and I felt that we wanted to try and do it ourselves because we really felt we knew much more about techniques and recording and had our own ideas of how we wanted things to go. ''Goats Head Soup'' hadn't turned out as we wanted to \u2013 not blaming Jimmy or anything like that... But it was obvious that it was time for a change in that particular part of the process of making records.\"<ref name=\"RS 175\" /></blockquote>\n\nStarting with this release, all future Rolling Stones albums would either be produced by themselves or in collaboration with an outside producer.\n\nMost of the album's backing tracks were recorded first at Musicland; solo vocals were recorded later by Jagger, about whom Richards would say, \"he often comes up with his best stuff alone in the studio with just an engineer.\"<ref name=\"RS 175\" />\n\nThe song \"Luxury\" showed the band's growing interest in [[reggae]] music, while \"[[Till the Next Goodbye]]\" and \"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\" continued their immersion in [[ballad]]s. Seven of the album's 10 songs crack the four-minute mark, a feature that would come to be disparaged during the rising [[punk rock]] scene of the late 1970s.\n\n[[Ronnie Wood]], a long-time acquaintance of the band, began to get closer to the Rolling Stones during these sessions after he invited Mick Taylor to play on his debut album, ''[[I've Got My Own Album to Do]]''. Taylor spent some time recording and hanging out at Wood's house [[The Wick]]. By chance, Richards was asked one night by Wood's wife at the time, Krissy, to join them at the guitarist's home.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} While there, Richards recorded some tracks with Wood and quickly developed a close friendship, with Richards going as far as moving into Wood's guest room.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Jagger soon entered the mix and it was here that the album's lead single and title track, \"[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)]]\", was first recorded. Wood worked closely on the track with Jagger, who subsequently took the song and title for their album. The released version of this song features Wood on 12-string acoustic guitar.\n\n''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' was Mick Taylor's last album with the Rolling Stones, and he played on just seven of the 10 tracks (he did not play on tracks 2, 3 or 6).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSimilar to receiving no writing credits on the Stones' previous album, ''Goats Head Soup'', Taylor reportedly had made songwriting contributions to \"Till the Next Goodbye\" and \"[[Time Waits for No One (song)|Time Waits for No One]],\" but on the album jacket, all original songs were credited to Jagger/Richards. Taylor said in 1997:\n\n<blockquote>\"I did have a falling out with Mick Jagger over some songs I felt I should have been credited with co-writing on ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll''. We were quite close friends and co-operated quite closely on getting that album made. By that time Mick and Keith weren't really working together as a team so I'd spend a lot of time in the studio.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bungey|first=John|title=Hello Goodbye|url=http://www.micktaylorwemissyou.com/mojo.html|work=Issue 48|publisher=Mojo Magazine|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=November 1997}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTaylor's statement contradicts Jagger's earlier comment concerning the album. Jagger stated in a 1995 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview about \"Time Waits for No One\" that Taylor \"maybe threw in a couple of chords.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlongside the usual outside contributors, namely [[Billy Preston]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and unofficial member [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], [[Elton John]] sideman [[Ray Cooper]] acted as percussionist for the album. Several songs were finished songs and overdubs and mixing were performed at Jagger's home, [[Stargroves]], in the early summer of 1974.\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r16838|pure_url=yes}} link]</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2score = B<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=rolling+stone|title=Robert Christgau: CG: rolling stone|website=www.robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[D\u017euboks]]''\n|rev3score = (unfavourable)<ref name=\"dzuboks\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|title=It's Only Rock 'n Roll|journal=D\u017euboks|publisher=De\u010dje novine|location=Gornji Milanovac|issue=5 (second series)|page=23|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[The Great Rock Discography]]''\n|rev4Score = 6/10<ref name=\"OnlyR'n'R/Acclaimed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A324.htm|title=The Rolling Stones ''It's Only Rock 'n' Roll''|publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]|accessdate=15 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127214917/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A324.htm|archive-date=27 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|rev5 = [[MusicHound]]\n|rev5score = 3/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/952 952]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/952}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n|rev6Score = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7911448&style=music |title=The Rolling Stones \u2013 It's Only Rock 'n' Roll CD|publisher=[[CD Universe]]/[[Muze]]|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110412195111/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-rolling-stones/albumguide \"The Rolling Stones: Album Guide\"].

Despite the familiar sound, it surprised many by failing to reach the top 10 in the United States (although it did reach the top 10 in the UK). With its sing-along chorus, it has become a staple at Rolling Stones concerts. The B-side \"Through the Lonely Nights\" dates back to the previous year's ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' sessions. A cover of \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg,\" originally a 1966 hit by [[The Temptations]], was released as the second single in the United States only, where it also became a top 20 hit. Its parent album appeared in October with brisk initial sales, reaching number two in the UK (breaking a string of number-one albums that stretched back to 1969's ''[[Let It Bleed]]'') and number one in the United States, where it eventually went platinum.\n\nReviews were largely positive, with [[Jon Landau]] calling ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'' \"one of the most intriguing and mysterious, as well as the darkest, of all Rolling Stones records.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Landau|first=John|title=The Rolling Stones / It's Only Rock 'n Roll|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/its-only-rock-n-roll-19741219|work=Rolling Stone Magazine No. 172|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=16 October 1974}}</ref> However rock critic [[Lester Bangs]] disparaged the album in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', much like ''Goats Head Soup'', saying, \"The Stones have become oblique in their old age, which is just another word for perverse except that perverse is the corniest concept extant as they realized at inception... ''Soup'' was friendly and safe. I want the edge and this album doesn't reassure me that I'll get it, what a curious situation to be stuck in, but maybe that's the beauty of the Stones, hah, hah, kid? This album is false. Numb. But it cuts like a dull blade. Are they doing the cutting, or are we?\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bangs|first=Lester|title=It's Only the Rolling Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEeovH2wN9kC&pg=PA156|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=31 October 1974}}</ref>\n\nAuthor James Hector added that ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'' was a definitive turning point for the band. \"The album marked the band\u2019s decisive entry into a comfortable living as rock's elder statesmen. From this point on, their youth culture importance vanished, and there would be few musical surprises in the future.\" Hector concluded with \"On ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'', the band had become what they imagined their mass audience desired them to be. They were wrong.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Hector | first = James | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = The Complete Guide to the Music of The Rolling Stones| publisher =Omnibus Press | year = 1995 | location = London, England | pages = 95 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7119-4303-6}}</ref>\n\nInstead of immediately touring to promote the album, the band decided to head back into the Munich studios to record the next album, to Mick Taylor's disappointment and subsequent resignation from the band.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} A tour didn't happen until the following summer in the United States, the \u2018[[Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75|Tour of the Americas '75]]\u2019, with future member Ronnie Wood taking Taylor's place on guitar.\n\nThe title track became a permanent staple of the band's live setlist, but apart from some performances of \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\" and \"If You Can\u2019t Rock Me\" on the [[Licks Tour]], none of the other tracks have been performed since 1977. As of 2006, \"Till The Next Goodbye,\" \"Time Waits For No-One,\" \"If You Really Want To Be My Friend\" and \"Short and Curlies\" had never been played live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksoff.org/debuts.htm|title=ROCKS OFF SETLISTS|website=www.rocksoff.org}}</ref>\n\nIn order to promote the album, music videos were filmed for several of the songs. The most commonly seen video from the album was the one for \"It\u2019s Only Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll (But I Like It),\" featuring the band (in sailor suits) playing in a tent, which gradually fills with soap bubbles (Taylor is featured in the video but did not actually play on the recorded cut). Videos were also filmed for \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\" and \"Till The Next Goodbye.\"\n\nIn 1994, ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'' was remastered and reissued by [[Virgin Records]], in 2009 by [[Universal Music]], and once more in 2011 by [[Universal Music Enterprises]] in a Japanese-only SHM-[[Super Audio CD|SACD]] version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector's Edition CD, which replicated in miniature elements of the original vinyl album packaging.\n\nTwo different versions of \"Luxury\" exist. A shorter version (4:30) is included on the early CD version from 1986, while the 5:01 version was originally released on vinyl in Europe, and on the 1994 and 2009 CD remasters. The difference is the shorter version starts the fadeout 30 seconds earlier, and thereby missing the short guitar solo at the end.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Tracklist\n| all_writing = [[Jagger/Richards|Mick Jagger and Keith Richards]], except where noted\n| headline = Side one\n| title1   = [[If You Can't Rock Me]]\n| length1  = 3:46\n| title2   = [[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\n| note2    = writers: [[Norman Whitfield]], [[Eddie Holland]]\n| length2  = 3:30\n| title3   = [[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)]]\n| writer3    = \n| length3  = 5:07\n| title4   = [[Till the Next Goodbye]]\n| length4  = 4:37\n| title5   = [[Time Waits for No One (song)|Time Waits for No One]]\n| length5  = 6:37\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline = Side two\n| title1   = Luxury\n| length1  = 5:00\n| title2   = [[Dance Little Sister (The Rolling Stones song)|Dance Little Sister]]\n| length2  = 4:11\n| title3   = If You Really Want to Be My Friend\n| length3  = 6:16\n| title4   = Short and Curlies\n| length4  = 2:43\n| title5  = [[Fingerprint File]]\n| length5 = 6:33\n}}\n\n===Other songs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Title\n!Length\n!Notes\n|-\n|\"Through the Lonely Nights\"\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4:07\n|rowspan=\"1\"| \"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\" B-side\n|}\n\n==Personnel==\n'''The Rolling Stones'''\n*[[Mick Jagger]] \u2013 lead vocals {{small|(all tracks)}}, backing vocals {{small|(1\u20136, 9)}}, acoustic guitar {{small|(4)}}, electric guitar {{small|(10)}}\n*[[Keith Richards]] \u2013 electric guitar {{small|(all but 4)}}, backing vocals {{small|(1\u20136, 8, 9)}}, acoustic guitar {{small|(4, 8)}}, bass guitar {{small|(1)}}\n*[[Mick Taylor]] \u2013 electric guitar {{small|(1, 4, 5, 7\u20139)}}, acoustic guitar {{small|(4, 5)}}, bass guitar {{small|(10)}}\n*[[Bill Wyman]] \u2013 bass guitar {{small|(2, 4\u20139)}}, [[synthesizer]] {{small|(5, 10)}}\n*[[Charlie Watts]] \u2013 drums {{small|(all but 3)}}\n\n\n'''Additional personnel'''\n*[[Nicky Hopkins]] \u2013 piano {{small|(4\u20136, 8, 10)}}\n*[[Billy Preston]] \u2013 piano {{small|(1, 2, 10)}}, [[clavinet]] {{small|(2, 10)}}, organ {{small|(8)}}\n*[[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] \u2013 piano {{small|(3, 7, 9)}}\n*[[Ray Cooper]] \u2013 percussion {{small|(1, 2, 5, 6)}}\n*[[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]] \u2013 backing vocals {{small|(8)}}\n*Charlie Jolly \u2013 [[tabla]] {{small|(10)}}\n*Ed Leach \u2013 [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] {{small|(2)}}\n\n'''Basic track on \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\"'''\n*[[Kenney Jones]] \u2013 drums\n*[[Willie Weeks]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 backing vocals\n*[[Ronnie Wood]] \u2013 twelve\u2013string acoustic guitar, backing vocals\n\n'''Production'''\n*[[Andy Johns]] \u2013 [[Audio engineering|recording engineer]]\n*[[Keith Harwood]] \u2013 recording engineer, mixing\n*George Chkiants \u2013 overdub engineer\n*[[Glyn Johns]] \u2013 mixing (on \"Fingerprint File\")\n*[[Guy Peellaert]] \u2013 cover art design and painting\n*[[Bob Clearmountain]] \u2013 1994 remastering\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It was the last Rolling Stones album for guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] and the songwriting and recording of the album's title track had a connection to Taylor's eventual replacement, [[Ronnie Wood]]. The album also marked the 10th anniversary since the release of the band's debut album, [[The Rolling Stones (album)|''The Rolling Stones'']]. ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' combines the core [[British blues|blues]] and [[rock 'n' roll]]-oriented sound with elements of [[funk]] and [[reggae]].<ref name=\"Rivadavia\">{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rolling-stones-its-only-rock-n-roll/|title=How the Rolling Stones Returned to the Fundamentals on 'It's Only Rock 'n' Roll'|first=Eduardo|last=Rivadavia|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref> ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' reached number one in the United States and number two in the UK.\n\nThough it wasn't as successful as their prior albums, ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' was an important transitional album for the Rolling Stones.  Long-time producer [[Jimmy Miller]] was out, and the album was self-produced by guitarist [[Keith Richards]] and singer [[Mick Jagger]] under the pseudonym \"[[The Glimmer Twins]]\".  Guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] missed the initial recording sessions with health problems, and ended up quitting the Rolling Stones a few months after the album's release.  The rest of the instrumentation included bassist [[Bill Wyman]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]], as well as frequent collaborators [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], [[Nicky Hopkins]], and [[Billy Preston]], and featured the first appearance of percussionist [[Ray Cooper]], who would continue to work with the Rolling Stones into the 1980s.\n\nThe [[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)|title track]] bears special note as it was recorded separately from the rest of the album.  The basic rhythm track had been laid down by members of the [[Faces (band)|Faces]], including rhythm guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]] and drummer [[Kenney Jones]] during a jam session with Mick Jagger, [[David Bowie]], and bassist [[Willie Weeks]].  Jagger liked the song so much, he brought the basic track to Richards, who added some guitar overdubs, and after some polishing, was put on the album as-is.  After Taylor left the Rolling Stones at the end of 1974, the band would approach Wood to become a full-time member.\n\n==History==\nWork began on ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' following the Rolling Stones' autumn [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European tour]]. Production began in November at [[Munich]], [[Germany]]'s [[Musicland Studios]]. According to guitarist [[Keith Richards]], \"We were really hot (off the road) and ready just to play some new material.\"<ref name=\"RS 175\">{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=Making The Stones' New Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/making-the-stones-new-album-19741205|work=Rolling Stone Magazine No. 175|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=5 December 1974}}</ref> The recording sessions were attended by Belgian painter [[Guy Peellaert]], who [[Mick Jagger]] invited to do the album cover after seeing his work in the book ''Rock Dreams'', which featured illustrations of various rock musicians such as the Stones. Peellaert eventually painted the band as \"rock deities,\" descending a temple staircase, surrounded by young girls and women worshiping them in [[Clothing in ancient Greece|Grecian clothing]]. The artist refused to sign a deal of exclusivity, and in 1974 provided the album art for [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''.<ref>[https://www.athenaart.com/its-only-rock-n-roll.html IT'S ONLY ROCK N ROLL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022141152/https://www.athenaart.com/its-only-rock-n-roll.html |date=22 October 2016 }}, Athena Art</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Mammoth Book of the Rolling Stones: An anthology of the best writing about the greatest rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band in the world\n|first=Sean|last=Egan|page=182|publisher=Hachette|year=2013|ISBN=1-78033-647-0}}</ref>\n\n===Recording===\nThe album was at first developed as a half-live, half-studio production with one side of the album featuring live performances from the Stones' European tour while the other side was to be composed of newly recorded cover versions of the band's favourite [[R&B]] songs. Covers recorded included a take of [[Dobie Gray]]'s \"[[Drift Away]]\", [[Jimmy Reed]]'s \"Shame Shame Shame,\u201d and [[The Temptations]]' \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]].\" Soon the band began working off riffs by Richards and new ideas by [[Mick Jagger]] and the original concept was scrapped in favour of an album with all-new material. The cover of \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\" was the only recording to make the cut, while the \"Drift Away\" cover is a popular [[bootleg recording|bootleg]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stadler |first1=Gustavus |title=Cover Art |url=http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2013/06/25/cover-art/ |website=Avidly |accessdate=23 April 2019 |date=25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' marked the Stones' first effort in the producer's chair since ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', and the first for Jagger and Richards under their pseudonym \"[[The Glimmer Twins]].\" On the choice to produce, Richards said at the time:\n\n<blockquote>\"I think we'd come to a point with [[Jimmy Miller|Jimmy (Miller)]] where the contribution level had dropped because it'd got to be a habit, a way of life, for Jimmy to do one Stones album a year. He'd got over the initial sort of excitement which you can feel on ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' and ''[[Let It Bleed]]''. Also, Mick and I felt that we wanted to try and do it ourselves because we really felt we knew much more about techniques and recording and had our own ideas of how we wanted things to go. ''Goats Head Soup'' hadn't turned out as we wanted to \u2013 not blaming Jimmy or anything like that... But it was obvious that it was time for a change in that particular part of the process of making records.\"<ref name=\"RS 175\" /></blockquote>\n\nStarting with this release, all future Rolling Stones albums would either be produced by themselves or in collaboration with an outside producer.\n\nMost of the album's backing tracks were recorded first at Musicland; solo vocals were recorded later by Jagger, about whom Richards would say, \"he often comes up with his best stuff alone in the studio with just an engineer.\"<ref name=\"RS 175\" />\n\nThe song \"Luxury\" showed the band's growing interest in [[reggae]] music, while \"[[Till the Next Goodbye]]\" and \"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\" continued their immersion in [[ballad]]s. Seven of the album's 10 songs crack the four-minute mark, a feature that would come to be disparaged during the rising [[punk rock]] scene of the late 1970s.\n\n[[Ronnie Wood]], a long-time acquaintance of the band, began to get closer to the Rolling Stones during these sessions after he invited Mick Taylor to play on his debut album, ''[[I've Got My Own Album to Do]]''. Taylor spent some time recording and hanging out at Wood's house [[The Wick]]. By chance, Richards was asked one night by Wood's wife at the time, Krissy, to join them at the guitarist's home.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} While there, Richards recorded some tracks with Wood and quickly developed a close friendship, with Richards going as far as moving into Wood's guest room.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Jagger soon entered the mix and it was here that the album's lead single and title track, \"[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)]]\", was first recorded. Wood worked closely on the track with Jagger, who subsequently took the song and title for their album. The released version of this song features Wood on 12-string acoustic guitar.\n\n''It's Only Rock 'n Roll'' was Mick Taylor's last album with the Rolling Stones, and he played on just seven of the 10 tracks (he did not play on tracks 2, 3 or 6).{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSimilar to receiving no writing credits on the Stones' previous album, ''Goats Head Soup'', Taylor reportedly had made songwriting contributions to \"Till the Next Goodbye\" and \"[[Time Waits for No One (song)|Time Waits for No One]],\" but on the album jacket, all original songs were credited to Jagger/Richards. Taylor said in 1997:\n\n<blockquote>\"I did have a falling out with Mick Jagger over some songs I felt I should have been credited with co-writing on ''It's Only Rock 'n Roll''. We were quite close friends and co-operated quite closely on getting that album made. By that time Mick and Keith weren't really working together as a team so I'd spend a lot of time in the studio.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bungey|first=John|title=Hello Goodbye|url=http://www.micktaylorwemissyou.com/mojo.html|work=Issue 48|publisher=Mojo Magazine|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=November 1997}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTaylor's statement contradicts Jagger's earlier comment concerning the album. Jagger stated in a 1995 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview about \"Time Waits for No One\" that Taylor \"maybe threw in a couple of chords.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAlongside the usual outside contributors, namely [[Billy Preston]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and unofficial member [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], [[Elton John]] sideman [[Ray Cooper]] acted as percussionist for the album. Several songs were finished songs and overdubs and mixing were performed at Jagger's home, [[Stargroves]], in the early summer of 1974.\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r16838|pure_url=yes}} link]</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev2score = B<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=rolling+stone|title=Robert Christgau: CG: rolling stone|website=www.robertchristgau.com}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[D\u017euboks]]''\n|rev3score = (unfavourable)<ref name=\"dzuboks\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|title=It's Only Rock 'n Roll|journal=D\u017euboks|publisher=De\u010dje novine|location=Gornji Milanovac|issue=5 (second series)|page=23|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[The Great Rock Discography]]''\n|rev4Score = 6/10<ref name=\"OnlyR'n'R/Acclaimed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A324.htm|title=The Rolling Stones ''It's Only Rock 'n' Roll''|publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]|accessdate=15 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127214917/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A324.htm|archive-date=27 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|rev5 = [[MusicHound]]\n|rev5score = 3/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/952 952]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/952}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[NME]]''\n|rev6Score = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7911448&style=music |title=The Rolling Stones \u2013 It's Only Rock 'n' Roll CD|publisher=[[CD Universe]]/[[Muze]]|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110412195111/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-rolling-stones/albumguide \"The Rolling Stones: Album Guide\"].

Despite the familiar sound, it surprised many by failing to reach the top 10 in the United States (although it did reach the top 10 in the UK). With its sing-along chorus, it has become a staple at Rolling Stones concerts. The B-side \"Through the Lonely Nights\" dates back to the previous year's ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' sessions. A cover of \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg,\" originally a 1966 hit by [[The Temptations]], was released as the second single in the United States only, where it also became a top 20 hit. Its parent album appeared in October with brisk initial sales, reaching number two in the UK (breaking a string of number-one albums that stretched back to 1969's ''[[Let It Bleed]]'') and number one in the United States, where it eventually went platinum.\n\nReviews were largely positive, with [[Jon Landau]] calling ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'' \"one of the most intriguing and mysterious, as well as the darkest, of all Rolling Stones records.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Landau|first=John|title=The Rolling Stones / It's Only Rock 'n Roll|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/its-only-rock-n-roll-19741219|work=Rolling Stone Magazine No. 172|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=16 October 1974}}</ref> However rock critic [[Lester Bangs]] disparaged the album in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', much like ''Goats Head Soup'', saying, \"The Stones have become oblique in their old age, which is just another word for perverse except that perverse is the corniest concept extant as they realized at inception... ''Soup'' was friendly and safe. I want the edge and this album doesn't reassure me that I'll get it, what a curious situation to be stuck in, but maybe that's the beauty of the Stones, hah, hah, kid? This album is false. Numb. But it cuts like a dull blade. Are they doing the cutting, or are we?\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Bangs|first=Lester|title=It's Only the Rolling Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEeovH2wN9kC&pg=PA156|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=31 October 1974}}</ref>\n\nAuthor James Hector added that ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'' was a definitive turning point for the band. \"The album marked the band\u2019s decisive entry into a comfortable living as rock's elder statesmen. From this point on, their youth culture importance vanished, and there would be few musical surprises in the future.\" Hector concluded with \"On ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'', the band had become what they imagined their mass audience desired them to be. They were wrong.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Hector | first = James | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = The Complete Guide to the Music of The Rolling Stones| publisher =Omnibus Press | year = 1995 | location = London, England | pages = 95 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7119-4303-6}}</ref>\n\nInstead of immediately touring to promote the album, the band decided to head back into the Munich studios to record the next album, to Mick Taylor's disappointment and subsequent resignation from the band.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} A tour didn't happen until the following summer in the United States, the \u2018[[Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75|Tour of the Americas '75]]\u2019, with future member Ronnie Wood taking Taylor's place on guitar.\n\nThe title track became a permanent staple of the band's live setlist, but apart from some performances of \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\" and \"If You Can\u2019t Rock Me\" on the [[Licks Tour]], none of the other tracks have been performed since 1977. As of 2006, \"Till The Next Goodbye,\" \"Time Waits For No-One,\" \"If You Really Want To Be My Friend\" and \"Short and Curlies\" had never been played live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksoff.org/debuts.htm|title=ROCKS OFF SETLISTS|website=www.rocksoff.org}}</ref>\n\nIn order to promote the album, music videos were filmed for several of the songs. The most commonly seen video from the album was the one for \"It\u2019s Only Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll (But I Like It),\" featuring the band (in sailor suits) playing in a tent, which gradually fills with soap bubbles (Taylor is featured in the video but did not actually play on the recorded cut). Videos were also filmed for \"Ain\u2019t Too Proud to Beg\" and \"Till The Next Goodbye.\"\n\nIn 1994, ''It's Only Rock \u2019n Roll'' was remastered and reissued by [[Virgin Records]], in 2009 by [[Universal Music]], and once more in 2011 by [[Universal Music Enterprises]] in a Japanese-only SHM-[[Super Audio CD|SACD]] version. The 1994 remaster was initially released in a Collector's Edition CD, which replicated in miniature elements of the original vinyl album packaging.\n\nTwo different versions of \"Luxury\" exist. A shorter version (4:30) is included on the early CD version from 1986, while the 5:01 version was originally released on vinyl in Europe, and on the 1994 and 2009 CD remasters. The difference is the shorter version starts the fadeout 30 seconds earlier, and thereby missing the short guitar solo at the end.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Tracklist\n| all_writing = [[Jagger/Richards|Mick Jagger and Keith Richards]], except where noted\n| headline = Side one\n| title1   = [[If You Can't Rock Me]]\n| length1  = 3:46\n| title2   = [[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\n| note2    = writers: [[Norman Whitfield]], [[Eddie Holland]]\n| length2  = 3:30\n| title3   = [[It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)]]\n| writer3    = \n| length3  = 5:07\n| title4   = [[Till the Next Goodbye]]\n| length4  = 4:37\n| title5   = [[Time Waits for No One (song)|Time Waits for No One]]\n| length5  = 6:37\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline = Side two\n| title1   = Luxury\n| length1  = 5:00\n| title2   = [[Dance Little Sister (The Rolling Stones song)|Dance Little Sister]]\n| length2  = 4:11\n| title3   = If You Really Want to Be My Friend\n| length3  = 6:16\n| title4   = Short and Curlies\n| length4  = 2:43\n| title5  = [[Fingerprint File]]\n| length5 = 6:33\n}}\n\n===Other songs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Title\n!Length\n!Notes\n|-\n|\"Through the Lonely Nights\"\n|rowspan=\"1\"| 4:07\n|rowspan=\"1\"| \"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\" B-side\n|}\n\n==Personnel==\n'''The Rolling Stones'''\n*[[Mick Jagger]] \u2013 lead vocals {{small|(all tracks)}}, backing vocals {{small|(1\u20136, 9)}}, acoustic guitar {{small|(4)}}, electric guitar {{small|(10)}}\n*[[Keith Richards]] \u2013 electric guitar {{small|(all but 4)}}, backing vocals {{small|(1\u20136, 8, 9)}}, acoustic guitar {{small|(4, 8)}}, bass guitar {{small|(1)}}\n*[[Mick Taylor]] \u2013 electric guitar {{small|(1, 4, 5, 7\u20139)}}, acoustic guitar {{small|(4, 5)}}, bass guitar {{small|(10)}}\n*[[Bill Wyman]] \u2013 bass guitar {{small|(2, 4\u20139)}}, [[synthesizer]] {{small|(5, 10)}}\n*[[Charlie Watts]] \u2013 drums {{small|(all but 3)}}\n\n\n'''Additional personnel'''\n*[[Nicky Hopkins]] \u2013 piano {{small|(4\u20136, 8, 10)}}\n*[[Billy Preston]] \u2013 piano {{small|(1, 2, 10)}}, [[clavinet]] {{small|(2, 10)}}, organ {{small|(8)}}\n*[[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] \u2013 piano {{small|(3, 7, 9)}}\n*[[Ray Cooper]] \u2013 percussion {{small|(1, 2, 5, 6)}}\n*[[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]] \u2013 backing vocals {{small|(8)}}\n*Charlie Jolly \u2013 [[tabla]] {{small|(10)}}\n*Ed Leach \u2013 [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] {{small|(2)}}\n\n'''Basic track on \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\"'''\n*[[Kenney Jones]] \u2013 drums\n*[[Willie Weeks]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 backing vocals\n*[[Ronnie Wood]] \u2013 twelve\u2013string acoustic guitar, backing vocals\n\n'''Production'''\n*[[Andy Johns]] \u2013 [[Audio engineering|recording engineer]]\n*[[Keith Harwood]] \u2013 recording engineer, mixing\n*George Chkiants \u2013 overdub engineer\n*[[Glyn Johns]] \u2013 mixing (on \"Fingerprint File\")\n*[[Guy Peellaert]] \u2013 cover art design and painting\n*[[Bob Clearmountain]] \u2013 1994 remastering\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
