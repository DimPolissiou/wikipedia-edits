Artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to [[heart transplantation]], or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including [[Willem Johan Kolff]] and [[Robert Jarvik]].\n\nAn artificial heart is distinct from a [[ventricular assist device]] (VAD) designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs, used only for a few hours at a time, most commonly during [[cardiac surgery]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart with pink heart background.jpg|thumb|The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart]]\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--Origins, half of \"First clinical applications of a permanent pneumatic total artificial heart\", \"First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump\", and \"First clinical application of an paracorporeal pump\" sections have no citations-->\n\n===Origins===\nA synthetic replacement for the heart remains a long-sought \"holy grail\" of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]]s, because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.\n\nAlthough the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Consequences of these issues include severe [[transplant rejection|foreign-body rejection]] and external batteries that limit mobility. These complications limited the lifespan of early human recipients to hours or days.\n\n===Early development===\nThe first artificial heart was made by the Soviet scientist [[Vladimir Demikhov]] in 1937. It was implanted in a dog.\n\nOn 2 July 1952, 41-year-old [[Henry Opitek]], suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820123708/http://www.harperhospital.org/harper/ Harper University Hospital] at [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan.

The University of Utah developed a similar apparatus around the same time, but when they tried to patent it, Winchell's heart was cited as prior art. The university requested that Winchell donate the heart to the University of Utah, which he did.\nThere is some debate as to how much of Winchell's design Robert Jarvik used in creating Jarvik's artificial heart. Heimlich states, \"I saw the heart, I saw the patent and I saw the letters. The basic principle used in Winchell's heart and Jarvik's heart is exactly the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/phil116bioethics/files/2015/02/jarvik7.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160818074549/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/phil116bioethics/files/2015/02/jarvik7.jpg|url-status=dead|title=jarvik7.jpg (625x800 pixels)|date=18 August 2016|archivedate=18 August 2016|website=emory.edu}}</ref>\" Jarvik denies that any of Winchell's design elements were incorporated into the device he fabricated for humans which was successfully implanted into Barney Clark in 1982.\n\nOn 12 December 1957, [[Willem Johan Kolff]], the world's most prolific inventor of artificial organs, implanted an artificial heart into a dog at Cleveland Clinic. The dog lived for 90 minutes.\n\nIn 1958, [[Domingo Liotta]] initiated the studies of TAH replacement at Lyon, France, and in 1959\u201360 at the [[National University of C\u00f3rdoba]], Argentina. He presented his work at the meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs held in Atlantic City in March 1961. At that meeting, Liotta described the implantation of three types of orthotopic (inside the pericardial sac) TAHs in dogs, each of which used a different source of external energy: an implantable electric motor, an implantable rotating pump with an external electric motor, and a pneumatic pump.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1961 | title = Artificial Heart in the chest: Preliminary report | url = | journal = Trans.

To help manage his many endeavors, Kolff assigned project managers. Each project was named after its manager. Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the Jarvik 7.\n\nIn 1981, [[William DeVries]] submitted a request to the FDA for permission to implant the Jarvik 7 into a human being. On 2 December 1982, Kolff implanted the Jarvik 7 artificial heart into Barney Clark, a dentist from Seattle who was suffering from severe [[congestive heart failure]]. Clark lived for 112 days tethered to an external pneumatic compressor, a device weighing some {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, but during that time he suffered prolonged periods of confusion and a number of instances of bleeding, and asked several times to be allowed to die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebrities.healthdiaries.com/the-25th-anniversary-of-barney-clarks-artificial-heart.html|title=The 25th Anniversary of Barney Clark's Artificial Heart|author=Barron H.

After 64 hours, the pneumatic-powered artificial heart was removed and replaced by a donor heart. However thirty-two hours after transplantation, the man died of what was later proved to be an acute pulmonary infection, extended to both lungs, caused by fungi, most likely caused by an [[immunosuppressive drug]] complication.<ref>Orthotopic cardiac prosthesis for two-staged cardiac replacement.

Moreover, two sizable catheters had to cross the body wall to carry the pneumatic pulses to the implanted heart, greatly increasing the risk of infection. To speed development of a new generation of technologies, the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] opened a competition for implantable electrically powered artificial hearts. Three groups received funding: [[Cleveland Clinic]] in Cleveland, Ohio; the College of Medicine of [[Pennsylvania State University]] ([[Penn State Hershey Medical Center]]) in Hershey, Pennsylvania; and AbioMed, Inc. of Danvers, Massachusetts.

A motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers, and that fluid causes the membrane to move; blood flows through the other side of each membrane. The blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cow's heart, to make the device more biocompatible. The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device.

Artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to [[heart transplantation]], or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including [[Willem Johan Kolff]] and [[Robert Jarvik]].\n\nAn artificial heart is distinct from a [[ventricular assist device]] (VAD) designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs, used only for a few hours at a time, most commonly during [[cardiac surgery]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart with pink heart background.jpg|thumb|The SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart]]\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--Origins, half of \"First clinical applications of a permanent pneumatic total artificial heart\", \"First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump\", and \"First clinical application of an paracorporeal pump\" sections have no citations-->\n\n===Origins===\nA synthetic replacement for the heart remains a long-sought \"holy grail\" of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]]s, because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.\n\nAlthough the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Consequences of these issues include severe [[transplant rejection|foreign-body rejection]] and external batteries that limit mobility. These complications limited the lifespan of early human recipients to hours or days.\n\n===Early development===\nThe first artificial heart was made by the Soviet scientist [[Vladimir Demikhov]] in 1937. It was implanted in a dog.\n\nOn 2 July 1952, 41-year-old [[Henry Opitek]], suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820123708/http://www.harperhospital.org/harper/ Harper University Hospital] at [[Wayne State University]] in Michigan.

The university requested that Winchell donate the heart to the University of Utah, which he did.\nThere is some debate as to how much of Winchell's design Robert Jarvik used in creating Jarvik's artificial heart.

To help manage his many endeavors, Kolff assigned project managers. Each project was named after its manager. Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart, which was subsequently renamed the Jarvik 7.\n\nIn 1981, [[William DeVries]] submitted a request to the FDA for permission to implant the Jarvik 7 into a human being. On 2 December 1982, Kolff implanted the Jarvik 7 artificial heart into Barney Clark, a dentist from Seattle who was suffering from severe [[congestive heart failure]]. Clark lived for 112 days tethered to an external pneumatic compressor, a device weighing some {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, but during that time he suffered prolonged periods of confusion and a number of instances of bleeding, and asked several times to be allowed to die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebrities.healthdiaries.com/the-25th-anniversary-of-barney-clarks-artificial-heart.html|title=The 25th Anniversary of Barney Clark's Artificial Heart|author=Barron H.

[[William J. Schroeder|Bill Schroeder]] became the second recipient and lived for a record 620 days.\n\nContrary to popular belief and erroneous articles in several periodicals, the Jarvik heart was not banned for permanent use. Today, the modern version of the Jarvik 7 is known as the [[SynCardia Systems|SynCardia]] temporary Total Artificial Heart. It has been implanted in more than 1,350 people as a bridge to transplantation.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, artificial hearts were powered by dishwasher-sized pneumatic power sources whose lineage went back to [[Alfa Laval]] [[Dairy#Milking machines|milking machines]]. Moreover, two sizable catheters had to cross the body wall to carry the pneumatic pulses to the implanted heart, greatly increasing the risk of infection. To speed development of a new generation of technologies, the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] opened a competition for implantable electrically powered artificial hearts. Three groups received funding: [[Cleveland Clinic]] in Cleveland, Ohio; the College of Medicine of [[Pennsylvania State University]] ([[Penn State Hershey Medical Center]]) in Hershey, Pennsylvania; and AbioMed, Inc. of Danvers, Massachusetts. Despite considerable progress, the Cleveland program was discontinued after the first five years.\n\n===First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump===\nOn 19 July 1963, E.
