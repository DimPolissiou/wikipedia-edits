The infant's head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, crying, and moving the [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s may all seem normal, depending on the severity of the condition. However, after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased [[muscle]] tone ([[hypertonia]]). After several months of life, [[seizure]]s and [[hydrocephalus]] may develop, if they did not exist at birth. Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic quadriparesis ([[paralysis]]), and intellectual deficits.\n\nSome infants may have additional abnormalities at birth including seizures, [[myoclonus]] (involuntary sudden, rapid jerks), limited thermoregulation abilities, and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] problems.\n\nStill other infants display no obvious symptoms at birth, going many months without a confirmed diagnosis of hydranencephaly. In some cases severe hydrocephalus, or other cephalic condition, is misdiagnosed.\n\n==Causes==\nHydranencephaly is an extreme form of [[porencephaly]], which is characterized by a cyst or cavity in the cerebral hemispheres.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of hydranencephaly remains undetermined in most cases, the most likely general cause is by vascular insult such as stroke or injury, intrauterine infections, or traumatic disorders after the first trimester of pregnancy. In a number of cases where intrauterine infection was determined the causing factor, most involved toxoplasmosis and viral infections such as enterovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, cytomegalic, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, and syncytial viruses. Another cause factor is determined to be [[monochorionic twin]] pregnancies, involving the death of one twin in the second trimester, which in turn causes vascular exchange to the living twin through placental circulation through twin-to-twin transfusion, causing hydranencephaly in the surviving fetus.<ref name=\"Kurtz & Johnson\">{{cite web|last=Kurtz & Johnson|first=Alfred & Pamela|title=Case Number 7: Hydranencephaly|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/210/2/419.full#ref-3|work=Radiology, 210, 419-422}}</ref> One medical journal reports hydranencephaly as an autosomal inherited disorder with an unknown mode of transmission, where an unknown blockage of the carotid artery where it enters the cranium causes obstruction and damage to the cerebral cortex.<ref name=\"National Organization for Rare Disorders\"/>\n\n===Genetic===\nAs a recessive genetic condition, both parents must carry the asymptomatic gene and pass it along to their child, a chance of 25 percent.

[[Transillumination]], an examination in which [[light]] is passed through body tissues, can be used to diagnose hydranencephaly. An accurate, confirmed diagnosis is generally impossible until after birth, though prenatal diagnosis using fetal ultrasonography (ultrasound) can identify characteristic physical abnormalities that exist. Through thorough clinical evaluation, via physical findings, detailed patient history, and advanced imaging techniques, such as angiogram, computerized tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or more rarely transillumination after birth are the most accurate diagnostic techniques.<ref name=\"National Organization for Rare Disorders\"/> However, diagnostic literature fails to provide a clear distinction between severe obstructive hydrocephalus and hydranencephaly, leaving some children with an unsettled diagnosis.<ref name=\"Dubey\"/>\n\nPreliminary diagnosis may be made in utero via standard ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a standard anatomy ultrasound. This sometimes proves to provide a misdiagnosis of differential diagnoses including bilaterally symmetric schizencephaly (a less destructive developmental process on the brain), severe hydrocephalus (cerebrospinal fluid excess within the skull), and alobar holoprosencephaly (a neurological developmental anomaly). Once destruction of the brain is complete, the cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus, and portions of the occipital lobes typically remain preserved to varying degrees. Though the cerebral cortex is absent, in most cases the fetal head remains enlarged due to the continued production by the choroid plexus of cerebrospinal fluid that is inadequately reabsorbed causing increased intracranial pressure.<ref name=\"Kurtz & Johnson\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThere is no standard treatment for hydranencephaly. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. An accompanying diagnosis of hydrocephalus may be treated with surgical treatment of a [[cerebral shunt|shunt]], which often grants a much better prognosis and greater quality of life.<ref>\"[[Everything Guide to Children with Hydranencephaly]]\" by Brayden Alexander Global Foundation for Hydranencephaly, Incorporated.</ref>\n\nThe prognosis for children with hydranencephaly is generally quite poor.

The town lies 537 m above sea level, some eight Kilometers south of the city [[Mari\u00e1nsk\u00e9 L\u00e1zn\u011b]] and belongs to the [[Okres Tachov]] (Tachov District).\n\n== History ==\nAlready a locality in 1316 - raised to a city in 1514 - mentioned in historical sources in the property of the knights Ctibor and Oldrich. The small stronghold from this time was inhabited until 1733.\n\nFrom the 16th century the counts of [[Haimhausen]] had authority in Plan\u00e1. A catastrophic fire in the 18th century burnt down the ancient church of the city in the year 1733 and was replaced in the years 1748-1754 by the new baroque church along with vicarage. The vicarage was dedicated to John the Baptist. In 1930 the statistic for religious affinity was counted with 1698 catholic and 37 non-Catholics.\n\nIn 1734 a small baroque castle was begun, a dipterous storied building with [[Mansard roof]] and 1906 another small castle.\n\nThe city is well known for the oldest brewery in the west-Bohemian region, which is named Chodovar. The first written reference to the brewery originates from [1573], ownership was initially with the Adels family [[Schlick (Adelsfamilie)|von Schlick]]. The brewery in 1634 already produced \"1920 pailful\", some 1173 litres.\n\nThe brewery is best known today for its \"Original Beer Spa\".

The beer soak spa treatment is said to have medicinal benefits.\n\nAfter a fire in 1861, the owners of the time left the Count of Berchem-Haimhausen the old stone basement which still today preserves the brewery, which belonged to the Count of Berchem-Haimhausen to the time of the Second World War .

It was written by Andrew Taggart and Elizabeth Mencel and produced by the Chainsmokers.\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with Mike Wass of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]], the Chainsmokers said, \"We always felt the song was special. When you want to listen to it again and again after you\u2019ve made the song, you know you\u2019ve got something. You\u2019ve really got to put it out and let the public try to decide what it is and what it isn\u2019t. When we put the song out, it was an overwhelmingly positive response. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a hit but we knew that it was a special song. I think that it definitely has a Chainsmokers feel to it, but there\u2019s a lot of influences ([[Taylor Swift]], [[Max Martin]]) in the production. But I think that\u2019s what\u2019s cool about it and why people are enjoying it because it doesn\u2019t feel and sound like everything that\u2019s on the radio right now. But it\u2019s catchy and accessible. I think it\u2019s refreshing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.idolator.com/7615803/chainsmokers-interview-roses-bouquet-ep|title = The Chainsmokers On Rising Hit \"Roses\"|access-date = December 11, 2015|date = November 23, 2015|work = Idolator}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Roses\" is written in the key of [[E major]] with a [[tempo]] of 100 beats per minute in [[Time signature|common time]].

They meet and spend the night watching an old film and smoking on her couch, however in the morning he leaves while she is still asleep. She is upset to see the man has gone and that night searches for him, while he is seen driving his car around the city. She is crying on a street when he sees her and stops his car, and they are reunited and embrace. They return to her couch and the video ends with them kissing. Throughout the video the woman can also be seen dancing in a dark, misty room with two spotlights, and after the couple are reunited, rose petals fall through the air as she dances through them.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline  = Digital download<ref name=\"Google Play\" />\n| title1  = Roses\n| note1  = featuring Rozes\n| length1  = 3:46\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline  = Digital download \u2013 Remixes EP<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/roses-feat.-rozes-remixes-ep/id1055434022 |title=iTunes (U.S.) - Music - The Chainsmokers - Roses (feat.

It was written by Andrew Taggart and Elizabeth Mencel and produced by the Chainsmokers.\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with Mike Wass of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]], the Chainsmokers said, \"We always felt the song was special. When you want to listen to it again and again after you\u2019ve made the song, you know you\u2019ve got something. You\u2019ve really got to put it out and let the public try to decide what it is and what it isn\u2019t. When we put the song out, it was an overwhelmingly positive response. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a hit but we knew that it was a special song. I think that it definitely has a Chainsmokers feel to it, but there\u2019s a lot of influences ([[Taylor Swift]], [[Max Martin]]) in the production. But I think that\u2019s what\u2019s cool about it and why people are enjoying it because it doesn\u2019t feel and sound like everything that\u2019s on the radio right now. But it\u2019s catchy and accessible. I think it\u2019s refreshing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.idolator.com/7615803/chainsmokers-interview-roses-bouquet-ep|title = The Chainsmokers On Rising Hit \"Roses\"|access-date = December 11, 2015|date = November 23, 2015|work = Idolator}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Roses\" is written in the key of [[E major]] with a [[tempo]] of 100 beats per minute in [[Time signature|common time]].

They meet and spend the night watching an old film and smoking on her couch, however in the morning he leaves while she is still asleep. She is upset to see the man has gone and that night searches for him, while he is seen driving his car around the city. She is crying on a street when he sees her and stops his car, and they are reunited and embrace. They return to her couch and the video ends with them kissing. Throughout the video the woman can also be seen dancing in a dark, misty room with two spotlights, and after the couple are reunited, rose petals fall through the air as she dances through them.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline  = Digital download<ref name=\"Google Play\" />\n| title1  = Roses\n| note1  = featuring Rozes\n| length1  = 3:46\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline  = Digital download \u2013 Remixes EP<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/roses-feat.-rozes-remixes-ep/id1055434022 |title=iTunes (U.S.) - Music - The Chainsmokers - Roses (feat.
