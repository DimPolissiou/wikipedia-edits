After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]  won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

His father, Mehraban Mehr was from the province of [[Kerman]], and at the age of 14 migrated to Tehran for greater economic and social opportunities. He went on to become Chief Accountant in the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Majlis Showraye Melli]] parliament, the predecessor of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly (Iran)]]. His mother, Paridokht (n\u00e9e Barkhordar), was a granddaughter of Khajeh Barkhordar, a Zoroastrian [[Yazd]]i immigrant to Tehran, who served as one of the farm-managers of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]]. Farhang was raised as a devout Zoroastrian and a patriotic Iranian.<!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end-->\n\n==Education==\nUpon graduating from the Polytechnic with a degree in mechanical engineering, he joined [[Tehran University]] and obtained a bachelor's degree from the School of Law, Economics and Political Science. Then he went to England, where he received an L.L.M. from [[London School of Economics]], [[University of London]], and a Doctor of Philosophy from [[University of Southampton]]. In 1975 he was awarded LL.D. (honoris causa) by the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end-->\n\n==Early career==\nReturning to Tehran in 1957, Mehr joined the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] as head of the Department of International Contracts and Industrial Relations. During this period, he also served as an advisor to the Minister of Commerce.  Subsequently, at the invitation of the Minister of Finance, Mehr moved to that ministry where he consecutively held the following positions: Director General of Oil and International Relations, Governor for Iran in OPEC, Director General of Economic Affairs and Monopolies, Deputy Minister in charge of finance (revenue and treasury) and economic affairs.<!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end-->\n\n==Higher civil service==\nMehr was then nominated by the Prime Minister to serve as the Minister of Finance.  However, he could not become a minister under Iran\u2019s constitutional law which preserved the ministerial posts for Muslims only. Thus, he became General Deputy Minister. During the premiership of [[Amir Abbas Hoveyda]], Mehr served as Acting Minister for several months.  Mehr then resigned to register his opposition to the relevant discriminatory provision in the constitutional law. Prime Minister Hoveyda responded by offering Mehr the position of Deputy Prime Minister with all the privileges of a minister except the title. To continue to demonstrate his opposition to the laws affecting non-Muslims, and after a few months of serving in that position resigned with publicity.<!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end-->\n\n==Private enterprise==\nHe then assumed the position of Chairman of the Board and Executive Director of the largest insurance company in Iran, \u201c[http://bimeh-iran.co.uk/ Bimeh-ye Iran].\u201d In this position, he created a new regulatory agency for insurance, called the Central Insurance Company.  He also initiated the insurance pools within the framework of the Regional Corporation for Development (RCD), as well as the College of Insurance for the training of insurance staff among Iran, [[Turkey]], and [[Pakistan]].  The building of the famous [[Abbasi Hotel|Shah Abbas Hotel]] in [[Isfahan]] was during Mehr\u2019s presidency in Bimeh-yeh Iran. During this time, he continued to serve as Iranian Governor for OPEC.  In addition to his governmental positions, Mehr was also teaching at [[Iran\u2019s Military Academy]], [[Tehran University]], [[National University of Iran]], College of Accounting and College of Insurance.

In 1973, the International Health Organization (WHO) chose Pahlavi University as the center for giving on the job training courses to the faculties of the medical schools the South Mediterranean countries.  In recognition of his valuable services Mehr was the first and only non-Muslim Iranian decorated with First rank [http://www.icollector.com/Medal-PERSIA-Iran-ORDER-OF-THE-LION-SUN-NISHAN-I-HOMAYOUN_i6404403 Homayoun Medallion] and Second rank [http://www.medal-medaille.com/index.php?cPath=69 Taj Medalion].<!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end-->\n\n==Exile==\nIn 1981, two years after the establishment of the [[Iranian Revolution|Revolutionary Islamic Republic of Iran]], Mehr immigrated to the [[United States]]. There he joined [[Boston University]] as Professor of International Relations, known now as the [[Pardee School]] of Global Studies. In 1982, Mehr served as the recipient of a certificate in appreciation for the contribution of Iranians to life in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from Governor [[Michael Dukakis]].

Adults measure {{convert|7-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total and are usually dark grey to blue on the back and sides, with an orange belly and throat. Males are more conspicuously coloured than the drab females, especially during breeding season.\n\nThe alpine newt occurs at high altitude as well as in the lowlands. Living mainly in forested land habitats for most of the year, the adults migrate to puddles, ponds, lakes or similar water bodies for breeding. Males court females with a ritualised [[courtship display|display]] and deposit a [[spermatophore]]. After fertilisation, females usually fold their eggs into leaves of water plants. The [[larva]]e grow up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s. [[Paedomorphic]] adults, which keep their [[gills]] and stay aquatic, occur in the south of the range. Larvae and adults feed mainly on diverse [[invertebrates]] and fall themselves prey to [[dragonfly]] larvae, large [[beetles]], fish, snakes, birds or mammals.\n\n[[Populations]] of the alpine newt started to diverge around 20 [[million years ago]]. At least four [[subspecies]] are distinguished, and some argue there are several distinct, [[cryptic species|cryptic]] species. Although still relatively common and classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], alpine newt populations are decreasing and have locally gone extinct. The main threats are [[habitat destruction]], [[water pollution|pollution]] and the introduction of fish such as [[trout]] into breeding sites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768 by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], as ''Triton alpestris'' from the [[\u00d6tscher]] mountain in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin).{{r|Laurenti1768}} He used that name for a female and described the male (''Triton salamandroides'') and the larva (''Proteus tritonius'') as different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in the genus ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. After this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages based on genetic evidence,{{r|TitusLarson1995|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} the alpine newt was split off by [[Mario Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds]] and colleagues as the [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, the name ''Ichthyosaura'' was already introduced in 1801 by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] for \"''Proteus tritonius''\", the larva of the alpine newt.{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} It therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}} \"Ichthyosaura\", Greek for \"fish lizard\", refers to a [[nymph]]-like creature in [[classical mythology]].{{r|Schmidtler2009}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nFour [[subspecies]] (see table below) were recognised for the alpine newt by [[Zbyn\u011bk Ro\u010dek]] and colleagues (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} while a number of previously described subspecies were not retained. The four subspecies correspond only in part to the five major lineages identified within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below): The western [[population]]s of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris'' are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Differences in body shape and colour between the subspecies are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}}\n\nSeveral authors argued that the ancient lineages of the alpine newt might represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} [[Jean Raffa\u00eblli]] therefore distinguished four species in 2018,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this was considered premature by [[Darrel Frost]] in 2020.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Raffa\u00eblli (2018) classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" |  Distribution \n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || retained as ''I. alpestris alpestris'' || Northwestern France to northern Carpathians in Romania, southern Denmark in to Alps and France just north of the Mediterranean\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || ''I. reiseri'' (species), with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina'' || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || ''I. apuana'' (species), with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria) || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]]\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || retained || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || ''I. veluchiensis'' (species) || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]]\n\n|}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt populations have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular clock]] estimate by [[Ernesto Recuero]] and colleagues.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Known fossil remains are much more recent: they were found in the [[Pliocene]] of Slovakia{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=38}} and the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be the [[sister species]] of the alpine newt.{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses showed that alpine newts split into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which in part correspond to described subspecies (see section ''Distribution and subspecies'' above).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These ancient genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the Miocene or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages probably took place. Populations from [[Vlasina Lake]] in Serbia have [[mitochondrial DNA]] that is distinct from all other populations and may represent a [[ghost lineage]] inherited from a now extinct ancestor population.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of retreat into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|ChiocchioBisconti2017}}\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Bergmolchwerbung_2.jpg|thumb|right|Dorsal view of a male (bright blue, left) courting a female (mottled grey, right) in a shallow pond]]\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_aplestris_ventral_view_chrischan.jpeg|thumb|right|Throat and belly are orange and usually unspotted.]]\n\nThe alpine newt is a medium-sized, stocky newt species. It reaches {{convert|7\u201312|cm|in|abbr=on}} length in total, with females roughly {{convert|1\u20132|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than males. The tail is compressed sideways and half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low (up to 2.5 mm), smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=10-13}}\n\nThe characteristic dark grey to bright blue colour of the back and sides, mainly in males, is strongest during breeding season. This base colour may vary to greenish and is more drab and mottled in females. The belly and throat are orange and only occasionally (especially in the subspecies ''I. a. apuana'') have dark spots. Males have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Juvenile [[eft]]s, just after [[metamorphosis]], resemble adult terrestrial females, but sometimes have a red or yellow line on the back. Very rarely, [[leucistic]] individuals have been observed.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=12-36}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u201311 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|3\u20135|cm|in|abbr=on}} just before metamorphosis. They initially have only two small filaments (balancers), between the eyes and [[gills]] on each side of the head, which later disappear when the fore- and then the hindlegs develop.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=97-104}} The larvae are light brown to yellow and initially have dark longitudinal stripes, which later dissove into a dark pigmentation that is stronger towards the tail. The tail is pointed and sometimes ends in a short filament. Alpine newt larvae are more robust and have wider heads than those of the [[smooth newt]] and [[palmate newt]].{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=13-14}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution in Spain, Italy and Greece correspond to distinct subspecies (see section ''Taxonomy: Subspecies'' above).{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Alpine newts have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations are avoided), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to adequate land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates suitable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], smooth, palmate or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Lifecycle and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9\u201310 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The efts are probably terrestrial until they reach [[sexual maturity]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} This happens after around three years in males, and four to five years in females. Alpine newts can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile [[eft]] hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in terrestrial hiding places. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls of basement ducts, where they hibernated, on wet nights. {{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juvenile efts, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but such large distances are uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts at snow melt, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} In the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana'', two rounds of breeding and egg-laying in autumn and spring have been observed .{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]]. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while, then fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggest that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females, while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female usually have several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\n[[File:Triturus_alpestris_ovum.jpg|thumb|right|Egg with larvae just before hatching, note the longitudinal stripes]]\n\n[[File:MesotritonAlpestrisLarva1.JPG|thumb|right|Larva with fore- and hindlegs developed]]\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They can lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} Metamorphosis occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_alpestris_apuanus05.jpg|thumb|right|Paedomorphic adult of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of a population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat for example various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including of the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders and [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can prey on newts, while small efts on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defensive position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail and secrete a milky substance.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}} Only trace amounts of the poison [[tetrodotoxin]], abundant in the North American Pacific newts (''[[Taricha]]''), have been found in the alpine newt.{{r|WakelyFuhrman1966}} They also sometimes produce sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Captivity==\n\nSeveral subspecies of the alpine newt have been bred in captivity, including a population from [[Proko\u0161ko Lake]] in Bosnia that is now probably extinct in the wild. Efts often return to the water after only one year. Captive individuals have reached an age of 15-20 years.{{r|1=Raffaelli2014|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=217}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt was classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] in 2009. The population trend however is \"Decreasing\", and the different geographic lineages, which may represent [[evolutionary significant units]], have not been evaluated separately.{{r|iucn}} Several populations in the Balkans, some of which have been described as subspecies of their own, are highly threatened or have even gone extinct.{{r|1=Raffaelli2018|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=133-134}}\n\nThreats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats. [[European beaver|Beavers]], previously widespread in Europe, were probably important in maintaining breeding sites. Introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]] such as trout, and potentially [[crayfish]] is a significant threat that can eradicate populations from a breeding site. In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades. Lack of adequate, undisturbed land habitat (see section ''Habitats'' above) and [[wildlife corridor|dispersal corridors]] around and between breeding sites, is another problem.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=130-144}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by chytridiomycosis,{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, eradication was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3\u20134 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite web | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ChiocchioBisconti2017\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chiocchio | first1 = A. | last2 = Bisconti | first2 = R. | last3 = Zampiglia | first3 = M. |last4 = Nascetti | first4 = G. | last5 = Canestrelli | first5 = D. | title = Quaternary history, population genetic structure and diversity of the cold-adapted Alpine newt ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' in peninsular Italy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 2017 | pages = 2955 | issn = 2045-2322 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03116-x| pmid = 28592856 | pmc = 5462806 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.2955C }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ Cite document |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

[[continental Europe]] and introduced to [[Great Britain]] and [[New Zealand]]. Adults measure {{convert|7-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total and are usually dark grey to blue on the back and sides, with an orange belly and throat. Males are more conspicuously coloured than the drab females, especially during breeding season.\n\nThe alpine newt occurs at high altitude as well as in the lowlands. Living mainly in forested land habitats for most of the year, the adults migrate to puddles, ponds, lakes or similar water bodies for breeding. Males court females with a ritualised [[courtship display|display]] and deposit a [[spermatophore]]. After fertilisation, females usually fold their eggs into leaves of water plants. The [[larva]]e grow up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s. [[Paedomorphic]] adults, which keep their [[gills]] and stay aquatic, occur in the south of the range. Larvae and adults feed mainly on diverse [[invertebrates]] and fall themselves prey to [[dragonfly]] larvae, large [[beetles]], fish, snakes, birds or mammals.\n\n[[Populations]] of the alpine newt started to diverge around 20 [[million years ago]]. At least four [[subspecies]] are distinguished, and some argue there are several distinct, [[cryptic species|cryptic]] species. Although still relatively common and classified at [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], alpine newt populations are decreasing and have locally gone extinct. The main threats are [[habitat destruction]], [[water pollution|pollution]] and the introduction of fish such as [[trout]] into breeding sites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768 by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], as ''Triton alpestris'' from the [[\u00d6tscher]] mountain in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin).{{r|Laurenti1768}} He used that name for a female and described the male (''Triton salamandroides'') and the larva (''Proteus tritonius'') as different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in the genus ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. After this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages based on genetic evidence,{{r|TitusLarson1995|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} the alpine newt was split off by [[Mario Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds]] and colleagues as the [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, the name ''Ichthyosaura'' was already introduced in 1801 by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] for \"''Proteus tritonius''\", the larva of the alpine newt.{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} It therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}} \"Ichthyosaura\", Greek for \"fish lizard\", refers to a [[nymph]]-like creature in [[classical mythology]].{{r|Schmidtler2009}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nFour [[subspecies]] (see table below) were recognised for the alpine newt by [[Zbyn\u011bk Ro\u010dek]] and colleagues (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} while a number of previously described subspecies were not retained. The four subspecies correspond only in part to the five major lineages identified within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below): The western [[population]]s of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris'' are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Differences in body shape and colour between the subspecies are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}}\n\nSeveral authors argued that the ancient lineages of the alpine newt might represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} [[Jean Raffa\u00eblli]] therefore distinguished four species in 2018,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this was considered premature by [[Darrel Frost]] in 2020.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Raffa\u00eblli (2018) classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" |  Distribution \n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || retained as ''I. alpestris alpestris'' || Northwestern France to northern Carpathians in Romania, southern Denmark in to Alps and France just north of the Mediterranean\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || ''I. reiseri'' (species), with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina'' || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || ''I. apuana'' (species), with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria) || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]]\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || retained || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || ''I. veluchiensis'' (species) || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]]\n\n|}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt populations have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular clock]] estimate by [[Ernesto Recuero]] and colleagues.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Known fossil remains are much more recent: they were found in the [[Pliocene]] of Slovakia{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=38}} and the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be the [[sister species]] of the alpine newt.{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses showed that alpine newts split into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which in part correspond to described subspecies (see section ''Distribution and subspecies'' above).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These ancient genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the Miocene or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages probably took place. Populations from [[Vlasina Lake]] in Serbia have [[mitochondrial DNA]] that is distinct from all other populations and may represent a [[ghost lineage]] inherited from a now extinct ancestor population.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of retreat into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|ChiocchioBisconti2017}}\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Bergmolchwerbung_2.jpg|thumb|right|Dorsal view of a male (bright blue, left) courting a female (mottled grey, right) in a shallow pond]]\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_aplestris_ventral_view_chrischan.jpeg|thumb|right|Throat and belly are orange and usually unspotted.]]\n\nThe alpine newt is a medium-sized, stocky newt species. It reaches {{convert|7\u201312|cm|in|abbr=on}} length in total, with females roughly {{convert|1\u20132|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than males. The tail is compressed sideways and half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low (up to 2.5 mm), smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=10-13}}\n\nThe characteristic dark grey to bright blue colour of the back and sides, mainly in males, is strongest during breeding season. This base colour may vary to greenish and is more drab and mottled in females. The belly and throat are orange and only occasionally (especially in the subspecies ''I. a. apuana'') have dark spots. Males have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Juvenile [[eft]]s, just after [[metamorphosis]], resemble adult terrestrial females, but sometimes have a red or yellow line on the back. Very rarely, [[leucistic]] individuals have been observed.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=12-36}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u201311 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|3\u20135|cm|in|abbr=on}} just before metamorphosis. They initially have only two small filaments (balancers), between the eyes and [[gills]] on each side of the head, which later disappear when the fore- and then the hindlegs develop.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=97-104}} The larvae are light brown to yellow and initially have dark longitudinal stripes, which later dissove into a dark pigmentation that is stronger towards the tail. The tail is pointed and sometimes ends in a short filament. Alpine newt larvae are more robust and have wider heads than those of the [[smooth newt]] and [[palmate newt]].{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=13-14}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution in Spain, Italy and Greece correspond to distinct subspecies (see section ''Taxonomy: Subspecies'' above).{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Alpine newts have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations are avoided), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to adequate land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates suitable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], smooth, palmate or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Lifecycle and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9\u201310 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The efts are probably terrestrial until they reach [[sexual maturity]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} This happens after around three years in males, and four to five years in females. Alpine newts can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile [[eft]] hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in terrestrial hiding places. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls of basement ducts, where they hibernated, on wet nights. {{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juvenile efts, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but such large distances are uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts at snow melt, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} In the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana'', two rounds of breeding and egg-laying in autumn and spring have been observed .{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]]. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while, then fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggest that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females, while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female usually have several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\n[[File:Triturus_alpestris_ovum.jpg|thumb|right|Egg with larvae just before hatching, note the longitudinal stripes]]\n\n[[File:MesotritonAlpestrisLarva1.JPG|thumb|right|Larva with fore- and hindlegs developed]]\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They can lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} Metamorphosis occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_alpestris_apuanus05.jpg|thumb|right|Paedomorphic adult of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of a population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat for example various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including of the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders and [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can prey on newts, while small efts on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defensive position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail and secrete a milky substance.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}} Only trace amounts of the poison [[tetrodotoxin]], abundant in the North American Pacific newts (''[[Taricha]]''), have been found in the alpine newt.{{r|WakelyFuhrman1966}} They also sometimes produce sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Captivity==\n\nSeveral subspecies of the alpine newt have been bred in captivity, including a population from [[Proko\u0161ko Lake]] in Bosnia that is now probably extinct in the wild. Efts often return to the water after only one year. Captive individuals have reached an age of 15-20 years.{{r|1=Raffaelli2014|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=217}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt was classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] in 2009. The population trend however is \"Decreasing\", and the different geographic lineages, which may represent [[evolutionary significant units]], have not been evaluated separately.{{r|iucn}} Several populations in the Balkans, some of which have been described as subspecies of their own, are highly threatened or have even gone extinct.{{r|1=Raffaelli2018|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=133-134}}\n\nThreats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats. [[European beaver|Beavers]], previously widespread in Europe, were probably important in maintaining breeding sites. Introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]] such as trout, and potentially [[crayfish]] is a significant threat that can eradicate populations from a breeding site. In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades. Lack of adequate, undisturbed land habitat (see section ''Habitats'' above) and [[wildlife corridor|dispersal corridors]] around and between breeding sites, is another problem.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=130-144}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by chytridiomycosis,{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, eradication was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3\u20134 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite web | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ChiocchioBisconti2017\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chiocchio | first1 = A. | last2 = Bisconti | first2 = R. | last3 = Zampiglia | first3 = M. |last4 = Nascetti | first4 = G. | last5 = Canestrelli | first5 = D. | title = Quaternary history, population genetic structure and diversity of the cold-adapted Alpine newt ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' in peninsular Italy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 2017 | pages = 2955 | issn = 2045-2322 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03116-x| pmid = 28592856 | pmc = 5462806 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.2955C }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ Cite document |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

The coast line curves left round the headland.]]\n{{Lowca Light Railway and Gilgarran Branch|collapse=yes}}\n\n'''Parton Halt railway station''' was opened by the LNWR and FR Joint Railway (\"The Joint Line\") in January 1915 and closed by the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMSR]] fourteen years later in 1929.\n\nThe halt never appeared on any public timetable, as it was provided to enable workmen to get from {{rws|Whitehaven}} to the isolated colliery, coke ovens and bi-products plant on the hilltop at [[Lowca]]. The halt was at the foot of steep tracks up to these workplaces.\n\n==Location==\nThe line past the halt is clearly shown on standard railway maps,{{sfn|Jowett|1989|loc=Map 36}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 26}} but the halt eludes them all; however, it is shown on contemporary OS maps.<ref>[http://maps.nls.uk/view/101092444 The halt on a 1927 OS map via ''National Library of Scotland'']</ref><ref>[http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16&lat=54.5749&lon=-3.5771&layers=10 The halt on a 1937 OS map via ''National Library of Scotland'']</ref> It is not to be confused with {{rws|Parton}} which in 2015 remained on the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] {{convert|25|ch|km}} to the south of the site of the halt.\n\nFurther research is needed to establish the physical nature of the halt, such structures in many parts of the country were very rudimentary.\n\n==History==\nThe halt was on the WCER's [[Gilgarran Branch]], occasionally referred to as the Gilgarron Branch. The company and the branch were fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nAll lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, few more so than the Gilgarran Branch. Many iron mines, quarries, collieries and attendant works were situated in inaccessible areas with low populations, making workmen's trains a natural add-on service. Lowca had a workmen's service - and for a shorter period an advertised passenger service -  from the north along the clifftops provided by the [[Lowca Light Railway]] in conjunction with the [[Cleator and Workington Junction Railway]] (CWJR). The service to Parton Halt met the same need from the south.\n\n==Services==\n\nNo Sunday passenger service was provided.\n\nA passenger service from {{rws|Distington}} to Whitehaven  along the Gilgarran Branch had run from 1881 to 1883, but it was not a success and was withdrawn. A Thursdays and Saturdays only (Market Days) service was run from Distington to Whitehaven, calling or changing at {{rws|Parton}} from autumn 1913 (sources disagree whether from October or November) to September 1914,{{sfn|Quayle|2007|p=46}} these trains passed the site of the future Parton Halt, but served a different purpose. \n\nThe initial service, which started on 11 January 1915, can be seen on the attached Working Time table (WTT) extract. Service times were set to match shift changes at the colliery and associated works. This was a common pattern with such halts across the country.\n\nGoods traffic passed the halt, but did not call.{{sfn|Quayle|2007|pp=79-80}} The April 1917 Working Time Table shows three Up mineral trains travelling a mile beyond the halt to No 4 Pit and two travelling beyond to Distington Ironworks, with an extra on Saturdays, all matched by Down trains. \n\nThe line past the site of the halt went on to become a late survivor on the West Cumberland scene. The colliery at Lowca wound coal until 1968, feeding the associated works. After it closed coal continued to come from Solway Colliery, Workington until it closed in 1973, at which point the surviving business for the bi-product works and coal washery at Lowca was handled by road.

The halt was at the foot of steep tracks up to these workplaces.\n\n==Location==\nThe line past the halt is clearly shown on standard railway maps,{{sfn|Jowett|2000|loc=Map 36}}{{sfn|Smith|Turner|2012|loc=Map 26}} but the halt eludes them all; however, it is shown on contemporary OS maps.<ref>[http://maps.nls.uk/view/101092444 The halt on a 1927 OS map via ''National Library of Scotland'']</ref><ref>[http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16&lat=54.5749&lon=-3.5771&layers=10 The halt on a 1937 OS map via ''National Library of Scotland'']</ref> It is not to be confused with {{rws|Parton}} which in 2015 remained on the [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] {{convert|25|ch|km}} to the south of the site of the halt.\n\nFurther research is needed to establish the physical nature of the halt, such structures in many parts of the country were very rudimentary.\n\n==History==\nThe halt was on the WCER's [[Gilgarran Branch]], occasionally referred to as the Gilgarron Branch. The company and the branch were fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nAll lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, few more so than the Gilgarran Branch. Many iron mines, quarries, collieries and attendant works were situated in inaccessible areas with low populations, making workmen's trains a natural add-on service. Lowca had a workmen's service - and for a shorter period an advertised passenger service -  from the north along the clifftops provided by the [[Lowca Light Railway]] in conjunction with the [[Cleator and Workington Junction Railway]] (CWJR). The service to Parton Halt met the same need from the south.\n\n==Services==\n\nNo Sunday passenger service was provided.\n\nA passenger service from {{rws|Distington}} to Whitehaven  along the Gilgarran Branch had run from 1881 to 1883, but it was not a success and was withdrawn. A Thursdays and Saturdays only (Market Days) service was run from Distington to Whitehaven, calling or changing at {{rws|Parton}} from autumn 1913 (sources disagree whether from October or November) to September 1914,{{sfn|Quayle|2007|p=46}} these trains passed the site of the future Parton Halt, but served a different purpose. \n\nThe initial service, which started on 11 January 1915, can be seen on the attached Working Time table (WTT) extract. Service times were set to match shift changes at the colliery and associated works. This was a common pattern with such halts across the country.\n\nGoods traffic passed the halt, but did not call.{{sfn|Quayle|2007|pp=79-80}} The April 1917 Working Time Table shows three Up mineral trains travelling a mile beyond the halt to No 4 Pit and two travelling beyond to Distington Ironworks, with an extra on Saturdays, all matched by Down trains. \n\nThe line past the site of the halt went on to become a late survivor on the West Cumberland scene. The colliery at Lowca wound coal until 1968, feeding the associated works. After it closed coal continued to come from Solway Colliery, Workington until it closed in 1973, at which point the surviving business for the bi-product works and coal washery at Lowca was handled by road. The end products from Lowca were taken away northwards along the clifftops using the surviving parts of the Lowca Light Railway.{{sfn|McGowan Gradon|2004|p=53}} Incoming coal from Solway Colliery was worked south along the coast line to Parton, where the train reversed {{convert|1|mi|11|ch|km}} up the Gilgarron Branch, past the site of the halt to a junction known as \"Bain's Siding\" where it ran forward up the side of the valley to Lowca, effecting a zig-zag to gain the necessary height.{{sfn|Anderson|2002|p=309}}{{sfn|Quayle|2007|p=45}} Until 1968 at least, coal was also wound at No.4 Pit near Bain's Siding and taken down the branch past the site of the halt.{{sfn|Quayle|2007|p=80}}\n\n==Rundown and closure==\nThe halt closed in 1929, with buses able to provide a more attractive door-to-workplace gate service.
