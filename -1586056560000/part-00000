{"title_page": "Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe '''Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope''' ('''EIT''') is an [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] on the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] [[spacecraft]] used to obtain high-resolution [[image]]s of the [[solar corona]] in the [[ultraviolet]] range.  The EIT instrument is sensitive to [[light]] of four different [[wavelength]]s: 17.1, 19.5, 28.4, and 30.4 [[nanometer|nm]], corresponding to light produced by highly [[ion]]ized [[iron]] (XI)/(X), (XII), (XV), and [[helium]] (II), respectively.  EIT is built as a single telescope with a quadrant structure to the entrance mirrors: each quadrant reflects a different colour of EUV light, and the wavelength to be observed is selected by a shutter that blocks light from all but the desired quadrant of the main telescope.\n\nThe EIT wavelengths are of great interest to solar physicists because they are emitted by the very hot [[solar corona]] but not by the relatively cooler [[photosphere]] of the Sun; this reveals structures in the corona that would otherwise be obscured by the brightness of the Sun itself.  EIT was originally conceived as a [[viewfinder]] instrument to help select observing targets for the other instruments on board SOHO, but EIT is credited with a good fraction of the original science to come from SOHO, including the first observations of traveling wave phenomena in the corona, characterization of [[coronal mass ejection]] onset, and determination of the structure of [[coronal hole]]s. Before mid-2010, EIT obtained an Fe XII (19.5&nbsp;nm wavelength) image of the Sun about four times an hour, around the clock; these were immediately uplinked as time-lapse movies to the [http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov SOHO web site] for immediate viewing by anyone who is interested.  (Since the summer of 2010, when Thorpe commissioning of the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] was completed, its [[Atmospheric Imaging Assembly]] has been able to take much higher resolution solar images much more frequently. The white-light coronagraphs on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] are thus able to take images more frequently: they share a CPU and telemetry bandwidth with EIT. The images are used for long-duration studies of the Sun, for detailed structural analyses of solar features, and for real-time [[space weather]] prediction by the [[NOAA]] [[Space Weather Prediction Center]].\n\n==Technology==\n\nEIT is the first long-duration instrument to use [[normal incidence]] multilayer [[Optical coating|coated optics]] to image the [[Sun]] in  [[ultraviolet|extreme ultraviolet]]. This portion of the spectrum is extremely difficult to reflect, as most [[matter]] absorbs the light very strongly. Conventionally these wavelengths have been reflected either using [[angle of incidence (optics)|grazing incidence]] (as in a [[Wolter telescope]] for imaging [[X-rays]]) or a [[diffraction grating]] (as in the jocularly-termed [[overlappograph]] flown on [[Skylab]] in the mid 1970s). Modern [[vacuum deposition]] technology allows mirrors to be coated with extremely thin layers of nearly any material. The multilayer mirrors in an EUV telescope are coated with alternate layers of a light \"spacer\" element (such as [[silicon]]) that absorbs EUV light only weakly, and a heavy \"scatterer\" element (such as [[molybdenum]]) that absorbs EUV light very strongly.  Perhaps 100 layers of each type might be placed on the mirror, with a thickness of around 10 [[nanometer|nm]] each. The layer thickness is tightly controlled, so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer interfere constructively.  In this way, reflectivities of up to ~50% can be attained.\n\nThe multilayer technology allows conventional telescope forms (such as the [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] or [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope|Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien]] designs) to be used in a novel part of the spectrum.  Solar imaging with multilayer EUV optics was pioneered in the 1990s by the [[MSSTA]] and [[NIXT]] [[sounding rocket]]s, each of which flew on several five-minute missions into space. Multilayer EUV optics are also used in terrestrial [[nanolithography]] rigs for fabrication of [[integrated circuit|microchip]]s.\n\nThe EIT detector is a conventional [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s that are back-illuminated and specially thinned to admit the EUV photons. Because the detector is about equally sensitive to EUV and visible photons, and the Sun is about one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (10<sup>9</sup>) times brighter in visible light than in EUV, special thin foil filters are used to block the visible light while admitting the EUV. The filters are made of extremely thin [[aluminum foil]], about 200&nbsp;nm (0.2 micrometre) thick, and transmit about half of the incident EUV light while absorbing essentially all of the incident visible light.\n\n==History==\n\nEIT was a difficult sell to the scientific funding agencies, as it was not clear in the early 1990s that simple imaging of the corona would be scientifically useful (most of the other instruments on board SOHO are [[Spectrometer|spectrographs]] of various kinds).  The EIT [[principal investigator|PI]], [[Jean-Pierre Delaboudiniere]], was forced to scrounge funding and resources from several locations to construct and launch the instrument.  For example, EIT alone of the SOHO instruments does not have its own [[flight computer]]; it is connected to the [[Large Angle Solar Coronagraph|LASCO]] instrument flight computer, and is treated operationally as an additional LASCO camera.  No funding was available for a pointing adjustment mechanisms, so EIT is bolted directly to the spacecraft and hence forms the SOHO pointing reference:  the other instruments all align themselves to the EIT images.  Focus adjustment is achieved by [[thermal expansion]]: the internal survival heaters (found in most spaceborne instruments) are used to achieve microscopic changes in the size of the telescope structure and hence the mirror spacing. EIT was originally allocated only about 1  kbit/s of data\u2014about the same speed as a 110 [[baud]] [[Teleprinter|teletype]]\u2014but after its utility became clear much more [[telemetry]]  [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] was allocated to it.\n\n==Related instruments==\n\nThe technology in EIT is based on prototype instruments that were flown on the [[sounding rocket]] payloads [[MSSTA]] and [[NIXT]].  The first multilayer telescope to image the full disk of the Sun in EUV was flown by [[A.B.C. Walker]] and team in 1987.

In 1744, an Irish Presbyterian preacher Samuel Finley was called to take charge of the newly formed congregation on the lower branch of the [[Octoraro Creek]], a short distance south of what was soon to become the [[Mason-Dixon line]]. The congregation lived on the broad, rolling land known as the Nottingham Lots.\n\nFinley, in later years became president of the College of New Jersey ([[Princeton University]]), was a teacher as well as a preacher. Finley held that to be an intelligent Christian one needed to use the mind God provided, and that one's mind could reach full effectiveness only through training. The task of the church, for Finley, was to administer the sacraments and comfort the sick, to baptize the infants and consecrate marriage, to bury the dead and preach the Word of God. But the task of the church also was to teach men and women to think by exposing them to the great thoughts of the ages in order to produce rational beings capable of creative action in a new and swiftly changing world.\n\nFinley opened the school in 1744. It was a crude log structure at the rear of his own home, located near the present site of the Rising Sun Middle School. The log building on the present campus was built as a replica of the original school building from descriptions in old records and students\u2019 memoirs.\n\nWithin a few years, church and Academy were moved to their present location. A two-story building was erected to house the school activities at the site of what is now the sunken garden at Gayley. When it burned, a single-story building replaced it, only to be destroyed some years later by storm. In 1865 the red brick J. Paul Slaybaugh Old Academy was erected and stands to this day.\n\nThe Academy was the first of the Presbyterian preparatory boarding schools and the forerunner of some 1,600 similar academies in the country. As public education became the norm, the Presbyterian Church allowed most of its secondary schools to close or converted them to colleges. Nottingham dropped its formal ties to the church in 1972, but continues \n \nIn the last twenty years, the Chesapeake Learning Center was founded, and the school's decades-long commitment to the education of international students was formalized with the creation of the English as a Second Language curriculum. In addition, enrollment doubled and a middle school was started. The middle school failed and was closed in 2006, completing its last year in 2009.\n\nMany new facilities were constructed, including the C. Herbert Foutz Student Center (1989), the East and West Dormitories (1998), and the Patricia A. Bathon Science Center (2003), or renovated including Magraw Hall (2000), and Finley Hall (2002). Summer 2007 saw the complete renovation of Rush Dormitory, renamed Rush House, and the construction of Durigg Plaza, an outdoor ampphitheater/meeting space for the campus community.  Renovation of Rowland dormitory was completed in the summer of 2008.\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. D. John Watson, Ph.D., West Nottingham focuses on the growth and definition of its programs through a process called CASCLE, an acronym for Constructing a Student Centered Learning Environment. Through CASCLE, work groups in the areas of academic curriculum, athletic and activities curriculum, and campus curriculum set goals for program improvement and develop the best pathway for their achievement.\n\n==Historic district==\n\n'''West Nottingham Academy Historic District''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] at [[Colora, Maryland|Colora]], [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]].

{"title_page": "Coronagraph", "text_new": "A '''coronagraph''' is a [[Telescope|telescopic]] attachment designed to block out the direct light from a [[star]] so that nearby objects &ndash; which otherwise would be hidden in the star's bright [[Glare (vision)|glare]] &ndash; can be resolved. Most coronagraphs are intended to view the [[solar corona|corona]] of the [[Sun]], but a new class of conceptually similar instruments (called ''stellar coronagraphs'' to distinguish them from ''solar coronagraphs'') are being used to find [[extrasolar planet]]s and [[circumstellar disk]]s around nearby stars as well as host galaxies in [[quasar]]s and other similar objects with active galactic nuclei ([[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]]).\n\n[[File:Cp22liberationdaytransient.png|thumb|right|200px|Coronagraph image of the Sun]]\n\n==Invention==\nThe coronagraph was introduced in 1931 by the French astronomer [[Bernard Lyot]]; since then, coronagraphs have been used at many [[Solar observatory|solar observatories]]. Coronagraphs operating within [[Earth's atmosphere]] suffer from scattered light in the [[sky]] itself, due primarily to [[Rayleigh scattering]] of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. At view angles close to the Sun, the sky is much brighter than the background corona even at high altitude sites on clear, dry days. Ground-based coronagraphs, such as the [[High Altitude Observatory]]'s [[Mark IV Coronagraph]] on top of [[Mauna Loa]], use [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] to distinguish sky brightness from the image of the corona: both coronal light and [[sky brightness]] are scattered [[sunlight]] and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is [[Thomson-scattered]] at nearly a [[right angle]] and therefore undergoes [[Polarization (waves)#Propagation, reflection and scattering|scattering polarization]], while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Wendelstein Solar Telescope.jpg|thumb|Coronagraph at the [[Wendelstein (mountain)#Mountain weather station and observatory|Wendelstein Observatory]]]]\nCoronagraph instruments are extreme examples of [[stray light]] rejection and precise [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] because the total brightness from the solar corona is less than one millionth the brightness of the Sun. The apparent surface brightness is even fainter because, in addition to delivering less total light, the corona has a much greater apparent size than the Sun itself.\n\nDuring a [[Solar eclipse|total solar eclipse]], the [[Moon]] acts as an occluding disk and any camera in the eclipse path may be operated as a coronagraph until the eclipse is over. More common is an arrangement where the sky is imaged onto an intermediate [[focal plane]] containing an opaque spot; this focal plane is reimaged onto a detector. Another arrangement is to image the sky onto a mirror with a small hole: the desired light is reflected and eventually reimaged, but the unwanted light from the star goes through the hole and does not reach the detector. Either way, the instrument design must take into account scattering and [[diffraction]] to make sure that as little unwanted light as possible reaches the final detector.  Lyot's key invention was an arrangement of lenses with stops, known as [[Lyot stop]]s, and baffles such that light scattered by diffraction was focused on the stops and baffles, where it could be absorbed, while light needed for a useful image missed them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/spartan/coronagraphs.html|title=SPARTAN 201-3: Coronagraphs|website=umbra.nascom.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, imaging instruments on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] offer coronagraphic capability.\n\n===Band-limited coronagraph===\nA ''band-limited coronagraph'' uses a special kind of mask called a ''band-limited mask''.<ref name=\"band-limited\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/570/2/900/54598.html | author=Kuchner and Traub | title=A Coronagraph with a Band-limited Mask for Finding Terrestrial Planets | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=570 | issue=2 | year=2002 | pages=900\u2013908 | doi=10.1086/339625 | bibcode=2002ApJ...570..900K|arxiv = astro-ph/0203455 }}</ref> This mask is designed to block light and also manage diffraction effects caused by removal of the light.

Several varieties of optical vortex coronagraphs exist:\n\n* the ''scalar'' optical vortex coronagraph based on a phase ramp directly etched in a dielectric material, like fused silica.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foo|first=Gregory|last2=Palacios|first2=David M.|last3=Swartzlander|first3=Grover A.

A mask of this kind can be synthesized by various technologies, ranging from [[liquid crystal polymer]] (same technology as in [[3D television]]), and micro-structured surfaces (using [[microfabrication]] technologies from the [[microelectronics]] industry). Such a vector vortex coronagraph made out of liquid crystal polymers is currently in use at the 200-inch [[Hale telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]]. It has recently been operated with [[adaptive optics]] to image [[extrasolar planets]].\n\nThis works with stars other than the sun because they are so far away their light is, for this purpose, a spatially coherent plane wave.  The coronagraph using interference masks out the light along the center axis of the telescope, but allows the light from off axis objects through.\n\n==Satellite-based coronagraphs==\nCoronagraphs in [[outer space]] are much more effective than the same instruments would be if located on the ground. This is because the complete absence of atmospheric scattering eliminates the largest source of glare present in a terrestrial coronagraph. Several space missions such as [[NASA]]-[[ESA]]'s [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], and NASA's SPARTAN, [[Solar Maximum Mission]], and [[Skylab]] have used coronagraphs to study the outer reaches of the solar corona.

The LASCO C-3 coronagraph uses both an external occulter (which casts shadow on the instrument) and an internal occulter (which blocks stray light that is Fresnel-diffracted around the external occulter) to reduce this leakage, and a complicated system of baffles to eliminate stray light scattering off the internal surfaces of the instrument itself.\n\n==Extrasolar planets==\nThe coronagraph has recently been adapted to the challenging task of finding planets around nearby stars.

Most coronagraphs are intended to view the [[corona]] of the [[Sun]], but a new class of conceptually similar instruments (called ''stellar coronagraphs'' to distinguish them from ''solar coronagraphs'') are being used to find [[extrasolar planet]]s and [[circumstellar disk]]s around nearby stars as well as host galaxies in [[Quasar|quasars]] and other similar objects with active galactic nuclei ([[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]]).\n\n[[File:Cp22liberationdaytransient.png|thumb|right|200px|Coronagraph image of the Sun]]\n\n==Invention==\nThe coronagraph was introduced in 1931 by the French astronomer [[Bernard Lyot]]; since then, coronagraphs have been used at many [[Solar observatory|solar observatories]]. Coronagraphs operating within [[Earth's atmosphere]] suffer from scattered light in the [[sky]] itself, due primarily to [[Rayleigh scattering]] of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. At view angles close to the Sun, the sky is much brighter than the background corona even at high altitude sites on clear, dry days. Ground-based coronagraphs, such as the [[High Altitude Observatory]]'s [[Mark IV Coronagraph]] on top of [[Mauna Loa]], use [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] to distinguish sky brightness from the image of the corona: both coronal light and [[sky brightness]] are scattered [[sunlight]] and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is [[Thomson-scattered]] at nearly a [[right angle]] and therefore undergoes [[Polarization (waves)#Propagation, reflection and scattering|scattering polarization]], while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Wendelstein Solar Telescope.jpg|thumb|Coronagraph at the [[Wendelstein (mountain)#Mountain weather station and observatory|Wendelstein Observatory]]]]\nCoronagraph instruments are extreme examples of [[stray light]] rejection and precise [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] because the total brightness from the solar corona is less than one millionth the brightness of the Sun. The apparent surface brightness is even fainter because, in addition to delivering less total light, the corona has a much greater apparent size than the Sun itself.\n\nDuring a [[Solar eclipse|total solar eclipse]], the [[Moon]] acts as an occluding disk and any camera in the eclipse path may be operated as a coronagraph until the eclipse is over. More common is an arrangement where the sky is imaged onto an intermediate [[focal plane]] containing an opaque spot; this focal plane is reimaged onto a detector. Another arrangement is to image the sky onto a mirror with a small hole: the desired light is reflected and eventually reimaged, but the unwanted light from the star goes through the hole and does not reach the detector. Either way, the instrument design must take into account scattering and [[diffraction]] to make sure that as little unwanted light as possible reaches the final detector.  Lyot's key invention was an arrangement of lenses with stops, known as [[Lyot stop]]s, and baffles such that light scattered by diffraction was focused on the stops and baffles, where it could be absorbed, while light needed for a useful image missed them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/spartan/coronagraphs.html|title=SPARTAN 201-3: Coronagraphs|website=umbra.nascom.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, imaging instruments on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] offer coronagraphic capability.\n\n===Band-limited coronagraph===\nA ''band-limited coronagraph'' uses a special kind of mask called a ''band-limited mask''.<ref name=\"band-limited\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/570/2/900/54598.html | author=Kuchner and Traub | title=A Coronagraph with a Band-limited Mask for Finding Terrestrial Planets | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=570 | issue=2 | year=2002 | pages=900\u2013908 | doi=10.1086/339625 | bibcode=2002ApJ...570..900K|arxiv = astro-ph/0203455 }}</ref> This mask is designed to block light and also manage diffraction effects caused by removal of the light.

A mask of this kind can be synthesized by various technologies, ranging from [[liquid crystal polymer]] (same technology as in [[3D television]]), and micro-structured surfaces (using [[microfabrication]] technologies from the [[microelectronics]] industry). Such a vector vortex coronagraph made out of liquid crystal polymers is currently in use at the 200-inch [[Hale telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]]. It has recently been operated with [[adaptive optics]] to image [[extrasolar planets]].\n\nThis works with stars other than the sun because they are so far away their light is, for this purpose, a spatially coherent plane wave.  The coronagraph using interference masks out the light along the center axis of the telescope, but allows the light from off axis objects through.\n\n==Satellite-based coronagraphs==\nCoronagraphs in [[outer space]] are much more effective than the same instruments would be if located on the ground. This is because the complete absence of atmospheric scattering eliminates the largest source of glare present in a terrestrial coronagraph. Several space missions such as [[NASA]]-[[ESA]]'s [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], and NASA's SPARTAN, [[Solar Maximum Mission]], and [[Skylab]] have used coronagraphs to study the outer reaches of the solar corona. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) is able to perform coronagraphy using the [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer]] (NICMOS),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stsci.edu/home/hst/instrumentation/legacy/nicmos|title=NICMOS|website=STScI.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> and there are plans to have this capability on the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) using its Near Infrared Camera ([[NIRCam]]) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI).\n\nWhile space-based coronagraphs such as [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory#Instruments|LASCO]] avoid the sky brightness problem, they face design challenges in stray light management under the stringent size and weight requirements of space flight.

Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on [[Italian neorealism]], and commented on how ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' and especially ''[[Pais\u00e0]]'' inspired him and influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, ''[[Il Mio Viaggio in Italia]]'' (''My Voyage to Italy''), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''Pais\u00e0'', which he first saw on television

This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics.

By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years until their divorce in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini \u2013 Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.

From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. ''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |title=Raging Bull |publisher=Eufs.org.uk |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430185450/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref> Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\n\nAlthough the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and [[Mardik Martin]] (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including [[Jay Cocks]] (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films ''The Age of Innocence'' and ''[[Gangs of New York]]''). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ageing bulls return |newspaper=Observer |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,98151,00.html |date=October 31, 1999 |first=Mark |last=Morris |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111064454/http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0%2C%2C98151%2C00.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008}}</ref> The [[American Film Institute]] chose ''Raging Bull'' as the number one American sports film on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Sports|their list of the top 10 sports films]].

In 2007, they ranked ''Raging Bull'' as the fourth greatest film of all time on their [[AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] list.\n\nScorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983). It is a [[satire]] on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act ([[kidnapping]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |title=The King of Comedy Film Review |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110220949/http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with.

It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The ''King of Comedy'' failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director [[Wim Wenders]] numbered it among his 15 favorite films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm |title=The Official Site |publisher=[[Wim Wenders]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020618113722/http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm|archive-date=June 18, 2002}}</ref> Also, in 1983, Scorsese made a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Anna Pavlova (film)|Anna Pavlova]]'' (also known as ''A Woman for All Time''), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, [[Michael Powell]]. This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nWith ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]\", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ|1951 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archivedate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.\n\nLooking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). Scorsese then married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called \"Life Lessons\".\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nAfter a decade of mostly mixed results, Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) was considered his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archivedate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won a number of other awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more. The American Film Institute placed ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').\n\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: ''[[Made in Milan]]'' about fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]]. The following year brought ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese actively dated actress [[Illeana Douglas]] following his third divorce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |title=Note Worthy|first= Dan|last= Jewel|date= March 1, 1999|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225552/https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film ''Quiz Show'' is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa |title=Films produced by De Fina-Cappa |work=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011625/http://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa/ |archivedate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).\n\n[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\n\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (The Leopard) as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&nbsp;XIV]]'' (The Taking of Power by Louis&nbsp;XIV). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''.\n\n''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"variety-gross\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archivedate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> but the film received mixed-to-positive notices from critics. In large part this was due to its significant stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence, which garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, with Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\n\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\n\nIf ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.\n\n''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalls the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with [[Miramax]] boss [[Harvey Weinstein]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,860378,00.html |title=Gangs of Los Angeles |work=The Guardian |date=December 15, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111091503/http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0%2C%2C860378%2C00.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008}}</ref> Despite denials of artistic compromise, some felt that ''Gangs of New York'' was the director's most conventional film, featuring standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] purposes and explanatory [[flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]].<ref name=\"guardian_film_of_the_week\">{{Cite news |author=Peter Bradshaw |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,871400,00.html |title=Gangs of New York |work=The Guardian |date=January 10, 2003 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111091432/http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0%2C%2C871400%2C00.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epinions.com/content_136317079172 |title=Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Gangs of New York at |publisher=Epinions.com |date=July 1, 2003 |accessdate=March 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012014134/http://epinions.com/content_136317079172|archive-date=October 12, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |author=Xan Brooks |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,871715,00.html |title=Past master |work=The Guardian |date=January 9, 2003 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111091447/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0%2C%2C871715%2C00.html |archivedate=January 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes long.<ref name=\"guardian_film_of_the_week\" /> Even so, the film received generally positive reviews with the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reporting that 75 percent of the reviews for the film they tallied were positive and summarizing the critics writing, \"Though flawed, the sprawling, messy ''Gangs of New York'' is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/ |title=Gangs of New York |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013039/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/ |archivedate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> The film's central themes are consistent with the director's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines.

The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-[[Electric Dylan controversy|controversial transformation]] from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his \"retirement\" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident.

Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on [[Italian neorealism]], and commented on how ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' and especially ''[[Pais\u00e0]]'' inspired him and influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, ''[[Il Mio Viaggio in Italia]]'' (''My Voyage to Italy''), Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''Pais\u00e0'', which he first saw on television

Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, [[Samuel Fuller]] and early [[Jean-Luc Godard]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html |title=Scorsese, Master Of The Rage |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 24, 1991 |first=Hal |last=Hinson|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203140433/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html|archive-date=December 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1974, actress [[Ellen Burstyn]] chose Scorsese to direct her in ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with ''[[Italianamerican]]'', a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.\n\n''[[Taxi Driver]]'' followed in 1976\u2014Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's gradual descent into insanity. The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the troubled and psychotic [[Travis Bickle]]. The film co-starred [[Jodie Foster]] in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, Matthew, called \"Sport\". ''Taxi Driver'' also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer [[Paul Schrader]], whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin [[Arthur Bremer]] and ''[[Pickpocket (film)|Pickpocket]]'', a film by the French director [[Robert Bresson]].

This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: {{quote|For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies.

By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years until their divorce in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini \u2013 Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.

From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. ''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |title=Raging Bull |publisher=Eufs.org.uk |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430185450/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref> Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\n\nAlthough the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and [[Mardik Martin]] (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft.

This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nWith ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]\", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ|1951 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archivedate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.\n\nLooking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). Scorsese then married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called \"Life Lessons\".\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nAfter a decade of mostly mixed results, Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) was considered his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archivedate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]'').

Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.

Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film ''Quiz Show'' is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa |title=Films produced by De Fina-Cappa |work=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011625/http://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa/ |archivedate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).\n\n[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\n\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (The Leopard) as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&nbsp;XIV]]'' (The Taking of Power by Louis&nbsp;XIV). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''.\n\n''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"variety-gross\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archivedate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> but the film received mixed-to-positive notices from critics. In large part this was due to its significant stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence, which garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, with Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\n\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\n\nIf ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.\n\n''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalls the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

In 1998, at the [[70th Academy Awards]], Scorsese presented the award to film legend [[Stanley Donen]]. When accepting the award Donen quipped, \"Marty this is backwards, I should be giving this to you, believe me\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/stanley-donen-oscar-speech-lifetime-achievement-1202046260/|title=Stanley Donen's Oscar Speech was an all time classic|website= [[IndieWire]]| accessdate= March 20, 2020}}</ref>  In 1999, at the [[71st Academy Awards]], Scorsese, and De Niro presented the award to film director [[Elia Kazan]].

The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films.
