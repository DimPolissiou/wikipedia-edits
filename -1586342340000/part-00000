He resigned from the ministry in April 2010 following allegations of improper use of ministerial allowances during an extramarital affair with [[Greens Western Australia|Greens]] MLA [[Adele Carles]], the Member for [[Electoral district of Fremantle|Fremantle]]. Buswell was re-appointed to the ministry in December 2010 as Minister for Transport and Minister for Housing, and regained the post of Treasurer in July 2012.\n\nAfter taking several days personal leave early in the month, he resigned from Cabinet on 10 March 2014.

He was educated at [[Busselton Senior High School]] and later attained a Bachelor of Economics at [[University of Western Australia]], where in 1986 he won the W.G. Salter Memorial Prize in Economics, which is awarded annually to the top student enrolled for the degree of Bachelor of Economics.\n\nBuswell worked for IBM Australia in a sales role in an early part of his career.\n\nIn 1992, he became the director of Villa Carlotta Group, which provided bus tours in the [[Busselton, Western Australia|Busselton]] region, and also became involved with the Cape Naturaliste Tourism Association. On 14 November 1992, he married Margaret Cummins, with whom he had two sons Jacob and Samuel.\n\nHe served as a councillor with the [[Shire of Busselton]] in 1995\u20131996, and again in 2001\u20132003, before becoming its Shire President at the 2003 local government elections. He stepped down to contest the [[2005 Western Australian state election|state election]] for the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] in the seat of [[Electoral district of Vasse|Vasse]], which is centred on Busselton. Some controversy arose over his preselection as he was chosen over the sitting member, [[Bernie Masters]], who blamed then-deputy leader [[Dan Sullivan (Australian politician)|Dan Sullivan]] for the decision, quit the party and ran for the seat as an independent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another top Lib walks out in anger|date=17 February 2004|last=Martin|first=Roger|work=[[The Australian]]|page=6}}</ref> However, Buswell won the contest by 209 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionswa.com/content/2CP_Vasse.htm|title=District of Vasse - Two Candidate Preferred Results, 26&nbsp;February 2005 State General Election|author=Western Australian Electoral Commission|date=30 November 2005|accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Deputy leadership==\n\nWith the unexpected resignation of Deputy Opposition Leader [[Paul Omodei]] in October 2005, Buswell was elected by the party room to replace Omodei in the role, serving under [[Matt Birney]]. Omodei went on to successful challenge for the leadership in March 2006, with Buswell remaining as deputy. By August 2007, polling numbers had fallen below 14%, and media commentators speculated that Omodei would be replaced with Buswell within six months if he could not improve polling by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Does anybody want to lead the Liberals?|last=Spagnolo|first=Joe|date=5 August 2007|work=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/09/2000913.htm|title=Omodei: Federal Liberal impacting on my polling|date=9 August 2007|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Online]]|accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Omodei under pressure|last=Burrell|first=Andrew|work=[[Australian Financial Review]]|page=14}}</ref> However, Buswell was being investigated by the [[Corruption and Crime Commission]] over allegations that he had met former Liberal powerbroker [[Noel Crichton-Browne]], who was working as a lobbyist in conjunction with former premier [[Brian Burke (Australian politician)|Brian Burke]], in a carpark to discuss the Canal Rocks development at Smiths Beach in [[Yallingup, Western Australia|Yallingup]] while he was still mayor of Busselton.

He was educated at [[Busselton Senior High School]] and later attained a Bachelor of Economics at [[University of Western Australia]], where in 1986 he won the W.G. Salter Memorial Prize in Economics, which is awarded annually to the top student enrolled for the degree of Bachelor of Economics.\n\nIn 1992, he became the director of Villa Carlotta Group, which provided bus tours in the [[Busselton, Western Australia|Busselton]] region, and also became involved with the Cape Naturaliste Tourism Association. On 14 November 1992, he married Margaret Cummins, with whom he had two sons Jacob and Samuel.\n\nHe served as a councillor with the [[Shire of Busselton]] in 1995\u20131996, and again in 2001\u20132003, before becoming its Shire President at the 2003 local government elections. He stepped down to contest the [[2005 Western Australian state election|state election]] for the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] in the seat of [[Electoral district of Vasse|Vasse]], which is centred on Busselton. Some controversy arose over his preselection as he was chosen over the sitting member, [[Bernie Masters]], who blamed then-deputy leader [[Dan Sullivan (Australian politician)|Dan Sullivan]] for the decision, quit the party and ran for the seat as an independent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another top Lib walks out in anger|date=17 February 2004|last=Martin|first=Roger|work=[[The Australian]]|page=6}}</ref> However, Buswell won the contest by 209 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionswa.com/content/2CP_Vasse.htm|title=District of Vasse - Two Candidate Preferred Results, 26&nbsp;February 2005 State General Election|author=Western Australian Electoral Commission|date=30 November 2005|accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Deputy leadership==\n\nWith the unexpected resignation of Deputy Opposition Leader [[Paul Omodei]] in October 2005, Buswell was elected by the party room to replace Omodei in the role, serving under [[Matt Birney]]. Omodei went on to successful challenge for the leadership in March 2006, with Buswell remaining as deputy. By August 2007, polling numbers had fallen below 14%, and media commentators speculated that Omodei would be replaced with Buswell within six months if he could not improve polling by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Does anybody want to lead the Liberals?|last=Spagnolo|first=Joe|date=5 August 2007|work=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/08/09/2000913.htm|title=Omodei: Federal Liberal impacting on my polling|date=9 August 2007|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Online]]|accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Omodei under pressure|last=Burrell|first=Andrew|work=[[Australian Financial Review]]|page=14}}</ref> However, Buswell was being investigated by the [[Corruption and Crime Commission]] over allegations that he had met former Liberal powerbroker [[Noel Crichton-Browne]], who was working as a lobbyist in conjunction with former premier [[Brian Burke (Australian politician)|Brian Burke]], in a carpark to discuss the Canal Rocks development at Smiths Beach in [[Yallingup, Western Australia|Yallingup]] while he was still mayor of Busselton.
