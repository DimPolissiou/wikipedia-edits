{"title_page": "Junk science", "text_new": "{{redirect|Sound science|the branch of physics|acoustics}}\n{{Further|Pseudoscience}}\n\nThe expression '''junk science''' is used to describe scientific [[data]], [[research]], or analysis considered by the person using the phrase to be [[wikt:spurious|spurious]] or [[fraud]]ulent. The concept is often invoked in political and legal contexts where facts and scientific results have a great amount of weight in making a determination.  It usually conveys a [[pejorative]] connotation that the research has been untowardly driven by political, ideological, financial, or otherwise unscientific motives.\n\nThe concept was popularized in the 1990s in relation to [[expert testimony]] in [[civil litigation]]. More recently, invoking the concept has been a tactic to criticize research on the harmful [[Environmentalism|environmental]] or [[public health]] effects of corporate activities, and occasionally in response to such criticism. The term has been used by proponents of both sides of such political debates. Author Dan Agin in his book ''[[Junk Science]]'' harshly criticized those who deny the basic premise of global warming,<ref name=\"Union-Tribune 2006-10-22\" /> while former [[Fox News]] commentator [[Steven Milloy]] has extensively denounced research linking the fossil fuel industry to climate change, on his website ''junkscience.com''.<ref name=\"Huffington Post 2014-03-06\" />\n\nIn some contexts, junk science is counterposed to the \"sound science\" or \"solid science\" that favors one's own point of view.<ref name=Neff2005>{{cite journal |vauthors= Neff RA, Goldman LR |title=Regulatory parallels to Daubert: stakeholder influence, \"sound science,\" and the delayed adoption of health-protective standards |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S81\u201391 |year=2005 |pmid=16030344 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.044818 |url= http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/full/95/S1/S81}}</ref> This dichotomy has been particularly promoted by Steven Milloy and the [[Advancement of Sound Science Center]], and is somewhat different from [[pseudoscience]] and [[fringe science]].\n\n==History==\nThe phrase ''junk science'' appears to have been in use prior to 1985. A 1985 [[United States Department of Justice]] report by the Tort Policy Working Group noted:\n<blockquote>The use of such invalid scientific evidence (commonly referred to as 'junk science') has resulted in findings of causation which simply cannot be justified or understood from the standpoint of the current state of credible scientific or medical knowledge.<ref>[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED274437 \"Report of the Tort Policy Working Group on the causes, extent and policy implications of the current crisis in insurance availability and affordability\"] (Rep. No. 027-000-01251-5). (1986, February). Washington, D.C.: Superintendent of Documents, US Government Printing Office. (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED274437) p.39: <blockquote>Another way in which causation often is undermined \u2014 also an increasingly serious problem in toxic tort cases \u2014 is the reliance by judges and juries on non-credible scientific or medical testimony, studies or opinions. It has become all too common for 'experts' or 'studies' on the fringes of or even well beyond the outer parameters of mainstream scientific or medical views to be presented to juries as valid evidence from which conclusions may be drawn. The use of such invalid scientific evidence (commonly referred to as 'junk science') has resulted in findings of causation which simply cannot be justified or understood from the standpoint of the current state of credible scientific and medical knowledge.  Most importantly, this development has led to a deep and growing cynicism about the ability of tort law to deal with difficult scientific and medical concepts in a principled and rational way.</blockquote></ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1989, the climate scientist [[Jerry Mahlman]] (Director of the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]) characterized the theory that [[global warming]] was due to [[solar variation]] (presented in ''Scientific Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem'' by [[Frederick Seitz]] et al.) as \"noisy junk science.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = L. | year = 1989 | title = Global warming: Blaming the sun | url = | journal = Science | volume = 246 | issue = 4933| pages = 992\u2013993 | doi=10.1126/science.246.4933.992 | pmid=17806372}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter W. Huber]] popularized the term with respect to litigation in his 1991 book ''Galileo's Revenge: Junk Science in the Courtroom.''  The book has been cited in over 100 legal textbooks and references; as a consequence, some sources cite Huber as the first to coin the term.  By 1997, the term had entered the legal lexicon as seen in an opinion by [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]: \n<blockquote>An example of 'junk science' that should be excluded under the [[Daubert standard]] as too unreliable would be the testimony of a [[phrenologist]] who would purport to prove a defendant's future dangerousness based on the contours of the defendant's skull.<ref>''[[General Electric Company]] v. Robert K. Joiner'', No. 96\u2013188, slip op. at 4 (U.S. December 15, 1997).</ref></blockquote> Lower courts have subsequently set guidelines for identifying junk science, such as the 2005 opinion of [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook|Easterbrook]]:\n<blockquote>Positive reports about magnetic water treatment are not replicable; this plus the lack of a physical explanation for any effects are hallmarks of junk science.<ref>{{cite book| last= Huber| first= P. W. | year= 1991| edition= 2001| title= Galileo's revenge: Junk science in the courtroom| url= https://archive.org/details/galileosrevenge00pete| url-access= registration| place= New York| publisher= Basic Books| page= [https://archive.org/details/galileosrevenge00pete/page/191 191]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the subtitle of Huber's book, ''Junk Science in the Courtroom'', suggests, his emphasis was on the use or misuse of expert testimony in civil litigation.  One prominent example cited in the book was litigation over casual contact in the spread of [[AIDS]]. A California school district sought to prevent a young boy with AIDS, Ryan Thomas, from attending [[kindergarten]]. The school district produced an expert witness, Steven Armentrout, who testified that a possibility existed that AIDS could be transmitted to schoolmates through yet undiscovered \"vectors.\" However, five experts testified on behalf of Thomas that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact, and the court affirmed the \"solid science\" (as Huber called it) and rejected Armentrout's argument.<ref>''Charles H. Sanderson v. [[Culligan International Company]]'', No. 04-3253, slip op. at 3 (7th Cir. July 11, 2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and others advocated public policies to improve the dissemination of valid environmental scientific knowledge and discourage junk science: \n<blockquote>The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reports offer an antidote to junk science by articulating the current consensus on the prospects for climate change, by outlining the extent of the uncertainties, and by describing the potential benefits and costs of policies to address climate change.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= Ehrlich| first1= P.

In the first case, Agin discussed falsified results in the development of organic transistors: \n<blockquote>As far as understanding junk science is concerned, the important aspect is that both Bell Laboratories and the international physics community were fooled until someone noticed that noise records published by [[Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n]] in several papers were identical\u2014which means physically impossible.{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=39}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the second case, he cites an example that demonstrates ignorance of statistical principles in the lay press: \n<blockquote>Since no such proof is possible [that [[genetically modified food]] is harmless], the article in The New York Times was what is called a \"bad rap\" against the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014a bad rap based on a junk-science belief that it's possible to prove a [[null hypothesis]].{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=63}}</blockquote>\n\nAgin asks the reader to step back from the rhetoric, as \"how things are labeled does not make a science junk science.\"{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=249}} In its place, he offers that junk science is ultimately motivated by the desire to hide undesirable truths from the public.\n\n==Use as corporate PR==\n{{see|corporate communication|public relations}}\n[[John Stauber]] and [[Sheldon Rampton]] of ''[[PR Watch]]'' say the concept of junk science has come to be invoked in attempts to dismiss scientific findings that stand in the way of short-term corporate profits. In their book ''[[Trust Us, We're Experts]]'' (2001), they write that industries have launched multimillion-dollar campaigns to position certain theories as junk science in the popular mind, often failing to employ the [[scientific method]] themselves. For example, the [[tobacco industry]] has described research demonstrating the harmful effects of smoking and [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] as junk science, through the vehicle of various [[astroturfing|astroturf groups]].\n\nTheories more favorable to corporate activities are portrayed in words as \"sound science.\" Past examples where \"sound science\" was used include the research into the toxicity of [[Alar]], which was heavily criticized by antiregulatory advocates, and [[Herbert Needleman]]'s research into low dose [[lead poisoning]]. Needleman was accused of fraud and personally attacked.<ref name=Neff2005/>\n\n[[Fox News]] commentator [[Steven Milloy]] often invokes the concept of junk science to attack the results of credible scientific research on topics like [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]], and [[passive smoking]]. The credibility of Milloy's website junkscience.com was questioned by [[Paul D. Thacker]], a writer for ''[[The New Republic]]'', in the wake of evidence that Milloy had received funding from [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJR Tobacco]], and [[Exxon Mobil]].<ref name=\"tnr\">[http://www.tnr.com/article/pundit-hire \"Smoked Out: Pundit For Hire\"], published in ''The New Republic'', accessed 24 November 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Sheldon |last1=Rampton |authorlink1=Sheldon Rampton |first2=John |last2=Stauber |authorlink2=John Stauber |url=http://www.prwatch.org/files/pdfs/prwatch/prwv7n3.pdf |title=How Big Tobacco Helped Create 'the Junkman' |volume=7 |issue=3 |work=PR Watch |date=2000 |publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]]}}</ref><ref name=\"rjrmemo\">[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/syq70d00 Activity Report], R.J.

Most importantly, this development has led to a deep and growing cynicism about the ability of tort law to deal with difficult scientific and medical concepts in a principled and rational way.</blockquote></ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1989, the climate scientist [[Jerry Mahlman]] (Director of the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]) characterized the theory that [[global warming]] was due to [[solar variation]] (presented in ''Scientific Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem'' by [[Frederick Seitz]] et al.) as \"noisy junk science.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = L. | year = 1989 | title = Global warming: Blaming the sun | url = | journal = Science | volume = 246 | issue = 4933| pages = 992\u2013993 | doi=10.1126/science.246.4933.992 | pmid=17806372}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter W. Huber]] popularized the term with respect to litigation in his 1991 book ''Galileo's Revenge: Junk Science in the Courtroom.''  The book has been cited in over 100 legal textbooks and references; as a consequence, some sources cite Huber as the first to coin the term.  By 1997, the term had entered the legal lexicon as seen in an opinion by [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]: \n<blockquote>An example of 'junk science' that should be excluded under the [[Daubert standard]] as too unreliable would be the testimony of a [[phrenologist]] who would purport to prove a defendant's future dangerousness based on the contours of the defendant's skull.<ref>''[[General Electric Company]] v. Robert K. Joiner'', No. 96\u2013188, slip op. at 4 (U.S. December 15, 1997).</ref></blockquote> Lower courts have subsequently set guidelines for identifying junk science, such as the 2005 opinion of [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] Judge [[Frank H. Easterbrook|Easterbrook]]:\n<blockquote>Positive reports about magnetic water treatment are not replicable; this plus the lack of a physical explanation for any effects are hallmarks of junk science.<ref>{{cite book| last= Huber| first= P. W. | year= 1991| edition= 2001| title= Galileo's revenge: Junk science in the courtroom| url= https://archive.org/details/galileosrevenge00pete| url-access= registration| place= New York| publisher= Basic Books| page= [https://archive.org/details/galileosrevenge00pete/page/191 191]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the subtitle of Huber's book, ''Junk Science in the Courtroom'', suggests, his emphasis was on the use or misuse of expert testimony in civil litigation.  One prominent example cited in the book was litigation over casual contact in the spread of [[AIDS]]. A California school district sought to prevent a young boy with AIDS, Ryan Thomas, from attending [[kindergarten]]. The school district produced an expert witness, Steven Armentrout, who testified that a possibility existed that AIDS could be transmitted to schoolmates through yet undiscovered \"vectors.\" However, five experts testified on behalf of Thomas that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact, and the court affirmed the \"solid science\" (as Huber called it) and rejected Armentrout's argument.<ref>''Charles H. Sanderson v. [[Culligan International Company]]'', No. 04-3253, slip op. at 3 (7th Cir. July 11, 2005).</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and others advocated public policies to improve the dissemination of valid environmental scientific knowledge and discourage junk science: \n<blockquote>The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reports offer an antidote to junk science by articulating the current consensus on the prospects for climate change, by outlining the extent of the uncertainties, and by describing the potential benefits and costs of policies to address climate change.<ref>{{cite journal| last1= Ehrlich| first1= P.

In the first case, Agin discussed falsified results in the development of organic transistors: \n<blockquote>As far as understanding junk science is concerned, the important aspect is that both Bell Laboratories and the international physics community were fooled until someone noticed that noise records published by [[Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n]] in several papers were identical\u2014which means physically impossible.{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=39}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the second case, he cites an example that demonstrates ignorance of statistical principles in the lay press: \n<blockquote>Since no such proof is possible [that [[genetically modified food]] is harmless], the article in The New York Times was what is called a \"bad rap\" against the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014a bad rap based on a junk-science belief that it's possible to prove a [[null hypothesis]].{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=63}}</blockquote>\n\nAgin asks the reader to step back from the rhetoric, as \"how things are labeled does not make a science junk science.\"{{sfn|Agin|2006|p=249}} In its place, he offers that junk science is ultimately motivated by the desire to hide undesirable truths from the public.\n\n==Use as corporate PR==\n{{see|corporate communication|public relations}}\n[[John Stauber]] and [[Sheldon Rampton]] of ''[[PR Watch]]'' say the concept of junk science has come to be invoked in attempts to dismiss scientific findings that stand in the way of short-term corporate profits. In their book ''[[Trust Us, We're Experts]]'' (2001), they write that industries have launched multimillion-dollar campaigns to position certain theories as junk science in the popular mind, often failing to employ the [[scientific method]] themselves. For example, the [[tobacco industry]] has described research demonstrating the harmful effects of smoking and [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] as junk science, through the vehicle of various [[astroturfing|astroturf groups]].\n\nTheories more favorable to corporate activities are portrayed in words as \"sound science.\" Past examples where \"sound science\" was used include the research into the toxicity of [[Alar]], which was heavily criticized by antiregulatory advocates, and [[Herbert Needleman]]'s research into low dose [[lead poisoning]]. Needleman was accused of fraud and personally attacked.<ref name=Neff2005/>\n\n[[Fox News]] commentator [[Steven Milloy]] often invokes the concept of junk science to attack the results of credible scientific research on topics like [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]], and [[passive smoking]]. The credibility of Milloy's website junkscience.com was questioned by [[Paul D. Thacker]], a writer for ''[[The New Republic]]'', in the wake of evidence that Milloy had received funding from [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJR Tobacco]], and [[Exxon Mobil]].<ref name=\"tnr\">[http://www.tnr.com/article/pundit-hire \"Smoked Out: Pundit For Hire\"], published in ''The New Republic'', accessed 24 November 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Sheldon |last1=Rampton |authorlink1=Sheldon Rampton |first2=John |last2=Stauber |authorlink2=John Stauber |url=http://www.prwatch.org/files/pdfs/prwatch/prwv7n3.pdf |title=How Big Tobacco Helped Create 'the Junkman' |volume=7 |issue=3 |work=PR Watch |date=2000 |publisher=[[Center for Media and Democracy]]}}</ref><ref name=\"rjrmemo\">[http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/syq70d00 Activity Report], R.J.

Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]\". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia.\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do so until her dying day.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}\n\nBy the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either\".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was \"the best singer in the business\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had \"perfected the art of intimacy.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Frank Sinatra Reader|last = White|first = John|year = 1996|journal = Journal of American Studies|access-date = }}</ref> According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a \"fairly rangy voice\",{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C. Sinatra could \"surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low E at 0:41 in the recording of \"[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]\" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that \"His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

If someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible.\"|source=\u2014Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}\nSinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a \"brooding melancholy\", such as \"[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]\", \"[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]\", \"[[My One and Only Love]]\" and \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists\". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art\".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}\n\n== Film career ==\n{{See also|Frank Sinatra filmography}}\n\n=== Debut, musical films, and career slump (1941\u20131952) ===\n\n[[File:Frank Sinatra in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\n\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s.

Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]\". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia.\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do so until her dying day.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}\n\nBy the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either\".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=45}}  As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby,{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=56}} but later believed that [[Tony Bennett]] was \"the best singer in the business\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=98}} Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had \"perfected the art of intimacy.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Frank Sinatra Reader|last = White|first = John|year = 1996|journal = Journal of American Studies|access-date = }}</ref> According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a \"fairly rangy voice\",{{efn|Riddle notes that Sinatra's range was from the low G to the high F, almost two octaves, but that his practical range was the low A-flat to a D, in comparison to Bing Crosby whose range was G to C. Sinatra could \"surpass him by probably as much as four tones at the top\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Though Riddle stated that Sinatra's lowest was G, he often hit the low F in concerts, and hit the low E at 0:41 in the recording of \"[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]\" for the 1955 album ''In the Wee Small Hours''.}}  remarking that \"His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a very tender sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

If someone told him he'd been great, he'd reply, 'It was a nice crowd, but my reed was off' or 'I wasn't so good on the third number'. Strangely, in spite of his hearing problems, he had the most incredible ear, which often drove those he worked with nuts. There could be an orchestra of a hundred musicians, and if one played a bum note he'd know exactly who was responsible.\"|source=\u2014Barbara Sinatra on Sinatra's voice and musical understanding.{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=240}}}}\nSinatra's split with Gardner in the fall of 1953 had a profound impact on the types of songs he sang and on his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a \"brooding melancholy\", such as \"[[I'm a Fool to Want You]]\", \"[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me]]\", \"[[My One and Only Love]]\" and \"[[There Will Never Be Another You]]\",{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=232}} which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists\". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art\".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}\n\n== Film career ==\n{{See also|Frank Sinatra filmography}}\n\n=== Debut, musical films, and career slump (1941\u20131952) ===\n\n[[File:Frank Sinatra in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\n\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s.

The city's history dates to before 2000 BC.]]\nUnlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] (modern Bo\u011fazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the [[Hittite language]], or ''nesili'' (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of [[K\u00fcltepe|Nesa]] around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan theory]] on the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European [[ancient Anatolians]]) were themselves relatively recent [[Indo-European migrations|immigrants]] to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically, they would rather assimilate into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language.\n\n[[File:14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC]]\nThe Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform script]], invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the [[Hittites#New Kingdom|Hittite New Kingdom]], which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the south-east and the defeat of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal [[Kaskians]], had established themselves there, displacing earlier [[Palaic language|Palaic-speaking]] Indo-Europeans.<ref>Carruba, O.

The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Medes|Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.\n\n====Cimmerian and Scythian invasions (8th\u20137th centuries BC)====\nFrom the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]].

As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.\n\nA continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, [[Constantinople]] and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.\n\nAnatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]).

Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Of the remainder, most have left Turkey since then, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today.

The city's history dates to before 2000 BC.]]\nUnlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] (modern Bo\u011fazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the [[Hittite language]], or ''nesili'' (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of [[K\u00fcltepe|Nesa]] around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan theory]] on the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European [[ancient Anatolians]]) were themselves relatively recent [[Indo-European migrations|immigrants]] to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically, they would rather assimilate into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language.\n\n[[File:14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC]]\nThe Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform script]], invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the [[Hittites#New Kingdom|Hittite New Kingdom]], which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the south-east and the defeat of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal [[Kaskians]], had established themselves there, displacing earlier [[Palaic language|Palaic-speaking]] Indo-Europeans.<ref>Carruba, O.

[[Luwian language|Their language]] belonged to the same linguistic branch as [[Hittite language|Hittite]].<ref>Melchert 2003</ref> The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the [[Gediz River|Hermos]] and/or [[Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay|Kaikos]] valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley.<ref>Watkins 1994; id. 1995:144\u201351; Starke 1997; Melchert 2003; for the geography Hawkins 1998</ref> From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]], all of which had [[Greece|Hellenic]] influence.\n\n====Neo-Assyrian Empire (10th\u20137th centuries BC)====\nFrom the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the southeastern regions) fell to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], including all of the [[Syro-Hittite states]], [[Tabal]], [[Kingdom of Commagene]], the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and swathes of [[Cappadocia]].\n\nThe Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], Scythians and their own [[Babylonia]]n relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Medes|Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.\n\n====Cimmerian and Scythian invasions (8th\u20137th centuries BC)====\nFrom the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]].

In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia.

As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.\n\nA continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, [[Constantinople]] and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.\n\nAnatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Of the remainder, most have left Turkey since then, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has been within Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of Turkey}}\nAnatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[K\u0131z\u0131l River]], the coastal plains of [[\u00c7ukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around [[Lake Tuz]] (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').\n\nThere are two mountain ranges in southern Anatolia: the [[Taurus mountains|Taurus]] and the [[Zagros]] mountains.<ref name=wiley>{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley & Sons| isbn = 978-1-118-94501-8| last1 = Cemen| first1 = Ibrahim| last2 = Yilmaz| first2 = Yucel| title = Active Global Seismology: Neotectonics and Earthquake Potential of the Eastern Mediterranean Region| date = 3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Turkey}}\n<gallery caption=\"Temperatures of Anatolia\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Klima_ankara.png|[[Ankara]] (central Anatolia)\nFile:Klima_antalya.png|[[Antalya]] (southern Anatolia)\nFile:Klima_van.png|[[Van, Turkey|Van]] (eastern Anatolia)\n</gallery>\n\nAnatolia has a varied range of climates.

Retrieved on January 11, 2000.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nBy her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in [[Austin]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], concentrating on a folk-rock-country blend. She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album, for [[Smithsonian]]/[[Folkways Records]]. Titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. The album title was shortened to ''[[Ramblin']]'' when it was reissued. She followed it up in 1980 with ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.\n\nIn the 1980s, Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club. In 1988 [[Rough Trade Records]] released the self-titled ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', which was produced by [[Gurf Morlix]]. The single \"Changed the Locks\", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including [[Tom Petty]], who would later cover the song.\n\nIts follow-up, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'' (Chameleon, 1992), also produced by Morlix, is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams' biggest success during the early 1990s was as a songwriter. [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] recorded a cover of \"[[Passionate Kisses]]\" (from ''Lucinda Williams'') in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994. Carpenter also received a Grammy for her performance of the song. She duetted with [[Steve Earle]] on the song \"You're Still Standin' There\" from his album ''[[I Feel Alright]]''. In 1991, the song \"Lucinda Williams\" appeared on [[Vic Chesnutt]]'s album ''West of Rome''.\n\nWilliams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. [[Emmylou Harris]] said of Williams, \"She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss.\" Harris recorded the title track from Williams's ''Sweet Old World'' for her career-redefining 1995 album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''.\n\nWilliams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.\n\n===''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''===\nThe long-awaited release, 1998's ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', was Williams' breakthrough into the mainstream and received a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Containing the single \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" from the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. The single \"Can't Let Go\" also enjoyed considerable crossover radio play. Williams toured with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[The Allman Brothers|Allman Brothers]] and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and on her own in support of the album.  An expanded edition of the album, including three additional studio recordings and a second CD documenting a 1998 concert, was released in 2006.\n\nIn 1999, she appeared on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', duetting with [[David Crosby]] on the title track of the tribute album.\n\nWilliams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' (2001). This release features a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2001 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single \"Get Right with God,\" an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release.  The title track includes a contribution on a Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]].\n\nHer seventh album, ''[[World Without Tears]]'', was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.\n\n===Recent work===\n\n[[File:Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016.jpg|thumb|438x438px|Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016]]\n\nWilliams was a guest vocalist on the song \"Factory Girls\" from Irish punk-folk band [[Flogging Molly]]'s 2004 album, \"[[Within a Mile of Home]],\" and appeared on [[Elvis Costello]]'s ''[[The Delivery Man]]''. She sings with folk legend [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] on the track \"Careless Darling\" from his 2006 release \"I Stand Alone.\"\n\nIn 2006, Williams recorded a version of the [[John Hartford]] classic \"[[Gentle on My Mind (song)|Gentle on My Mind]],\" which played over the [[closing credits]] of the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Williams released ''[[West (Lucinda Williams album)|West]]'', for which she wrote more than 27 songs. The album was released on February 13, 2007. It addresses her mother's death and a tumultuous relationship break-up. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' praised it, saying \"Lucinda Williams has made the record of a lifetime\u2014part [[Hank Williams]], part Bob Dylan, part [[Keith Richards]] circa ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' ...\"\n\nIn the fall of 2007, Williams announced a series of shows in Los Angeles and New York. Playing five nights in each city, she performed her entire catalog on consecutive nights.  These albums include the self-titled ''Lucinda Williams'', ''Sweet Old World'', ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', and ''[[World Without Tears]]''. Each night also featured a second set with special guest stars. Some of the many special guests included [[Steve Earle]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], [[Greg Dulli]], [[Mark Oliver Everett|E]], [[Ann Wilson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[David Byrne]], [[David Johansen]], [[Yo la Tengo]], [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]], [[Chuck Prophet]], [[Jim Lauderdale]] and [[Shelby Lynne]]. In addition, each night's album set was recorded and made available to the attendees that night. These live recordings are currently available on her website and at her shows.\n\nThe next album from Williams wrapped recording in March 2008. Titled ''[[Little Honey]]'', it was released on October 14 of that year. It includes 13 songs\u2014among them, \"Real Love\" and \"Little Rock Star,\" the latter inspired by music celebrities in the press, like [[Pete Doherty]] and [[Amy Winehouse]]. \"Little Honey\" also includes a cover of AC/DC's \"Long Way to the Top\" and \"Rarity,\" inspired by singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd.<ref>Gamboa, Glenn.

In 1988, she released her self-titled album, ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]''. This release featured \"[[Passionate Kisses]],\" a song later recorded by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], which garnered Williams her first [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994.\n\nKnown for working slowly, Williams recorded and released only one other album in the next several years, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'', in 1992. Her commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and [[Americana music|Americana]] into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', which includes the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy nominated]] track \"Can't Let Go\", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and earned Williams a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams released the critically acclaimed ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' three years later, and the album also became a commercial success. One of the album's tracks, \"Get Right with God,\" earned Williams the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] in 2002.\n\nWilliams has released a string of albums since that have earned her more critical acclaim and commercial success. She has won 3 [[Grammy Awards]], from 15 nominations, and received 2 [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Awards]], from 12 nominations.

Retrieved on January 11, 2000.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nBy her early 20s, Williams was playing publicly in [[Austin]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], concentrating on a folk-rock-country blend. She moved to [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], in 1978 to record her first album, for [[Smithsonian]]/[[Folkways Records]]. Titled ''[[Ramblin' on My Mind]]'', it was a collection of country and [[blues]] covers. The album title was shortened to ''[[Ramblin']]'' when it was reissued. She followed it up in 1980 with ''[[Happy Woman Blues]]'', which consisted of her own material. Neither album received much attention.\n\nIn the 1980s, Williams moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (before finally settling in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]), where, at times backed by a rock band and at others performing in acoustic settings, she developed a following and a critical reputation. While based in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to [[The Long Ryders|Long Ryders]] drummer [[Greg Sowders]], whom she had met in a club. In 1988 [[Rough Trade Records]] released the self-titled ''[[Lucinda Williams (album)|Lucinda Williams]]'', which was produced by [[Gurf Morlix]]. The single \"Changed the Locks\", about a broken relationship, received radio play around the country and gained fans among music insiders, including [[Tom Petty]], who would later cover the song.\n\nIts follow-up, ''[[Sweet Old World]]'' (Chameleon, 1992), also produced by Morlix, is a melancholy album dealing with themes of suicide and death. Williams' biggest success during the early 1990s was as a songwriter. [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] recorded a cover of \"[[Passionate Kisses]]\" (from ''Lucinda Williams'') in 1992, and the song became a smash country hit for which Williams received the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]] in 1994. Carpenter also received a Grammy for her performance of the song. She duetted with [[Steve Earle]] on the song \"You're Still Standin' There\" from his album ''[[I Feel Alright]]''. In 1991, the song \"Lucinda Williams\" appeared on [[Vic Chesnutt]]'s album ''West of Rome''.\n\nWilliams had garnered considerable critical acclaim, but her commercial success was moderate. [[Emmylou Harris]] said of Williams, \"She is an example of the best of what country at least says it is, but, for some reason, she's completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss.\" Harris recorded the title track from Williams's ''Sweet Old World'' for her career-redefining 1995 album, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''.\n\nWilliams also gained a reputation as a perfectionist and slow worker when it came to recording; six years would pass before her next album release, though she appeared as a guest on other artists' albums and contributed to several tribute compilations during this period.\n\n===''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''===\nThe long-awaited release, 1998's ''[[Car Wheels on a Gravel Road]]'', was Williams' breakthrough into the mainstream and received a [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]]. Containing the single \"Still I Long for Your Kiss\" from the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', the album received wide critical notice and soon went gold. The single \"Can't Let Go\" also enjoyed considerable crossover radio play. Williams toured with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[The Allman Brothers|Allman Brothers]] and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and on her own in support of the album.  An expanded edition of the album, including three additional studio recordings and a second CD documenting a 1998 concert, was released in 2006.\n\nIn 1999, she appeared on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', duetting with [[David Crosby]] on the title track of the tribute album.\n\nWilliams followed up the success of ''Car Wheels'' with ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'' (2001). This release features a less produced, more down-tuned approach both musically and lyrically, and moved Williams further from the country music establishment while winning fans in the alternative music world. She won the 2001 [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single \"Get Right with God,\" an atypically uptempo gospel-rock tune from the otherwise rather low-key release.  The title track includes a contribution on a Hammond organ by [[alternative country]] musician [[Ryan Adams]].\n\nHer seventh album, ''[[World Without Tears]]'', was released in 2003. A musically adventurous though lyrically downbeat album, this release found Williams experimenting with talking blues stylings and electric blues.\n\n===Recent work===\n\n[[File:Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016.jpg|thumb|438x438px|Lucinda Williams at a Lincoln Center Out Of Doors concert in New York City, August 2016]]\n\nWilliams was a guest vocalist on the song \"Factory Girls\" from Irish punk-folk band [[Flogging Molly]]'s 2004 album, \"[[Within a Mile of Home]],\" and appeared on [[Elvis Costello]]'s ''[[The Delivery Man]]''. She sings with folk legend [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] on the track \"Careless Darling\" from his 2006 release \"I Stand Alone.\"\n\nIn 2006, Williams recorded a version of the [[John Hartford]] classic \"[[Gentle on My Mind (song)|Gentle on My Mind]],\" which played over the [[closing credits]] of the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Williams released ''[[West (Lucinda Williams album)|West]]'', for which she wrote more than 27 songs. The album was released on February 13, 2007. It addresses her mother's death and a tumultuous relationship break-up. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' praised it, saying \"Lucinda Williams has made the record of a lifetime\u2014part [[Hank Williams]], part Bob Dylan, part [[Keith Richards]] circa ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' ...\"\n\nIn the fall of 2007, Williams announced a series of shows in Los Angeles and New York. Playing five nights in each city, she performed her entire catalog on consecutive nights.  These albums include the self-titled ''Lucinda Williams'', ''Sweet Old World'', ''Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'', ''[[Essence (Lucinda Williams album)|Essence]]'', and ''[[World Without Tears]]''. Each night also featured a second set with special guest stars. Some of the many special guests included [[Steve Earle]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], [[Greg Dulli]], [[Mark Oliver Everett|E]], [[Ann Wilson]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[David Byrne]], [[David Johansen]], [[Yo la Tengo]], [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]], [[Chuck Prophet]], [[Jim Lauderdale]] and [[Shelby Lynne]]. In addition, each night's album set was recorded and made available to the attendees that night. These live recordings are currently available on her website and at her shows.\n\nThe next album from Williams wrapped recording in March 2008. Titled ''[[Little Honey]]'', it was released on October 14 of that year. It includes 13 songs\u2014among them, \"Real Love\" and \"Little Rock Star,\" the latter inspired by music celebrities in the press, like [[Pete Doherty]] and [[Amy Winehouse]]. \"Little Honey\" also includes a cover of AC/DC's \"Long Way to the Top\" and \"Rarity,\" inspired by singer-songwriter Mia Doi Todd.<ref>Gamboa, Glenn.
