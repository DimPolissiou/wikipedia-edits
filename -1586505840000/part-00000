The central area of the village is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Cold Spring Historic District]] due to its many well-[[historic preservation|preserved]] 19th-century buildings, constructed to accommodate workers at the nearby [[West Point Foundry]] (itself a Registered Historic Place today). The town is the birthplace of General [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], who was an important figure in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The village, located in the [[Hudson Highlands]], sits at the deepest point of the Hudson River, directly across from [[West Point]]. Cold Spring serves as a weekend getaway for many residents of [[New York City]].\n\nCommuter service to [[New York City]] is available via the [[Cold Spring (Metro-North station)|Cold Spring train station]], served by [[Metro-North Railroad]]. The train journey is about an hour and ten minutes to [[Grand Central Terminal]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early industry===\nThe site of present-day Cold Spring was part of the lands belonging to [[Adolphus Philipse]]. The first settler of Cold Spring was Thomas Davenport in 1730. In 1772 a highway master was chosen for the road from Cold Spring to the Post Road from New York to Albany. A small trading hamlet grew alongside the river by the early 1800s.<ref name=vocs>[http://coldspringny.gov/Pages/coldspringny_webdocs/cshistory \"A History of Cold Spring\", Village of Cold Spring, New York]</ref> A couple of sloops made regular weekly trips from Cold Spring to New York, carrying wood and some country produce, which came over this model road from the east. Those trips by sloop usually took a week.\n\nIn 1818 [[Gouverneur Kemble]] established the [[West Point Foundry]] opposite [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] to produce artillery pieces for the United States Government. The nearbys mountains contained veins of ore, and were covered with timber for fuel. A brook provided hydropower, and the Hudson a ready shipping outlet. In 1843, the Foundry built the ''USS Spencer'', the first iron ship built in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/January-2014/History-and-Preservation-of-the-West-Point-Foundry-in-Cold-Spring/ Levine, David. \"History and Preservation of the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring\", ''Hudson Valley Magazine'', December 24, 2013]</ref> With the influx of workers at the Foundry, local housing, businesses and churches increased, and Cold Spring was incorporated as a village in 1846. The first President of the Village was Joshua Haight. The Foundry became famous for its production of [[Parrott rifle]]s and other munitions during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the foundry grew to a sprawling 100-acre complex employing 1,400. It also manufactured cast iron steam engines for locomotives, gears, and produced much of the pipework for New York's water system. The rise of steel making and the declining demand for cast iron after the Civil War caused the Foundry to cease operations in 1911.<ref name=\"NysNrhpNom\">{{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/| archive-url = https://archive.today/20150701003048/http://cris.parks.ny.gov/| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2015-07-01| title = Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)| publisher = [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2015-11-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&id=31127&q=false| title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: West Point Foundry| accessdate = 2015-11-01| author = Lynn Beebe Weaver| format = PDF| date = November 1972}} and [https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&id=31126&q=false ''Accompanying photographs'']</ref>\n\nMany artifacts from the Foundry's history can be viewed at the Putnam History Museum on Chestnut Street.

The premises was shared by Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Baptists. The Methodists used a private home. Once every three weeks Rev. Owens from Patterson came to minister to the Presbyterians. Elder Warren from Kent cared for the religious needs of the Baptists. In the absence of an ordained minister, services were occasionally conducted by Foundry President Gouverneur Kemble. 1826 the Union Church was built. The celebrated preacher [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]] from Brooklyn is reported to have sometimes officiated there. The sacramental vessels were of pewter. By mutual agreement the Presbyterians used the building in the morning and the other religious groups in the afternoon. In 1830 the Baptists constructed a church on land donated by [[Samuel L. Gouverneur]].\n\nThe first Methodist church was built in 1833<ref name=Floyd>[https://archive.org/stream/stmaryschurchinh00floy#page/n41/mode/2up Floyd-Jones, Elbert.

O'Reilly raised money to build a church and Foundry owner Gouverneur Kemble, an Episcopalian, donated the land and funds.

Test firing from the Foundry damaged the chapel walls, and Captain [[Robert P. Parrott]], the then Foundry superintendent paid for repairs. Victorian additions altered the building's integrity, and the coming of the railroad cut it off from the rest of the village. The church was abandoned in 1906 and fell into disrepair. A fire caused further damage in 1927. In 1971 a group of interested persons, including actress [[Helen Hayes]], purchased it from the Archdiocese of New York and undertook restoration. The work was overseen by architect Walter Knight Sturges, and the chapel was dedicated as an ecumenical site in 1977.<ref>[http://www.chapelrestoration.org/history.html \"History\", Chapel Restoration]</ref>\n\nIn the 1900s Our Lady of Loretto had mission stations in Garrison and Manitou.

It was built as the estate of Frederick Lente, surgeon at the nearby West Point Foundry and later a founder of the American Academy of Medicine, in the mid-19th century. The Italian-villa design, popular at the time, was by the prominent architect Richard Upjohn. After death of Mrs. Lente in 1901 it was inherited by Patrick Connick, pastor of Our Lady of Loretto, and became a convalescent home for priests. The home was run by the Sisters of Charity. It was later converted into a convent for the Franciscan Sisters who taught at the parish school which was opened in 1913 and remained in operation until 1977. In 2008 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n===Saint Mary's in the Highlands===\nThe early Episcopal congregation was served by clergy from St. Philips in Garrison. In 1835 the Rev. Charles Lucke conducted services in Cold Spring. He was followed by Rev. Henry L. Storrs and then Rev. Edward C. Bull. In 1839 a number of English immigrants arrived to work at the Foundry. Members of the Church of England, the need for a formal Episcopal parish became apparent. Messrs Kemble and Parrott were chosen church wardens. Rev. Ebenezer Williams was the first pastor.<ref name=Floyd/>\n\nThe parish was incorporated on June 19, 1840. It is generally believed that the name of the parish was suggested by Parrott's wife Mary, who provided the funds to build the church. On June 30, Bishop [[Benjamin T. Onderdonk]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]] laid the cornerstone. That same year Rev. Williams recorded twenty-five burials, noting the prevalence of sickness in the area. The Gothic brick church, with a tower whose bell weighed 910 pounds, was completed in 1841 and consecrated in November. Besides Bishop Onderdonk, also in attendance were: Rev. John Brown of St. George's Newburgh, Rev. Moses Marcey of St. Peter's Peekskill, and Rev. Freeman Clarkson of St. Anna's of [[Beacon, New York|Fishkill Landing]].<ref name=Floyd/>\n\nA second larger church was built in 1867. Designed in the Victorian Gothic style by architect and vestry member George Edward Harney, and built under the direction of Sylvanus Ferris on land donated by Robert Parrott, it was completed the following year. It was constructed of gray granite donated by the estate of F.P. James. Situated at Main and Chestnut Streets, the church has a commanding view overlooking the village and river. The consecration of the church took place in a ceremony led by Bishop Horatio Potter on July 23, 1869. On that day the great bell in the tower, weighing 1,100 pounds, rang for the first time.<ref name=history>{{Cite web |url=http://stmaryscoldspring.org/history.html |title=\"History\", The Episcopal Church of St Mary-in-the-Highlands |access-date=2016-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219005524/http://stmaryscoldspring.org/history.html |archive-date=2016-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInitially Sunday school classes were conducted in the basement of the church which proved too dark, damp and cold for the children. Harney and Ferris completed St. Mary's Parish Hall in 1874. The hall was the gift of Frederick and Julia James to honor the memory of their sons Frederick and Julian, who both served in the Union army during the Civil War.<ref name=history/>\n\nA fire broke out in the north transept in July 1961 causing significant damage to the church's roof and interior. The chancel roof was completely destroyed and the transept roofs were badly burned. The original organ and most of the stained glass were lost while the furniture fortunately survived with little damage. The church was restored within a year and rededicated in 1962 by Bishop Horace W. B. Donegan.

The valley between them has an abandoned dairy farm, two lakes, and a camp. The view from the river bank is the Constitution Marsh and the [[US Military Academy]] (West Point) slightly to the south, and Crow's Nest and [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] to the west and northwest. All of this considered, the village is nestled in the most prominent vertical terrain on the Hudson River north of New York City prior to the [[Shawangunk Ridge|Shawangunk]] and [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] ranges. Being bound by these formidable terrain features has kept the size of the village small, and prevented the suburban sprawl that has come about in the less-constrained regions to the north and south and in the New York Metropolitan area generally. This unique sense of place, and the village's historic housing stock, have made it a very popular weekend destination for tourists from [[New York City]].

The central area of the village is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Cold Spring Historic District]] due to its many well-[[historic preservation|preserved]] 19th-century buildings, constructed to accommodate workers at the nearby [[West Point Foundry]] (itself a Registered Historic Place today). The town is the birthplace of General [[Gouverneur K. Warren]], who was an important figure in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The village, located in the [[Hudson Highlands]], sits at the deepest point of the Hudson River, directly across from [[West Point]]. Cold Spring serves as a weekend getaway for many residents of [[New York City]].\n\nCommuter service to [[New York City]] is available via the [[Cold Spring (Metro-North station)|Cold Spring train station]], served by [[Metro-North Railroad]]. The train journey is about an hour and ten minutes to [[Grand Central Terminal]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early industry===\nThe site of present-day Cold Spring was part of the lands belonging to [[Adolphus Philipse]]. The first settler of Cold Spring was Thomas Davenport in 1730. In 1772 a highway master was chosen for the road from Cold Spring to the Post Road from New York to Albany. A small trading hamlet grew alongside the river by the early 1800s.<ref name=vocs>[http://coldspringny.gov/Pages/coldspringny_webdocs/cshistory \"A History of Cold Spring\", Village of Cold Spring, New York]</ref> A couple of sloops made regular weekly trips from Cold Spring to New York, carrying wood and some country produce, which came over this model road from the east. Those trips by sloop usually took a week.\n\nIn 1818 [[Gouverneur Kemble]] established the [[West Point Foundry]] opposite [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] to produce artillery pieces for the United States Government. The nearbys mountains contained veins of ore, and were covered with timber for fuel. A brook provided hydropower, and the Hudson a ready shipping outlet. In 1843, the Foundry built the ''USS Spencer'', the first iron ship built in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/January-2014/History-and-Preservation-of-the-West-Point-Foundry-in-Cold-Spring/ Levine, David. \"History and Preservation of the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring\", ''Hudson Valley Magazine'', December 24, 2013]</ref> With the influx of workers at the Foundry, local housing, businesses and churches increased, and Cold Spring was incorporated as a village in 1846. The first President of the Village was Joshua Haight. The Foundry became famous for its production of [[Parrott rifle]]s and other munitions during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the foundry grew to a sprawling 100-acre complex employing 1,400. It also manufactured cast iron steam engines for locomotives, gears, and produced much of the pipework for New York's water system. The rise of steel making and the declining demand for cast iron after the Civil War caused the Foundry to cease operations in 1911.<ref name=\"NysNrhpNom\">{{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/| archive-url = https://archive.today/20150701003048/http://cris.parks.ny.gov/| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2015-07-01| title = Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS)| publisher = [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]| format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2015-11-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&id=31127&q=false| title = National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: West Point Foundry| accessdate = 2015-11-01| author = Lynn Beebe Weaver| format = PDF| date = November 1972}} and [https://cris.parks.ny.gov/Uploads/ViewDoc.aspx?mode=A&id=31126&q=false ''Accompanying photographs'']</ref>\n\nMany artifacts from the Foundry's history can be viewed at the Putnam History Museum on Chestnut Street.

Mansions were built along Morris Avenue, including \"Undercliff\", the home of publisher [[George Pope Morris]], and \"Craigside\", the home of Julia and General [[Daniel Butterfield]].,<ref name=vocs/>\n\n==Churches==\nUnder the auspices of Superintendent William Young, a Presbyterian from the north of Ireland, arrangements were to conduct religious services in the pattern shop. The premises was shared by Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Baptists. The Methodists used a private home. Once every three weeks Rev. Owens from Patterson came to minister to the Presbyterians. Elder Warren from Kent cared for the religious needs of the Baptists. In the absence of an ordained minister, services were occasionally conducted by Foundry President Gouverneur Kemble. 1826 the Union Church was built. The celebrated preacher [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]] from Brooklyn is reported to have sometimes officiated there. The sacramental vessels were of pewter. By mutual agreement the Presbyterians used the building in the morning and the other religious groups in the afternoon. In 1830 the Baptists constructed a church on land donated by [[Samuel L. Gouverneur]].\n\nThe first Methodist church was built in 1833<ref name=Floyd>[https://archive.org/stream/stmaryschurchinh00floy#page/n41/mode/2up Floyd-Jones, Elbert. ''St. Mary's Church in the Highlands'', Frank B. Howard, Poughkeepsie, 1920]</ref> on the corner of Main and Church Streets. The building was sold in 1870. A new brick Italianate structure, designed by William Humphreys Jr., was built in 1868 on the north side of Main Street.<ref name=Grace/>\n\nThe Dutch Reformed Church was built around 1855 in Neoclassical style.

Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|Stereoscopic view of Church of Our Lady]]\nMany of the workers at the Foundry were Irish immigrants. As early as 1830 Father Rev. Philip O'Reilly O.P., from County Cavan, Ireland visited Cold Spring to minister to Catholics. At that time, O'Reilly was also attending congregations in Newburgh and High Falls. O'Reilly raised money to build a church and Foundry owner Gouverneur Kemble, an Episcopalian, donated the land and funds. Kemble was denounced in the local newspaper for \"abetting the idolatry of the mass\".<ref name=Burtsell>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A9I4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA454&lpg=PA454&dq=St.+Mary's,+Rondout&source=bl&ots=bknqfPLRXa&sig=IMyNTdhlJeJhTYeIE85GfC7d1yE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEAQ6AEwCWoVChMI8YrQxrSayAIVhA6SCh2oeQ9r#v=onepage&q=St.%20Mary's%2C%20Rondout&f=false Burtsell, Richard Lalor. \"The Roman Catholic Church\", Clearwater, Alphonso Trumpbour.

It was constructed in 1833 of locally made red brick covered with stucco. The Church stood twenty-five feet above the river and fifteen feet from the edge of promontory on which it was set.

Test firing from the Foundry damaged the chapel walls, and Captain [[Robert P. Parrott]], the then Foundry superintendent paid for repairs. Victorian additions altered the building's integrity, and the coming of the railroad cut it off from the rest of the village. The church was abandoned in 1906 and fell into disrepair. A fire caused further damage in 1927. In 1971 a group of interested persons, including actress [[Helen Hayes]], purchased it from the Archdiocese of New York and undertook restoration. The work was overseen by architect Walter Knight Sturges, and the chapel was dedicated as an ecumenical site in 1977.<ref>[http://www.chapelrestoration.org/history.html \"History\", Chapel Restoration]</ref>\n\nIn the 1900s Our Lady of Loretto had mission stations in Garrison and Manitou. The cornerstone of the present church was laid in 1906. The organ incorporates portions of five post-Civil War ranks of pipes believed to have been built by Levi Stuart.<ref>[http://www.glucknewyork.com/projects/opus10/opus10.html \"Church of Our Lady of Loretto\", Gluck Pipe Organs]</ref> [[The Grove (Cold Spring, New York)|The Grove]], also known as Loretto Rest, is a historic house located on Grove Court in Cold Spring, New York, United States. It was built as the estate of Frederick Lente, surgeon at the nearby West Point Foundry and later a founder of the American Academy of Medicine, in the mid-19th century. The Italian-villa design, popular at the time, was by the prominent architect Richard Upjohn. After death of Mrs. Lente in 1901 it was inherited by Patrick Connick, pastor of Our Lady of Loretto, and became a convalescent home for priests. The home was run by the Sisters of Charity. It was later converted into a convent for the Franciscan Sisters who taught at the parish school which was opened in 1913 and remained in operation until 1977. In 2008 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n===Saint Mary's in the Highlands===\nThe early Episcopal congregation was served by clergy from St. Philips in Garrison. In 1835 the Rev. Charles Lucke conducted services in Cold Spring. He was followed by Rev. Henry L. Storrs and then Rev. Edward C. Bull. In 1839 a number of English immigrants arrived to work at the Foundry. Members of the Church of England, the need for a formal Episcopal parish became apparent. Messrs Kemble and Parrott were chosen church wardens. Rev. Ebenezer Williams was the first pastor.<ref name=Floyd/>\n\nThe parish was incorporated on June 19, 1840. It is generally believed that the name of the parish was suggested by Parrott's wife Mary, who provided the funds to build the church. On June 30, Bishop [[Benjamin T. Onderdonk]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]] laid the cornerstone. That same year Rev. Williams recorded twenty-five burials, noting the prevalence of sickness in the area. The Gothic brick church, with a tower whose bell weighed 910 pounds, was completed in 1841 and consecrated in November. Besides Bishop Onderdonk, also in attendance were: Rev. John Brown of St. George's Newburgh, Rev. Moses Marcey of St. Peter's Peekskill, and Rev. Freeman Clarkson of St. Anna's of [[Beacon, New York|Fishkill Landing]].<ref name=Floyd/>\n\nA second larger church was built in 1867. Designed in the Victorian Gothic style by architect and vestry member George Edward Harney, and built under the direction of Sylvanus Ferris on land donated by Robert Parrott, it was completed the following year. It was constructed of gray granite donated by the estate of F.P. James. Situated at Main and Chestnut Streets, the church has a commanding view overlooking the village and river. The consecration of the church took place in a ceremony led by Bishop Horatio Potter on July 23, 1869. On that day the great bell in the tower, weighing 1,100 pounds, rang for the first time.<ref name=history>{{Cite web |url=http://stmaryscoldspring.org/history.html |title=\"History\", The Episcopal Church of St Mary-in-the-Highlands |access-date=2016-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219005524/http://stmaryscoldspring.org/history.html |archive-date=2016-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nInitially Sunday school classes were conducted in the basement of the church which proved too dark, damp and cold for the children. Harney and Ferris completed St. Mary's Parish Hall in 1874. The hall was the gift of Frederick and Julia James to honor the memory of their sons Frederick and Julian, who both served in the Union army during the Civil War.<ref name=history/>\n\nA fire broke out in the north transept in July 1961 causing significant damage to the church's roof and interior. The chancel roof was completely destroyed and the transept roofs were badly burned. The original organ and most of the stained glass were lost while the furniture fortunately survived with little damage. The church was restored within a year and rededicated in 1962 by Bishop Horace W. B. Donegan. Walter Jago of Sleepy Hollow Restoration, the restoration architect, donated the \"Christ Window\" above the Floyd-Jones altar in the south transept.<ref name=history/>\n\n====Rectors====\n{{columns list|colwidth=30em|\n*1839-1844 The Rev'd Father Ebenezer William \n*1844-1861 The Rev'd Father Robert Shaw \n*1861-1865 The Rev'd Father Charles W.

The valley between them has an abandoned dairy farm, two lakes, and a camp. The view from the river bank is the Constitution Marsh and the [[US Military Academy]] (West Point) slightly to the south, and Crow's Nest and [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] to the west and northwest. All of this considered, the village is nestled in the most prominent vertical terrain on the Hudson River north of New York City prior to the [[Shawangunk Ridge|Shawangunk]] and [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] ranges. Being bound by these formidable terrain features has kept the size of the village small, and prevented the suburban sprawl that has come about in the less-constrained regions to the north and south and in the New York Metropolitan area generally.

[[Hulagu Khan]], the son of [[Tolui]] and grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], inherited the [[Middle East]]ern part of the Mongol Empire after his brother [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] died in 1260. Its core territory lies in what is now part of the countries of [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Turkey]]. At its greatest extent, the Ilkhanate also included parts of modern [[Iraq]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]],  part of modern [[Dagestan]], part of modern [[Tajikistan]]. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with [[Ghazan]] in 1295, converted to [[Islam]]. In the 1330s, the Ilkhanate was ravaged by the [[Black Death]]. Its last khan [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]] died in 1335, after which the khanate disintegrated.\n\n==Definition==\nAccording to the historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], [[Kublai Khan]] granted Hulagu (H\u00fcleg\u00fc) the title of [[Ilkhan (title)|Ilkhan]] after his defeat of [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]]. The term ''ilkhan'' here means \" [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the tribe, khan of the 'ulus'\" and this inferior \"khanship\" refers to the initial deference to [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] and his successor Great Khans of the [[Mongol empire]]. The title \"Ilkhan\", borne by the descendants of Hulagu and later other Borjigin princes in Persia, does not materialize in the sources until after 1260.<ref>Peter Jackson ''The Mongols and the West'', p.127</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of the Ilkhanate}}\n===Origin===\nWhen [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm]] executed a contingent of merchants dispatched by the Mongols, [[Genghis Khan]] declared war on the [[Khw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101h dynasty]] in 1219. [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|The Mongols overran the empire]], occupying the major cities and population centers between 1219 and 1221. Iran was ravaged by the Mongol detachment under [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], who left the area in ruin. [[Transoxiana]] also came under Mongol control after the invasion.<ref>Jeremiah Curtin ''The Mongols: A history'', p.184</ref> \n\nMuhammad's son [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]] returned to Iran in c. 1224 after fleeing to India. The rival Turkic states, which were all that remained of his father's empire, quickly declared their allegiance to Jalal. He repulsed the first Mongol attempt to take Central Persia. However, Jalal ad-Din was overwhelmed and crushed by [[Chormaqan]]'s army sent by the Great Khan [[\u00d6gedei]] in 1231. During the Mongol expedition, [[Azerbaijan]] and the southern Persian dynasties in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]] voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute.<ref>Timothy May ''Chormaqan'', p.47</ref> To the west, [[Hamadan]] and the rest of Persia was secured by Chormaqan. The Mongols [[Mongol invasion of Georgia and Armenia|invaded Armenia and Georgia]] in 1234 or 1236, completing the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] in 1238. They began to attack the western parts of [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]], which was under the [[Seljuks]], the following year. By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia (including modern-day Azerbaijan), Armenia, Georgia (excluding [[Abbasid]] Iraq and [[Nizari Ismaili state|Ismaili]] strongholds), as well as all of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p.84</ref> After the [[battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f]] in 1243, the Mongols under [[Baiju]] occupied [[Anatolia]], while the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] and the [[Empire of Trebizond]] became vassals of the Mongols.<ref>George Finlay ''The history of Greece from its conquest by the Crusaders to its conquest by the Ottomans'', p.384</ref>\n\nIn 1236 \u00d6gedei commanded [[Greater Khorasan]] to be restored and the city of [[Herat]] repopulated. The Mongol military governors mostly made camp in the [[Mughan plain]] in what is now Azerbaijan. Realizing the danger posed by the Mongols, the rulers of [[Mosul]] and [[Cilician Armenia]] submitted to the Great Khan. Chormaqan divided the [[Transcaucasia]] region into three districts based on the Mongol military hierarchy.<ref>Grigor of Akanc ''The history of the nation of archers'', (tr.

Immediately after his brother M\u00f6ngke's accession as Great Khan in 1251, Hulagu was appointed as administrator of North China, however in the following year, North China was assigned to Kublai and Hulagu tasked with conquering the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He was given a fifth of the entire Mongol army for the campaign and he took his sons [[Abaqa]] and Yoshmut along with him. Hulagu also took with him many Chinese scholars and astronomers, from whom the famous Persian astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] learned about the mode of the [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese calculating tables]].<ref>H. H. Howorth ''History of the Mongols'', vol.IV, p.138</ref> An observatory was built on a hill of Maragheh. Taking over from Baiju in 1255, Hulagu established Mongol rule from Transoxiana to [[Syria]]. He destroyed the Ismaili [[Nizari]] [[Hashshashin]]s and the Abbasid Caliphate in 1256 and 1258 respectively. In 1258, Hulagu proclaimed himself Ilkhan (subordinate khan). After that he advanced as far as Gaza, briefly conquering [[Ayyubids|Ayyubid Syria]] and [[Siege of Aleppo (1260)|Aleppo]] in 1260. M\u00f6ngke's death forced Hulagu to return to Mongolia to attend the [[kuriltai]] for the next Great Khan. He left a small force of around 10,000 behind in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that was defeated at the [[battle of Ain Jalut]] by the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=225}}\n\nDue to the suspicious deaths of three [[Jochi]]d princes in Hulagu's service, [[Berke]] of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Berke\u2013Hulagu war|declared war]] on Hulagu in 1262. According to Mamluk historians, Hulagu might have massacred Berke's troops and refused to share his war booty with Berke. Berke sought a joint attack with [[Baybars]] and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde dispatched the young prince [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]] to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The Ilkhanid army then crossed the [[Terek River]], capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only to be routed in a surprise attack by Nogai's forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen Terek River.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=480}}{{sfn|Vernadsky|1953|p=161}}\n\nIn 1262, Hulagu gave [[Greater Khorasan]] and [[Mazandaran]] to Abaqa and northern [[Azerbaijan]] to Yoshmut. Hulagu himself spent his time living as a nomad in southern Azerbaijan and [[Armenia]]. During his early rule, the Ilkhanate experienced mass revolts by its subjects, with the exception of the [[Seljukids]] and [[Artuqid]]s in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mardin]]. It was not until [[Shams al-Din Juvayni]] was appointed as vizier after 1262 that things started calming down and a more sustainable administration was implemented.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=226}}\n\nHulagu fell ill in February 1265 after several days of banquets and hunting. He died on 8 February and his son Abaqa succeeded him in the summer.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=226}}\n\n===Middle period (1265\u20131291)===\nUpon [[Abaqa]]'s accession, he immediately faced an invasion by [[Berke]] of the Golden Horde, which ended with Berke's death in [[Tiflis]]. In 1270, Abaqa defeated an invasion by [[Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq]] of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. Abaqa's brother [[Tekuder]] sacked [[Bukhara]] in retaliation. In 1277, the [[Mamluks]] invaded Anatolia and defeated the Mongols at the [[Battle of Elbistan]]. Stung by the defeat, Abaqa executed the local regent Mu'in-ad-Din Pervane and replaced him with the Mongol prince Qongqortai. In 1281, Abaqa sent Mongke Temur against the Mamluks, but he too was defeated at [[Second Battle of Homs|Homs]].{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\nAbaqa's death in 1282 triggered a succession struggle between his son [[Arghun]], supported by the [[Qara'unas]], and his brother Tekuder, supported by the Chinggisid aristocracy. Tekuder was elected khan by the Chinggisids. Tekuder was the first [[Muslim]] ruler of the Ilkhanate but he made no active attempt to proselytize or convert his realm. However he did try to replace Mongol political traditions with Islamic ones, resulting in a loss of support from the army. Arghun used his religion against him by appealing to non-Muslims for support. When Tekuder realized this, he executed several of Arghun's supporters, and captured Arghun. Tekuder's foster son, Buaq, freed Arghun and overthrew Tekuder. Arghun was confirmed as Ilkhan by [[Kublai Khan]] in February 1286.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\nDuring Arghun's reign, he actively sought to combat Muslim influence, and fought against both the Mamluks and the Muslim Mongol emir [[Nawr\u016bz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]] in Khorasan. To fund his campaigns, Arghun allowed his viziers Buqa and Sa'd-ud-dawla to centralize expenditures, but this was highly unpopular and caused his former supporters to turn against him. Both viziers were killed and Arghun was murdered in 1291.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\n===Religious shift (1291\u20131316)===\n[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ruler, [[Ghazan]], studying the [[Qur'an]].]]\nThe Ilkhanate started crumbling under the reign of Arghun's brother, [[Gaykhatu]]. The majority of Mongols converted to Islam while the Mongol court remained [[Buddhist]]. Gaykhatu had to buy the support of his followers and as a result, ruined the realm's finances. His vizir Sadr-ud-Din Zanjani tried to bolster the state finances by adopting paper money from the [[Yuan dynasty]], which ended horribly. Gaykhatu also alienated the Mongol old guard with his alleged sexual relations with a boy. Gaykhatu was overthrown in 1295 and replaced with his cousin [[Baydu]]. Baydu reigned for less than a year before he was overthrown by Gaykhatu's son, [[Ghazan]].{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\nHulagu's descendants ruled Persia for the next eighty years, tolerating multiple religions, including Shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity, and ultimately adopting Islam as a state religion in 1295. However, despite this conversion, the Ilkhans remained opposed to the Mamluks, who had defeated both Mongol invaders and [[Crusaders]]. The Ilkhans launched several invasions of Syria, but were never able to gain and keep significant ground against the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], eventually being forced to give up their plans to conquer Syria, along with their stranglehold over their vassals the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian kingdom in Cilicia]]. This was in large part due to civil war in the Mongol Empire and the hostility of the khanates to the north and east. The [[Chagatai Khanate]] in [[Moghulistan]] and the [[Golden Horde]] threatened the Ilkhanate in the [[Caucasus]] and Transoxiana, preventing expansion westward.  Even under Hulagu's reign, the Ilkhanate was engaged in open warfare in the Caucasus with the Mongols in the Russian steppes. On the other hand, the China-based [[Yuan Dynasty]] was an ally of the Ikhanate and also held nominal suzerainty over the latter (the Emperor being also Great Khan) for many decades.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood ''Ibid''</ref>\n\nGhazan converted to Islam under influence of [[Nawr\u016bz (Mongol emir)|Nawr\u016bz]] and made Islam the official state religion. Christian and Jewish subjects lost their equal status and had to pay the ''[[jizya]]'' protection tax. Ghazan gave Buddhists the starker choice of conversion or expulsion and ordered their temples to be destroyed; though he later relaxed this severity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubgBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA72|title=Medieval Persia 1040\u20131797|author=David Morgan |page=72|isbn=9781317415671|date=2015-06-26|author-link=David Morgan (historian)}}</ref> After Nawr\u016bz was  deposed and killed in 1297, Ghazan made religious intolerance punishable and attempted to restore relations with non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gB9DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|publisher= ABC-CLIO|title=The Mongol Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia - Volume I|author=Timothy May|year=2016|page=141|isbn= 9781610693400}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlgRqLA0EHsC&pg=PA182&dq=oljeitu+buddhists#v=onepage&f=false|title=The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks: War and Diplomacy During the Reigns of Het'um II (1289-1307)|author=Angus Donal Stewart|publisher=Brill|page=182|isbn=978-9004122925|date=2001-01-01}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of foreign relations, the Ilkhanate's conversion to Islam had little to no effect on its hostility towards other Muslim states, and conflict with the Mamluks for control of Syria continued. The [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]], the only major victory by the Mongols over the Mamluks, ended the latter's control over Syria for a few months.

He was faced with rebellion in 1318 by the Chagatayids and Qara'unas in Khorasan, and an invasion by the Golden Horde at the same time. An Anatolian emir, Irenchin, also rebelled. Irenchin was crushed by [[Chupan]] of the [[Taichiud]] in the Battle of Zanjan-Rud on 13 July, 1319. Under the influence of Chupan, the Ilkhanate made peace with the Chagatais, who helped them crush the Chagatayid revolt, and the Mamluks. In 1327, Abu-Sai'd replaced Chupan with \"Big\" Hasan.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=235}} Hasan was accused of attempting to assassinate the khan and exiled to Anatolia in 1332. The non-Mongol emirs Sharaf-ud-Din Mahmud-Shah and Ghiyas-ud-Din Muhammad were given unprecedented military authority, which irked the Mongol emirs. In the 1330s, outbreaks of the [[Black Death]] ravaged the Ilkhanate and both Abu-Sai'd and his sons were killed by 1335 by the plague.<ref>Continuity and Change in Medieval Persia By Ann K. S.

In 1357, [[Jani Beg]] of the Golden Horde conquered Chupanid-held Tabriz for a year, putting an end to the Ilkhanate remnant.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=236}}\n\n==Franco-Mongol alliance==\n{{main|Franco-Mongol alliance}}\nThe courts of [[Western Europe]] made many attempts to form an alliance with the Mongols, primarily with the Ilkhanate, in the 13th and 14th centuries, starting from around the time of the [[Seventh Crusade]] (West Europeans were collectively called Franks by Muslims and Asians in the era of the Crusades). United in their opposition to the [[Muslim]]s (primarily the Mamluks), the Ilkhanate and the Europeans were nevertheless unable to satisfactorily combine their forces against their common enemy.<ref>\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam\". Atwood, ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire'', p. 583, \"Western Europe and the Mongol Empire\"</ref>\n\n==Government==\nThe Ilkhanate Mongols remained nomadic in their way of life until the end of the dynasty. Their nomadic routes covered central [[Iraq]], northwest [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenia]]. The Mongols administered Iraq, the [[Caucasus]], and western and southern Iran directly with the exception of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Artuqid]] sultan of [[Mardin]], and [[Kufa]] and [[Luristan]]. The [[Qara'unas]] Mongols ruled [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] as an autonomous realm and did not pay taxes. [[Herat]]'s local [[Kart dynasty]] also remained autonomous. Anatolia was the richest province of the Ilkhanate, supplying a quarter of its revenue while Iraq and [[Diyarbakir]] together supplied about 35 percent of its revenue.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=231}}\n\nIn 1330, the annexation of [[Abkhazia]] resulted in the reunification of the Kingdom of Georgia. However, tribute received by the Il-Khans from Georgia sank by about three-quarters between 1336 and 1350 because of wars and famines.<ref>D. M.

The establishment of the unified Mongol Empire had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia. The communications between the Ilkhanate and the [[Yuan Dynasty]] headquartered in China encouraged this development.<ref>Gregory G.Guzman - Were the barbarians a negative or positive factor in ancient and medieval history?, The historian 50 (1988), 568-70</ref><ref>Thomas T.Allsen - Culture and conquest in Mongol Eurasia, 211</ref> The dragon clothing of Imperial China was used by the Ilkhanids, the Chinese Huangdi (Emperor) title was used by the Ilkhanids due to heavy clout upon the Mongols of the Chinese system of politics.

Harrassowitz|page=46}}</ref>\n\nThe Ilkhanate also helped to pave the way for the later [[Safavid]] dynastic state, and ultimately the modern country of Iran. Hulagu's conquests had also opened Iran to Chinese influence from the east. This, combined with patronage from his successors, would develop Iran's distinctive excellence in architecture. Under the Ilkhans, Iranian historians also moved from writing in Arabic to writing in their native Persian tongue.<ref>Francis Robinson, The Mughal Emperors and the Islamic Dynasties of India, Iran and Central Asia, Pages 19 and 36</ref>\n\nThe rudiments of [[double-entry accounting]] were practiced in the Ilkhanate; [[merdiban]] was then adopted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. These developments were independent from the accounting practices used in Europe.<ref>Cigdem Solas, ACCOUNTING SYSTEM PRACTICED IN THE NEAR EAST DURING THE PERIOD 1220-1350, based ON THE BOOK RISALE-I FELEKIYYE, ''The Accounting Historians Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 117-135</ref> This accounting system was adopted primarily as the result of socio-economic necessities created by the agricultural and fiscal reforms of Ghazan Khan in 1295-1304.\n\n===Ilkhan as a tribal title in 19th/20th century Iran===\nThe title Ilkhan resurfaced among the [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] nomads of Southern Iran in the 19th century.

The last Ilkhan was [[Naser Khan]], who in 1954 was pushed into exile after his support of [[Mossadeq]].

[[Hulagu Khan]], the son of [[Tolui]] and grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], inherited the [[Middle East]]ern part of the Mongol Empire after his brother [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] died in 1260. Its core territory lies in what is now part of the countries of [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Turkey]]. At its greatest extent, the Ilkhanate also included parts of modern [[Iraq]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]],  part of modern [[Dagestan]], part of modern [[Tajikistan]]. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with [[Ghazan]] in 1295, converted to [[Islam]]. In the 1330s, the Ilkhanate was ravaged by the [[Black Death]].

[[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|The Mongols overran the empire]], occupying the major cities and population centers between 1219 and 1221.

The rival Turkic states, which were all that remained of his father's empire, quickly declared their allegiance to Jalal. He repulsed the first Mongol attempt to take Central Persia. However, Jalal ad-Din was overwhelmed and crushed by [[Chormaqan]]'s army sent by the Great Khan [[\u00d6gedei]] in 1231. During the Mongol expedition, [[Azerbaijan]] and the southern Persian dynasties in [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]] voluntarily submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute.<ref>Timothy May ''Chormaqan'', p.47</ref> To the west, [[Hamadan]] and the rest of Persia was secured by Chormaqan.

They began to attack the western parts of [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]], which was under the [[Seljuks]], the following year. By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia (including modern-day Azerbaijan), Armenia, Georgia (excluding [[Abbasid]] Iraq and [[Nizari Ismaili state|Ismaili]] strongholds), as well as all of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kashmir]].<ref>[[Thomas T.

Immediately after his brother M\u00f6ngke's accession as Great Khan in 1251, Hulagu was appointed as administrator of North China, however in the following year, North China was assigned to Kublai and Hulagu tasked with conquering the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. He was given a fifth of the entire Mongol army for the campaign and he took his sons [[Abaqa]] and Yoshmut along with him. Hulagu also took with him many Chinese scholars and astronomers, from whom the famous Persian astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] learned about the mode of the [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese calculating tables]].<ref>H. H. Howorth ''History of the Mongols'', vol.IV, p.138</ref> An observatory was built on a hill of Maragheh. Taking over from Baiju in 1255, Hulagu established Mongol rule from Transoxiana to [[Syria]]. He destroyed the Ismaili [[Nizari]] [[Hashshashin]]s and the Abbasid Caliphate in 1256 and 1258 respectively. In 1258, Hulagu proclaimed himself Ilkhan (subordinate khan). After that he advanced as far as Gaza, briefly conquering [[Ayyubids|Ayyubid Syria]] and [[Siege of Aleppo (1260)|Aleppo]] in 1260. M\u00f6ngke's death forced Hulagu to return to Mongolia to attend the [[kuriltai]] for the next Great Khan. He left a small force of around 10,000 behind in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that was defeated at the [[battle of Ain Jalut]] by the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]].{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=225}}\n\nDue to the suspicious deaths of three [[Jochi]]d princes in Hulagu's service, [[Berke]] of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Berke\u2013Hulagu war|declared war]] on Hulagu in 1262. According to Mamluk historians, Hulagu might have massacred Berke's troops and refused to share his war booty with Berke. Berke sought a joint attack with [[Baybars]] and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde dispatched the young prince [[Nogai Khan|Nogai]] to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The Ilkhanid army then crossed the [[Terek River]], capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only to be routed in a surprise attack by Nogai's forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen Terek River.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=480}}{{sfn|Vernadsky|1953|p=161}}\n\nIn 1262, Hulagu gave [[Greater Khorasan]] and [[Mazandaran]] to Abaqa and northern [[Azerbaijan]] to Yoshmut. Hulagu himself spent his time living as a nomad in southern Azerbaijan and [[Armenia]]. During his early rule, the Ilkhanate experienced mass revolts by its subjects, with the exception of the [[Seljukids]] and [[Artuqid]]s in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mardin]]. It was not until [[Shams al-Din Juvayni]] was appointed as vizier after 1262 that things started calming down and a more sustainable administration was implemented.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=226}}\n\nHulagu fell ill in February 1265 after several days of banquets and hunting. He died on 8 February and his son Abaqa succeeded him in the summer.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=226}}\n\n===Middle period (1265\u20131291)===\nUpon [[Abaqa]]'s accession, he immediately faced an invasion by [[Berke]] of the Golden Horde, which ended with Berke's death in [[Tiflis]]. In 1270, Abaqa defeated an invasion by [[Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq]] of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. Abaqa's brother [[Tekuder]] sacked [[Bukhara]] in retaliation. In 1277, the [[Mamluks]] invaded Anatolia and defeated the Mongols at the [[Battle of Elbistan]]. Stung by the defeat, Abaqa executed the local regent Mu'in-ad-Din Pervane and replaced him with the Mongol prince Qongqortai. In 1281, Abaqa sent Mongke Temur against the Mamluks, but he too was defeated at [[Second Battle of Homs|Homs]].{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\nAbaqa's death in 1282 triggered a succession struggle between his son [[Arghun]], supported by the [[Qara'unas]], and his brother Tekuder, supported by the Chinggisid aristocracy. Tekuder was elected khan by the Chinggisids. Tekuder was the first [[Muslim]] ruler of the Ilkhanate but he made no active attempt to proselytize or convert his realm. However he did try to replace Mongol political traditions with Islamic ones, resulting in a loss of support from the army. Arghun used his religion against him by appealing to non-Muslims for support. When Tekuder realized this, he executed several of Arghun's supporters, and captured Arghun. Tekuder's foster son, Buaq, freed Arghun and overthrew Tekuder. Arghun was confirmed as Ilkhan by [[Kublai Khan]] in February 1286.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\nDuring Arghun's reign, he actively sought to combat Muslim influence, and fought against both the Mamluks and the Muslim Mongol emir [[Nawr\u016bz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]] in Khorasan. To fund his campaigns, Arghun allowed his viziers Buqa and Sa'd-ud-dawla to centralize expenditures, but this was highly unpopular and caused his former supporters to turn against him. Both viziers were killed and Arghun was murdered in 1291.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\n===Religious shift (1291\u20131316)===\n[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ruler, [[Ghazan]], studying the [[Qur'an]].]]\nThe Ilkhanate started crumbling under the reign of Arghun's brother, [[Gaykhatu]]. The majority of Mongols converted to Islam while the Mongol court remained [[Buddhist]]. Gaykhatu had to buy the support of his followers and as a result, ruined the realm's finances. His vizir Sadr-ud-Din Zanjani tried to bolster the state finances by adopting paper money from the [[Yuan dynasty]], which ended horribly. Gaykhatu also alienated the Mongol old guard with his alleged sexual relations with a boy. Gaykhatu was overthrown in 1295 and replaced with his cousin [[Baydu]]. Baydu reigned for less than a year before he was overthrown by Gaykhatu's son, [[Ghazan]].{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=234}}\n\nHulagu's descendants ruled Persia for the next eighty years, tolerating multiple religions, including Shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity, and ultimately adopting Islam as a state religion in 1295. However, despite this conversion, the Ilkhans remained opposed to the Mamluks, who had defeated both Mongol invaders and [[Crusaders]]. The Ilkhans launched several invasions of Syria, but were never able to gain and keep significant ground against the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], eventually being forced to give up their plans to conquer Syria, along with their stranglehold over their vassals the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian kingdom in Cilicia]]. This was in large part due to civil war in the Mongol Empire and the hostility of the khanates to the north and east. The [[Chagatai Khanate]] in [[Moghulistan]] and the [[Golden Horde]] threatened the Ilkhanate in the [[Caucasus]] and Transoxiana, preventing expansion westward.  Even under Hulagu's reign, the Ilkhanate was engaged in open warfare in the Caucasus with the Mongols in the Russian steppes. On the other hand, the China-based [[Yuan Dynasty]] was an ally of the Ikhanate and also held nominal suzerainty over the latter (the Emperor being also Great Khan) for many decades.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood ''Ibid''</ref>\n\nGhazan converted to Islam under influence of [[Nawr\u016bz (Mongol emir)|Nawr\u016bz]] and made Islam the official state religion. Christian and Jewish subjects lost their equal status and had to pay the ''[[jizya]]'' protection tax. Ghazan gave Buddhists the starker choice of conversion or expulsion and ordered their temples to be destroyed; though he later relaxed this severity.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubgBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA72|title=Medieval Persia 1040\u20131797|author=David Morgan |page=72|isbn=9781317415671|date=2015-06-26|author-link=David Morgan (historian)}}</ref> After Nawr\u016bz was  deposed and killed in 1297, Ghazan made religious intolerance punishable and attempted to restore relations with non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gB9DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|publisher= ABC-CLIO|title=The Mongol Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia - Volume I|author=Timothy May|year=2016|page=141|isbn= 9781610693400}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlgRqLA0EHsC&pg=PA182&dq=oljeitu+buddhists#v=onepage&f=false|title=The Armenian Kingdom and the Mamluks: War and Diplomacy During the Reigns of Het'um II (1289-1307)|author=Angus Donal Stewart|publisher=Brill|page=182|isbn=978-9004122925|date=2001-01-01}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of foreign relations, the Ilkhanate's conversion to Islam had little to no effect on its hostility towards other Muslim states, and conflict with the Mamluks for control of Syria continued. The [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]], the only major victory by the Mongols over the Mamluks, ended the latter's control over Syria for a few months. For the most part, Ghazan's policies continued under his brother [[\u00d6ljeit\u00fc]] despite suggestions that he might begin to favor the [[Shi'a]] brand of Islam after he came under the influence of Shi'a theologians [[Al-Hilli]] and [[Maitham Al Bahrani]].<ref>Ali Al Oraibi, \"Rationalism in the school of Bahrain: a historical perspective\", in ''Sh\u012b\u02bbite Heritage: Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions'' by Lynda Clarke, Global Academic Publishing 2001 p336</ref>\n\n\u00d6ljeit\u00fc, who had been [[baptism|baptised]] in Christianity as an infant, had flirted with Buddhism, became a [[Hanafi|Hanafi Sunni]], though he still retained some residual shamanism.

The process of establishment of Islam did not happen suddenly. \u00d6ljeit\u00fc's historian Q\u0101sh\u0101ni records that [[Qutlugh-Shah]], after losing patience with a dispute between [[Hanafi]]s and [[Shafi'i]]s, expressed his view that Islam should be abandoned and Mongols should return to the ways of Genghis Khan. Q\u0101shani also stated that \u00d6ljeit\u00fc had in fact reverted for a brief period.

He was faced with rebellion in 1318 by the Chagatayids and Qara'unas in Khorasan, and an invasion by the Golden Horde at the same time. An Anatolian emir, Irenchin, also rebelled. Irenchin was crushed by [[Chupan]] of the [[Taichiud]] in the Battle of Zanjan-Rud on 13 July, 1319. Under the influence of Chupan, the Ilkhanate made peace with the Chagatais, who helped them crush the Chagatayid revolt, and the Mamluks. In 1327, Abu-Sai'd replaced Chupan with \"Big\" Hasan.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=235}} Hasan was accused of attempting to assassinate the khan and exiled to Anatolia in 1332. The non-Mongol emirs Sharaf-ud-Din Mahmud-Shah and Ghiyas-ud-Din Muhammad were given unprecedented military authority, which irked the Mongol emirs. In the 1330s, outbreaks of the [[Black Death]] ravaged the Ilkhanate and both Abu-Sai'd and his sons were killed by 1335 by the plague.<ref>Continuity and Change in Medieval Persia By Ann K. S. Lambton</ref> Ghiyas-ud-Din put a descendant of [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]], [[Arpa Ke'un]], on the throne, triggering a succession of short-lived khans until \"Little\" Hasan took Azerbaijan in 1338. In 1357, [[Jani Beg]] of the Golden Horde conquered Chupanid-held Tabriz for a year, putting an end to the Ilkhanate remnant.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=236}}\n\n==Franco-Mongol alliance==\n{{main|Franco-Mongol alliance}}\nThe courts of [[Western Europe]] made many attempts to form an alliance with the Mongols, primarily with the Ilkhanate, in the 13th and 14th centuries, starting from around the time of the [[Seventh Crusade]] (West Europeans were collectively called Franks by Muslims and Asians in the era of the Crusades). United in their opposition to the [[Muslim]]s (primarily the Mamluks), the Ilkhanate and the Europeans were nevertheless unable to satisfactorily combine their forces against their common enemy.<ref>\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam\". Atwood, ''Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire'', p. 583, \"Western Europe and the Mongol Empire\"</ref>\n\n==Government==\nThe Ilkhanate Mongols remained nomadic in their way of life until the end of the dynasty. Their nomadic routes covered central [[Iraq]], northwest [[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenia]]. The Mongols administered Iraq, the [[Caucasus]], and western and southern Iran directly with the exception of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the [[Artuqid]] sultan of [[Mardin]], and [[Kufa]] and [[Luristan]]. The [[Qara'unas]] Mongols ruled [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] as an autonomous realm and did not pay taxes. [[Herat]]'s local [[Kart dynasty]] also remained autonomous. Anatolia was the richest province of the Ilkhanate, supplying a quarter of its revenue while Iraq and [[Diyarbakir]] together supplied about 35 percent of its revenue.{{sfn|Atwood|2004|p=231}}\n\nIn 1330, the annexation of [[Abkhazia]] resulted in the reunification of the Kingdom of Georgia. However, tribute received by the Il-Khans from Georgia sank by about three-quarters between 1336 and 1350 because of wars and famines.<ref>D. M.

Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 17, No. 1 (1955), pp. 74-91</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe emergence of the Ilkhanate had an important historical impact in the Middle Eastern region. The establishment of the unified Mongol Empire had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia. The communications between the Ilkhanate and the [[Yuan Dynasty]] headquartered in China encouraged this development.<ref>Gregory G.Guzman - Were the barbarians a negative or positive factor in ancient and medieval history?, The historian 50 (1988), 568-70</ref><ref>Thomas T.Allsen - Culture and conquest in Mongol Eurasia, 211</ref> The dragon clothing of Imperial China was used by the Ilkhanids, the Chinese Huangdi (Emperor) title was used by the Ilkhanids due to heavy clout upon the Mongols of the Chinese system of politics.

Harrassowitz|page=46}}</ref>\n\nThe Ilkhanate also helped to pave the way for the later [[Safavid]] dynastic state, and ultimately the modern country of Iran. Hulagu's conquests had also opened Iran to Chinese influence from the east. This, combined with patronage from his successors, would develop Iran's distinctive excellence in architecture. Under the Ilkhans, Iranian historians also moved from writing in Arabic to writing in their native Persian tongue.<ref>Francis Robinson, The Mughal Emperors and the Islamic Dynasties of India, Iran and Central Asia, Pages 19 and 36</ref>\n\nThe rudiments of [[double-entry accounting]] were practiced in the Ilkhanate; [[merdiban]] was then adopted by the [[Ottoman Empire]].
