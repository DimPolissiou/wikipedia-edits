They farmed [[cassava]], peanuts, tobacco, [[sweet potato]]es and maize, in addition to extracting the essence from other local plants such as the [[Caryocar brasiliense|pequi]] and the [[Attalea speciosa|babassu]]. Production was for food, [[straw]] or [[madeira]].  They cultivated local fruits such as [[jabuticaba]], [[cashew]]s, [[Spondias mombin]] and [[Goiaba]]s.\n\nThe Indians both influenced and were influenced by the Europeans who arrived in the fifteenth century. The Portuguese \"nourished themselves with wood-flour, slaughtered the big game to eat, packed their nets and imitated the rough, free life\" in the words of Pedro Calmon.<ref>CALMON, Pedro: ''Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil'', S\u00e3o Paulo, 1939, vol. 1</ref>\n\nUntil other crops began to be exported, [[brazilwood]] was the main reason Portugal wanted control in Brazil.<ref>{{cite book | last = ARRUDA | first = Jos\u00e9 Jobson  | title = Hist\u00f3ria Integrada: da Idade M\u00e9dia ao nascimento do mundo moderno  | edition = 2\u00aa | year = 1996 | publisher = [[editora \u00c1tica|\u00c1tica]] | place = S\u00e3o Paulo | isbn = 85-08-05399-1 | pages = 126, 129  | chapter = Cap. 21 \u2013 ''Os primeiros tempos: a explora\u00e7\u00e3o do pau-brasil'' | quote = Foi com o objetivo de explorar o com\u00e9rcio dessa madeira que os portugueses fundaram uma s\u00e9rie de benfeitorias(...)

This provided arable land and ashes for use as fertilizer and soil cover.\n\nScholars such as [[Monteiro Lobato]] considered this practice to be harmful. However, burning only became a problem when the Europeans adopted the practice aggressively around 1500, divided land into farms, began monocropping, etc. The combination of burning with these new farming methods decimated native flora.<ref name=aa>{{cite journal |title=O uso do fogo: o manejo ind\u00edgena e a piromania da monocultura |volume=14 |issue=40 |pages=231\u2013250 |language=pt |author=Leonel, Mauro |journal=Estudos Avan\u00e7ados |date=Sep\u2013Dec 2000 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1590/S0103-40142000000300019 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIndian land management included garden areas in locations selected to allow interaction with their surroundings. Indians conserved the environment in exchange for hunting the animals and protecting themselves against pests.

Brazilian sugar was thirty percent less expensive than sugar from elsewhere, creating major export opportunities.\n\nA decline in the second half of the 17th century led many producer regions to diversify production, expanding cotton or, in [[Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos|Reconcavo Baiano]], tobacco or cocoa. The archaic social structure and obsolete technology outlasted cane production in those regions.<ref name=bb/>\n\n==== Slave labor ====\n{{Main|Slavery in Brazil}}[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mariano da Conceicao Velloso - O fazendeiro do Brazil - cultivador.jpg|thumb|In the illustration of \"O Fazendeiro do Brasil\" (The Farmer in Brazil), 1806, [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Veloso]] describes the steps and tools used in the cultivation of indigo in Brazil.]]\n\nInitially, plantation owners attempted to use local labor in their fields. While laws prohibited their enslavement, in many areas the law was not respected. Locals responded by rebelling, flight or simply dying. European diseases took a heavy toll on indigenous peoples.\n\nThe settlers then switched to enslaving and importing Africans to do the work.<ref name=\"hh\">SILVA, Joaquim, PENNA, J. B. Damasco: ''Hist\u00f3ria Geral'', Cia. Editora Nacional, S\u00e3o Paulo, 1972</ref> The Portuguese and others imported 4 million Africans to carry out cultivation, using what came to be called the [[plantation economy|plantation system]].\n\nIn the first century, after European arrival the slave population had already surpassed that of the locals, decimated by disease. Antonil stated: \"the slaves are the hands and feet of the mill, because without them in Brazil, it is not possible to make, maintain or expand the farm or have a running mill.\"<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nThe slaves cleared the agricultural frontiers, such as in the west for coffee [[plantation]]s. By the end of the Second Reign, Brazil accounted for more than half the world's coffee production.<ref name=\"hh\" />\n\nOn 13 May 1888 Brazil adopted the [[Lei \u00c1urea]] ('Golden Law'), which abolished slavery in Brazil. In the preceding years, 75% of the Africans and mulattoes had been freed by [[manumission]].<ref name=\"Bergad\">Bergad, Laird W. 2007.

Many of the farmers turned to the Republican party or became indifferent to the attack of the institutions...\"\n\nThe law did not provide an accompanying land distribution to the ex-captives. It led to a [[rural exodus]], both from the workers and from the now-bankrupt landlords.

It hastened immigration following the end of slavery. The era reached its peak with [[Caf\u00e9 com leite politics]], ending with the [[Manuel Ferraz de Campos Sales|Campos Sales]] administration. The [[Great Depression]] closed this cycle at the end of the 1930s with industrialization, capitalized by profits from coffee production.<ref>ARRUDA, Jos\u00e9 Jobson de A.: ''Hist\u00f3ria Moderna e Contempor\u00e2nea''. \u00c1tica, S\u00e3o Paulo, 13th ed., 1981.</ref>\n\n[[File:Preparing for coffee shipment.jpg|thumb|Bagging for export, at the height of the coffee cycle.]]\n\nCoffee drew many Italian immigrants to the west of S\u00e3o Paulo.

Royalist invasion forces were defeated at [[Siege of Toulon|Toulon]] in 1793, leaving the French republican forces in an offensive position and granting nationwide fame to a young hero, [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] (1769\u20131821). Following their victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]], the French occupied Belgium and the Rhineland. An invasion of the Netherlands established the puppet [[Batavian Republic]]. Finally, a peace agreement was concluded between France, Spain, and Prussia in 1795 at [[Peace of Basel|Basel]].<ref>Geoffrey Bruun, ''Europe and the French Imperium, 1799\u20131814 '' (1938) [https://archive.org/download/in.ernet.dli.2015.183653/2015.183653.Europe-And-The-French-Imperium-1799-1814_text.pdf online].</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\n{{main|Napoleonic Wars}}\nBy 1799 Napoleon had seized power in France and proved highly adept at warfare and coalition building. Britain led a series of shifting coalitions to oppose him.  After a brief truce in 1802\u20133, war resumed. In 1806 Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]]. Napoleon was not alone since he now had a complex network of allies and subject states.  The largely outnumbered French army crushed the Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806; Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the [[Battle of Friedland]] (14 June 1807). Peace was dictated in the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], in which Russia had to join the [[Continental System]], and Prussia handed half of its territories to France. The [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was formed over these territorial losses, and Polish troops entered the Grande Arm\u00e9e in significant numbers.<ref>Steven T.

Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, was made King of Spain after [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] abdicated. This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese fought the French using [[guerrilla tactics]], defeating the French forces at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] (June and July 1808). Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the [[Convention of Sintra]] following the Allied victory at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]] (21 August 1808). France only controlled [[Catalonia]] and [[Navarre]] and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not.<ref>Charles J. Esdaile, ''Fighting Napoleon: Guerrillas, Bandits & Adventurers in Spain, 1808\u20131814'' (2004).</ref>\n\nAnother French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as \"an avalanche of fire and steel.\" However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth Coalition]] in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], yet was beaten at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]] while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at [[Battle of Raszyn (1809)|Raszyn]] (April 1809). Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|peace treaty]] in October 1809 stripped Austria of a large amount of territories, reducing it even more.\n\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|250px|Napoleon Bonaparte retreating from Moscow, by [[Adolf Northern]].]]\n\nIn 1812 Napoleon could no longer tolerate Russian independence. He assembled a gigantic army and invaded. The [[French invasion of Russia (1812)]] Was a total disaster, caused primarily by weather, partisan attacks, disease and inadequate logistics.  Only small remnants of the invading army returned from Russia. On the Spanish front the French armies were defeated and evacuated Spain.<ref>Michael Adams, ''Napoleon and Russia'' (2006)</ref>\n\nSince France had been defeated on these two fronts, states it previously conquered and controlled struck back. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] was formed, and the German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] outside Leipzig in October 1813. The Allies invaded France and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814. The [[Conservative Order|conservative]] [[Congress of Vienna]] reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon's attempted restoration, a period known as the [[Hundred Days]], ended with his final defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.  The monarchy was restored with [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] as king, followed by his brother.  France was soon integrated into the reactionary international situation.

The Bourbons were restored, but left a weak record and one branch was overthrown in 1830 and the other branch in 1848 as Napoleon's nephew was elected president. He made himself emperor as [[Napoleon III]] and lasted until he was defeated and captured by Prussians in 1870 a war that humiliated France and made the new nation of Germany dominant in the continent. France built up an empire, especially in Africa and Indochina. The economy was strong, with a good railway system.

Religious and class differences deeply divided the French people on polarities such as monarchy versus Republicanism, secularism versus Catholicism, farmers versus urbanites, workers versus owners. Permanent professional diplomats and bureaucrats had developed their own  traditions of how to operate  at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (where the Foreign Ministry was located), and their style  changed little from generation to generation.  Most of the diplomats came from high status or aristocratic families.  Although France was one of the few republics in Europe, its diplomats mingled smoothly with the aristocratic representatives at the royal courts.  Prime ministers and leading politicians generally paid little attention to foreign affairs, allowing a handful of senior men to control policy.  In the decades before the First World War they dominated the embassies in the 10 major countries were France had an ambassador (elsewhere, they set lower-ranking ministers).  They included [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the foreign minister from 1898 to 1906; [[Paul Cambon]],  the ambassador in London, 1890\u20131920; [[Jean Jules Jusserand]] in Washington from 1902 to 1924; and Camille Barrere, in Rome from 1897 to 1924.  In terms of foreign policy, there was general agreement about the need for high protective tariffs, which kept agricultural prices high.  After the defeat by the Germans, there was a strong widespread anti-German sentiment focused on revanchism and regaining Alsace and Lorraine.  The Empire was a matter of great pride, and service as administrators, soldiers and missionaries was a high status, occupation.<ref>Felix Gilbert, David Clay Large, ''The End of the European Era: 1890 to the Present'' (2002) p 64\u201365.</ref><ref>J.

The Republicans at first seemed highly unlikely to welcome any military alliance with Russia. That large nation was poor and not industrialized; it was intensely religious and authoritarian, with no sense of democracy or freedom for its peoples.  It oppressed Poland, and exiled, and even executed political liberals and radicals. At a time when French Republicans were rallying in the [[Dreyfus affair]] against anti-Semitism, Russia was the most notorious center in the world of anti-Semitic outrages, including multiple murderous large-scale pogroms against the Jews. On the other hand, France was increasingly frustrated by Bismarck's success in isolating it diplomatically. France had issues with Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance. Paris made a few overtures to Berlin, but they were rebuffed, and after 1900 there was a threat of war between France and Germany over Germany's attempt to deny French expansion into Morocco. Great Britain was still in its \"splendid isolation\" mode and after a major agreement in 1890 with Germany, it seemed especially favorable toward Berlin. Colonial conflicts in Africa brought Britain and France to a major crisis The Fashoda crisis of 1898 brought Britain and France almost to the brink of war and ended with a humiliation of France that left it hostile to Britain. By 1892 Russia was the only opportunity for France to break out of its diplomatic isolation. Russia had been allied with Germany the new Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890 and in 1892 ended the \"Reinsurance treaty\" with Russia. Russia was now alone diplomatically and like France, it needed a military alliance to contain the threat of Germany's strong army and military aggressiveness. The pope, angered by German anti-Catholicism, worked diplomatically to bring Paris and St. Petersburg together. Russia desperately needed money for our infrastructure of railways and ports facilities. The German government refused to allow its banks to lend money to Russia, but French banks eagerly did so. For example, it funded the essential trans-Siberian railway. Negotiations were increasingly successful, and by 1895. France and Russia had signed the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], a strong military alliance to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them.  France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation.<ref>John B.  Wolf, ''France 1814\u20131919: The rise of a Liberal-Democratic Society'' (1963)</ref><ref>William L.

The plan seemed to promise quick victory but it failed because of inadequate forces, unexpected Belgian resistance, and poor coordination among German generals. France had already launched its invasion of Germany with [[Plan XVII]], but very quickly realized it needed to defend Paris at all costs. It did so at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] {{nowrap|(5\u201312 September),}}; the German armies were defeated and forced back.  The war became stalemated on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], with practically no movement until spring 1918. Both sides suffered very high casualties caused by repeated infantry attacks against defensive positions protected by trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, and heavy artillery using aircraft as spotters, and poison gas.  Meanwhile, the rich industrial and mining regions of Belgium and northeastern France remained in German hands throughout the war.  Marshals [[Joseph Joffre]] (1852\u20131931) and [[Douglas Haig]] (1861\u20131928) believed that attrition would win the war by wearing down the German reserves in multiple massive assaults. German general [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] (1861\u20131922) was outnumbered and focused on defense.

Inflation heavily damaged the German middle class (Whose bank accounts became worthless) but it also damaged the French franc. France fomented a separatist movement pointing to an independent buffer state, but it collapsed after some bloodshed.  The intervention was a failure, and in summer 1924 France accepted the American solution to the reparations issues, as expressed in the [[Dawes Plan]].

French military strategy was entirely defensive, and it had no intention whatever of invading Germany if war broke out. Instead it planned  to defend the [[Maginot Line]]. Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe. Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion.  without such deterrence, the ally was militarily helpless.  Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality. Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border, which is where Germany invaded in 1940.  Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion, now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising, so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin.

Romania was first neutral and then after Germany defeated France in 1940 it aligned with Germany. The main device France had used was arms sales in order to strengthen Romania and ensure its goodwill. French military promises were vague and not trusted after the sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich in 1938, By 1938 French needed all the arms it could produce.

[https://archive.org/details/worldatarmsgloba00wein online free to borrow]</ref>\n\nIn spring 1940 Germany launched its [[Blitzkrieg]] against Denmark and Norway, easily pushing the British out. Then it invaded the Low Countries and tricked Britain and France into sending their best combat units deep into the Netherlands, where they became trapped in the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940. The Royal Navy rescued over 300,000 British and French soldiers from Dunkirk, but left behind all the equipment.<ref>Joel Blatt, ed., ''The French Defeat of 1940'' (1998)</ref>\n\nParis fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the government surrendered on 24 June 1940. Nazi Germany occupied three-fifths of France's territory, leaving the rest in the southeast to the new Vichy government, which was a bit more than a puppet state since it still had a navy.  However nearly 2 million French soldiers became prisoners of war in Germany. They served as hostages and forced laborers in German factories. The United States suddenly realized Germany was on the verge of controlling practically all of Europe, and it determined to rapidly build up its small Army and Air Force, and expand its Navy. Sympathy with Britain was high, and many were willing to send munitions, but few Americans called for war.<ref>Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (1994) ch 3.

Theoretically it was neutral, but in practice it was partly controlled by Germany until November 1942, when Germany took full control. Vichy was intensely conservative and anti-Communist, but it was practically helpless with Germany controlling half of France directly and holding nearly two million French POWs as hostages. Vichy finally collapsed when the Germans fled in summer 1944.<ref>Peter Jackson and Simon Kitson, \"The paradoxes of foreign policy in Vichy France\", in Jonathan Adelman, ed., ''Hitler and His Allies in World War Two'' (Routledge, 2007) pp&nbsp;79\u2013115 [https://www.amazon.com/Hitler-His-Allies-World-War/dp/0415321670/  excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\nThe United States granted Vichy full diplomatic recognition, sending Admiral [[William D. Leahy]] to Paris as American ambassador. President Roosevelt hoped to use American influence to encourage those elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. Vichy still controlled its overseas colonies and Washington encouraged Vichy to resist German demands such as for air bases in Syria or to move war supplies through French North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. When Germany took full control the U.S. and Canada cut their ties.<ref>William Langer, ''Our Vichy gamble'' (1947)</ref>\n\n====French fleet====\nBritain feared that the French naval fleet could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining north Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the [[French Navy]], the ''Marine Nationale'', under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to far away territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. Shortly after France gave up it attacked a large French naval contingent in [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]], killing 1,297 French military personnel. Vichy severed diplomatic relations but did not declare war on Britain. Churchill also ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. The French squadron at [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], under Admiral [[Ren\u00e9-Emile Godfroy]], was effectively interned until 1943.\n\nThe American position towards Vichy France and Free France was inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, and agreed with Ambassador Leahy's view that he was an \"apprentice dictator.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjLKYL3xbmAC&pg=PA160|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=160|isbn=9781107031265}}</ref>\n\n====North Africa====\nPreparing for a landing in North Africa in late 1942, the US looked for a top French ally. It turned to [[Henri Giraud]] shortly before the landing on 8 November 1942, but he had little local support. By hapstance the Vichy leader Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] was captured and supported the Americans. The Allies, with General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in charge,  signed a deal with Admiral Darlan on 22 November 1942 in which the Allies recognized Darlan as high commissioner for North Africa and West Africa.<ref>Arthur L.

Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942, so Washington turned again towards Giraud, who was made High Commissioner of French North and West Africa. Giraud failed to build a political base and was displaced by the last man with any standing, de Gaulle.<ref>Martin Thomas, \"The Discarded Leader: General Henri Giraud and the Foundation of the French Committee of National Liberation\", ''French History'' (1996) 10#12 pp&nbsp;86\u2013111</ref><ref>Adrienne Doris Hytier, ''Two Years of French Foreign Policy: Vichy, 1940\u20131942'' (1958) [https://www.questia.com/library/405717/two-years-of-french-foreign-policy-vichy-1940-1942 online]</ref>\n\n===Free France===\n{{see also|Free French Forces}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]] -->\n\nFree France was the insurgent French government based in London and the overseas French colonies and led by charismatic general [[Charles de Gaulle]].

When the British and Americans landed in France in June 1944, he refused to allow French soldiers to land on D-Day. He insisted that France be treated as a great power by the other Allies, and that he himself was the only representative of France. Roosevelt disliked him, but he had Churchill's support. The U.S. and Britain allowed de Gaulle the honor of being the first to march into Paris at the head of his army after the Germans had fled.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''DeGaulle: The Rebel, 1890\u20131944'' (1990) pp&nbsp;515\u201327</ref>\n\nCommunists played a major role in the French resistance, and the USSR was leading the fight against Germany, so De Gaulle emphasized that Free France supported the USSR.<ref>Robert Gildea, ''France since 1945'' (2002) pp 30-35.</ref> Relations cooled in fall 1943 to summer 1944, then warmed up again and de Gaulle visited Moscow.

None of the  Big Three wanted to pretend that France was a power again, so it was not invited to the decisive Yalta conference in February 1945, which was humiliating.  Furthermore, Communist efforts to seize power in Poland Europe, as directed by Stalin, were worrisome to the French. With Roosevelt replaced by Harry Truman, De Gaulle increasingly turned to the American presence to maintain balance of power.<ref>John Young, \"Stalin and de Gaulle\", ''History Today'' (June 1990) 40#6.</ref>\n\n==Fourth Republic, 1944\u20131958==\n{{Further|French Fourth Republic|Cold War}}\n\nThe [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP), a large moderate party based on the Catholic vote, dominated French foreign and colonial policies during most of the later 1940s and 1950s. Along with the French Socialist Party, it was the most energetic supporter in the country of European integration. It was also a strong backer of [[NATO]] and of close alliance with the United States, making it the most \"Atlanticist\" of French political parties.  Its leaders, especially [[Georges Bidault]] and [[Paul Coste-Floret]] (foreign and colonial ministers respectively in several French coalition governments) were primary architects of France's hard-line colonial policies that culminated in long insurgencies in [[Vietnam]] (1946\u20131954) and [[Algeria]] (1954\u20131962), as well as a series of smaller insurrections and political crises elsewhere in the French Empire. The MRP eventually divided over the Algerian question in the late 1950s (with Bidault being an avid supporter of the [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]]).<ref>Russell Beckett Capelle, ''The MRP and French foreign policy'' (1963).

Fighting between French forces and their Communist opponents known as the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] began in September 1945. The conflict pitted a range of forces, including the [[French Union]]'s [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]], led by [[French Fourth Republic|France]] and supported by Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]'s [[Vietnamese National Army]] against the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]]. Most of the fighting took place in [[Tonkin]] in Northern Vietnam, along with Chinese border. The conflict eventually reached most of Vietnam and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].\n\nAfter the Japanese surrendered, Chinese forces in September 1945 entered Tonkin and a small British task force landed at Saigon. The Chinese accepted the Vietnamese government under Ho Chi Minh, created by resistance forces of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, then in power in Hanoi. The British refused to do likewise in Saigon, and deferred to the French there from the outset, against the ostensible support of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh by American [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] representatives. On [[V-J Day]], September 2, Ho Chi Minh, had proclaimed in Hanoi the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV). The DRV ruled as the only civil government in all of Vietnam for a period of about 20 days, after the abdication of the \"Japanese puppet\", Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i.  On 23 September 1945,  French forces overthrew the local DRV government, and declared French authority restored in Cochinchina.

Pompidou tried to closely follow de Gaulle's policies, but he totally lacked the General's charisma, innovation and ability to startled friends and enemies alike. He lacked experience and a smooth hand, and for the first two years most of his initiatives proved failures. Fortunately for his domestic popularity, the French people paid little attention to foreign affairs.  In terms of Mediterranean policy, he made an effort to foster closer relations with North African and Middle Eastern countries in order to develop a hinterland including all nations bordering the Mediterranean. However, de Gaulle had favored the  Arab cause against the Israelis, especially in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 in which Israel, under attack from all directions, decisively defeated  all its Arab neighbors. Pompidou continued the hostility, and tried to come to terms with Morocco as well. He tried to sell French weapons to [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Qaddafi]], the reckless dictator of Libya. An outburst of international hostility scuttled that adventure. His greatest disaster came and Algeria, Which doubled its taxes on French-owned oilfields, and finally nationalized them in 1971.

Impelled \"by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique\", Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.<ref>James Nathan, \"Force, Order, and Diplomacy in the Age of Louis XIV.\" Virginia Quarterly Review'' 69#4 (1993) 633+.</ref>\n\nWhile his battlefield generals were not especially good, Louis XIV had excellent support staff. His chief engineer [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] (1633\u20131707) perfected the arts of fortifying French towns and besieging enemy cities. The finance minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] (1619\u201383) dramatically improved the financial system so that it could support an army of 250,000 men. The system deteriorated under Louis XV so that wars drained the increasingly inefficient financial system.  Louis XIV made France prouder in psychology but poorer in wealth; military glory and cultural splendor were exalted above economic growth.<ref>Cathal J.

There were also two lesser conflicts: the [[War of Devolution]] and the [[War of the Reunions]].\n\nLouis XV did merge [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Corsica]] into France.  However France was badly defeated in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1754\u20131763) and forced to give up its holdings in North America.  It ceded [[New France]] to Great Britain and Louisiana to Spain, and was left with a bitter grudge that sought revenge in 1778 by helping the Americans win independence.  Louis XV's decisions damaged the power of France, weakened the treasury, discredited the absolute monarchy, and made it more vulnerable to distrust and destruction, as happened in the [[French Revolution]], which broke out 15 years after his death.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

Motivated by a long-term rivalry with Britain and by revenge for its territorial losses during Seven Years' War, France began secretly sending supplies in 1775.  In 1777, American captured the British invasion army at Saratoga, demonstrating the viability of their revolt. In 1778, France recognized the United States of America as a sovereign nation, signed a military alliance and went to war with Britain. France built a coalitions with Netherlands and Spain, provided Americans with money and arms, sent a combat army to serve under [[George Washington]], and sent a navy that prevented the second British army from escaping from Yorktown in 1781.<ref>Jonathan R.

Following their victory at [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Fleurus]], the French occupied Belgium and the Rhineland. An invasion of the Netherlands established the puppet [[Batavian Republic]].

Britain led a series of shifting coalitions to oppose him.  After a brief truce in 1802\u20133, war resumed. In 1806 Prussia joined Britain and Russia, thus forming the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]]. Napoleon was not alone since he now had a complex network of allies and subject states.  The largely outnumbered French army crushed the Prussian army at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena-Auerstedt]] in 1806; Napoleon captured Berlin and went as far as Eastern Prussia. There the Russian Empire was defeated at the [[Battle of Friedland]] (14 June 1807). Peace was dictated in the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], in which Russia had to join the [[Continental System]], and Prussia handed half of its territories to France. The [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was formed over these territorial losses, and Polish troops entered the Grande Arm\u00e9e in significant numbers.<ref>Steven T.

Only two countries remained neutral in the war: Sweden and Portugal, and Napoleon then looked toward the latter. In the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], a Franco-Spanish alliance against Portugal was sealed as Spain eyed Portuguese territories. French armies entered Spain in order to attack Portugal, but then seized Spanish fortresses and took over the kingdom by surprise. [[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, was made King of Spain after [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] abdicated. This occupation of the Iberian peninsula fueled local nationalism, and soon the Spanish and Portuguese fought the French using [[guerrilla tactics]], defeating the French forces at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] (June and July 1808). Britain sent a short-lived ground support force to Portugal, and French forces evacuated Portugal as defined in the [[Convention of Sintra]] following the Allied victory at [[Battle of Vimeiro|Vimeiro]] (21 August 1808). France only controlled [[Catalonia]] and [[Navarre]] and could have been definitely expelled from the Iberian peninsula had the Spanish armies attacked again, but the Spanish did not.<ref>Charles J. Esdaile, ''Fighting Napoleon: Guerrillas, Bandits & Adventurers in Spain, 1808\u20131814'' (2004).</ref>\n\nAnother French attack was launched on Spain, led by Napoleon himself, and was described as \"an avalanche of fire and steel.\" However, the French Empire was no longer regarded as invincible by European powers. In 1808 Austria formed the [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Fifth Coalition]] in order to break down the French Empire. The Austrian Empire defeated the French at [[Battle of Aspern-Essling|Aspern-Essling]], yet was beaten at [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]] while the Polish allies defeated the Austrian Empire at [[Battle of Raszyn (1809)|Raszyn]] (April 1809). Although not as decisive as the previous Austrian defeats, the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|peace treaty]] in October 1809 stripped Austria of a large amount of territories, reducing it even more.\n\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|250px|Napoleon Bonaparte retreating from Moscow, by [[Adolf Northern]].]]\n\nIn 1812 Napoleon could no longer tolerate Russian independence. He assembled a gigantic army and invaded. The [[French invasion of Russia (1812)]] Was a total disaster, caused primarily by weather, partisan attacks, disease and inadequate logistics.  Only small remnants of the invading army returned from Russia. On the Spanish front the French armies were defeated and evacuated Spain.<ref>Michael Adams, ''Napoleon and Russia'' (2006)</ref>\n\nSince France had been defeated on these two fronts, states it previously conquered and controlled struck back. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] was formed, and the German states of the Confederation of the Rhine switched sides, finally opposing Napoleon. Napoleon was defeated in the [[Battle of Leipzig|Battle of the Nations]] outside Leipzig in October 1813. The Allies invaded France and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814. The [[Conservative Order|conservative]] [[Congress of Vienna]] reversed the political changes that had occurred during the wars. Napoleon's attempted restoration, a period known as the [[Hundred Days]], ended with his final defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.  The monarchy was restored with [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] as king, followed by his brother.  France was soon integrated into the reactionary international situation.

The Bourbons were restored, but left a weak record and one branch was overthrown in 1830 and the other branch in 1848 as Napoleon's nephew was elected president. He made himself emperor as [[Napoleon III]] and lasted until he was defeated and captured by Prussians in 1870 a war that humiliated France and made the new nation of Germany dominant in the continent. France built up an empire, especially in Africa and Indochina. The economy was strong, with a good railway system.

Religious and class differences deeply divided the French people on polarities such as monarchy versus Republicanism, secularism versus Catholicism, farmers versus urbanites, workers versus owners. Permanent professional diplomats and bureaucrats had developed their own  traditions of how to operate  at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (where the Foreign Ministry was located), and their style  changed little from generation to generation.  Most of the diplomats came from high status or aristocratic families.  Although France was one of the few republics in Europe, its diplomats mingled smoothly with the aristocratic representatives at the royal courts.  Prime ministers and leading politicians generally paid little attention to foreign affairs, allowing a handful of senior men to control policy.  In the decades before the First World War they dominated the embassies in the 10 major countries were France had an ambassador (elsewhere, they set lower-ranking ministers).  They included [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the foreign minister from 1898 to 1906; [[Paul Cambon]],  the ambassador in London, 1890\u20131920; [[Jean Jules Jusserand]] in Washington from 1902 to 1924; and Camille Barrere, in Rome from 1897 to 1924.  In terms of foreign policy, there was general agreement about the need for high protective tariffs, which kept agricultural prices high.  After the defeat by the Germans, there was a strong widespread anti-German sentiment focused on revanchism and regaining Alsace and Lorraine.  The Empire was a matter of great pride, and service as administrators, soldiers and missionaries was a high status, occupation.<ref>Felix Gilbert, David Clay Large, ''The End of the European Era: 1890 to the Present'' (2002) p 64\u201365.</ref><ref>J.

It oppressed Poland, and exiled, and even executed political liberals and radicals. At a time when French Republicans were rallying in the [[Dreyfus affair]] against anti-Semitism, Russia was the most notorious center in the world of anti-Semitic outrages, including multiple murderous large-scale pogroms against the Jews. On the other hand, France was increasingly frustrated by Bismarck's success in isolating it diplomatically. France had issues with Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance. Paris made a few overtures to Berlin, but they were rebuffed, and after 1900 there was a threat of war between France and Germany over Germany's attempt to deny French expansion into Morocco. Great Britain was still in its \"splendid isolation\" mode and after a major agreement in 1890 with Germany, it seemed especially favorable toward Berlin. Colonial conflicts in Africa brought Britain and France to a major crisis The Fashoda crisis of 1898 brought Britain and France almost to the brink of war and ended with a humiliation of France that left it hostile to Britain. By 1892 Russia was the only opportunity for France to break out of its diplomatic isolation. Russia had been allied with Germany the new Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890 and in 1892 ended the \"Reinsurance treaty\" with Russia. Russia was now alone diplomatically and like France, it needed a military alliance to contain the threat of Germany's strong army and military aggressiveness. The pope, angered by German anti-Catholicism, worked diplomatically to bring Paris and St. Petersburg together. Russia desperately needed money for our infrastructure of railways and ports facilities. The German government refused to allow its banks to lend money to Russia, but French banks eagerly did so. For example, it funded the essential trans-Siberian railway. Negotiations were increasingly successful, and by 1895. France and Russia had signed the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], a strong military alliance to join together in war if Germany attacked either of them.  France had finally escaped its diplomatic isolation.<ref>John B.  Wolf, ''France 1814\u20131919: The rise of a Liberal-Democratic Society'' (1963)</ref><ref>William L.

The plan seemed to promise quick victory but it failed because of inadequate forces, unexpected Belgian resistance, and poor coordination among German generals. France had already launched its invasion of Germany with [[Plan XVII]], but very quickly realized it needed to defend Paris at all costs. It did so at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] {{nowrap|(5\u201312 September),}}; the German armies were defeated and forced back.  The war became stalemated on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], with practically no movement until spring 1918. Both sides suffered very high casualties caused by repeated infantry attacks against defensive positions protected by trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, and heavy artillery using aircraft as spotters, and poison gas.  Meanwhile, the rich industrial and mining regions of Belgium and northeastern France remained in German hands throughout the war.  Marshals [[Joseph Joffre]] (1852\u20131931) and [[Douglas Haig]] (1861\u20131928) believed that attrition would win the war by wearing down the German reserves in multiple massive assaults. German general [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] (1861\u20131922) was outnumbered and focused on defense.

Inflation heavily damaged the German middle class (Whose bank accounts became worthless) but it also damaged the French franc.

French military strategy was entirely defensive, and it had no intention whatever of invading Germany if war broke out. Instead it planned  to defend the [[Maginot Line]]. Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe. Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion.  without such deterrence, the ally was militarily helpless.  Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality. Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border, which is where Germany invaded in 1940.  Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion, now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising, so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin.

Romania was first neutral and then after Germany defeated France in 1940 it aligned with Germany. The main device France had used was arms sales in order to strengthen Romania and ensure its goodwill. French military promises were vague and not trusted after the sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich in 1938, By 1938 French needed all the arms it could produce.

However nearly 2 million French soldiers became prisoners of war in Germany. They served as hostages and forced laborers in German factories. The United States suddenly realized Germany was on the verge of controlling practically all of Europe, and it determined to rapidly build up its small Army and Air Force, and expand its Navy.

Vichy still controlled its overseas colonies and Washington encouraged Vichy to resist German demands such as for air bases in Syria or to move war supplies through French North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. When Germany took full control the U.S. and Canada cut their ties.<ref>William Langer, ''Our Vichy gamble'' (1947)</ref>\n\n====French fleet====\nBritain feared that the French naval fleet could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining north Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the [[French Navy]], the ''Marine Nationale'', under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to far away territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. Shortly after France gave up it attacked a large French naval contingent in [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]], killing 1,297 French military personnel. Vichy severed diplomatic relations but did not declare war on Britain. Churchill also ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. The French squadron at [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], under Admiral [[Ren\u00e9-Emile Godfroy]], was effectively interned until 1943.\n\nThe American position towards Vichy France and Free France was inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, and agreed with Ambassador Leahy's view that he was an \"apprentice dictator.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjLKYL3xbmAC&pg=PA160|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=160|isbn=9781107031265}}</ref>\n\n====North Africa====\nPreparing for a landing in North Africa in late 1942, the US looked for a top French ally. It turned to [[Henri Giraud]] shortly before the landing on 8 November 1942, but he had little local support. By hapstance the Vichy leader Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] was captured and supported the Americans. The Allies, with General [[Dwight D.

Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942, so Washington turned again towards Giraud, who was made High Commissioner of French North and West Africa. Giraud failed to build a political base and was displaced by the last man with any standing, de Gaulle.<ref>Martin Thomas, \"The Discarded Leader: General Henri Giraud and the Foundation of the French Committee of National Liberation\", ''French History'' (1996) 10#12 pp&nbsp;86\u2013111</ref><ref>Adrienne Doris Hytier, ''Two Years of French Foreign Policy: Vichy, 1940\u20131942'' (1958) [https://www.questia.com/library/405717/two-years-of-french-foreign-policy-vichy-1940-1942 online]</ref>\n\n===Free France===\n{{see also|Free French Forces}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]] -->\n\nFree France was the insurgent French government based in London and the overseas French colonies and led by charismatic general [[Charles de Gaulle]].

When the British and Americans landed in France in June 1944, he refused to allow French soldiers to land on D-Day. He insisted that France be treated as a great power by the other Allies, and that he himself was the only representative of France. Roosevelt disliked him, but he had Churchill's support. The U.S. and Britain allowed de Gaulle the honor of being the first to march into Paris at the head of his army after the Germans had fled.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''DeGaulle: The Rebel, 1890\u20131944'' (1990) pp&nbsp;515\u201327</ref>\n\nCommunists played a major role in the French resistance, and the USSR was leading the fight against Germany, so De Gaulle emphasized that Free France supported the USSR.<ref>Robert Gildea, ''France since 1945'' (2002) pp 30-35.</ref> Relations cooled in fall 1943 to summer 1944, then warmed up again and de Gaulle visited Moscow.

None of the  Big Three wanted to pretend that France was a power again, so it was not invited to the decisive Yalta conference in February 1945, which was humiliating.  Furthermore, Communist efforts to seize power in Poland Europe, as directed by Stalin, were worrisome to the French.

Along with the French Socialist Party, it was the most energetic supporter in the country of European integration. It was also a strong backer of [[NATO]] and of close alliance with the United States, making it the most \"Atlanticist\" of French political parties.  Its leaders, especially [[Georges Bidault]] and [[Paul Coste-Floret]] (foreign and colonial ministers respectively in several French coalition governments) were primary architects of France's hard-line colonial policies that culminated in long insurgencies in [[Vietnam]] (1946\u20131954) and [[Algeria]] (1954\u20131962), as well as a series of smaller insurrections and political crises elsewhere in the French Empire. The MRP eventually divided over the Algerian question in the late 1950s (with Bidault being an avid supporter of the [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]]).<ref>Russell Beckett Capelle, ''The MRP and French foreign policy'' (1963).

Fighting between French forces and their Communist opponents known as the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] began in September 1945. The conflict pitted a range of forces, including the [[French Union]]'s [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]], led by [[French Fourth Republic|France]] and supported by Emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]'s [[Vietnamese National Army]] against the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]]. Most of the fighting took place in [[Tonkin]] in Northern Vietnam, along with Chinese border. The conflict eventually reached most of Vietnam and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]].\n\nAfter the Japanese surrendered, Chinese forces in September 1945 entered Tonkin and a small British task force landed at Saigon. The Chinese accepted the Vietnamese government under Ho Chi Minh, created by resistance forces of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, then in power in Hanoi. The British refused to do likewise in Saigon, and deferred to the French there from the outset, against the ostensible support of the Vi\u1ec7t Minh by American [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] representatives. On [[V-J Day]], September 2, Ho Chi Minh, had proclaimed in Hanoi the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV). The DRV ruled as the only civil government in all of Vietnam for a period of about 20 days, after the abdication of the \"Japanese puppet\", Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i.  On 23 September 1945,  French forces overthrew the local DRV government, and declared French authority restored in Cochinchina.

Pompidou tried to closely follow de Gaulle's policies, but he totally lacked the General's charisma, innovation and ability to startled friends and enemies alike. He lacked experience and a smooth hand, and for the first two years most of his initiatives proved failures. Fortunately for his domestic popularity, the French people paid little attention to foreign affairs.  In terms of Mediterranean policy, he made an effort to foster closer relations with North African and Middle Eastern countries in order to develop a hinterland including all nations bordering the Mediterranean. However, de Gaulle had favored the  Arab cause against the Israelis, especially in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 in which Israel, under attack from all directions, decisively defeated  all its Arab neighbors. Pompidou continued the hostility, and tried to come to terms with Morocco as well. He tried to sell French weapons to [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Qaddafi]], the reckless dictator of Libya. An outburst of international hostility scuttled that adventure. His greatest disaster came and Algeria, Which doubled its taxes on French-owned oilfields, and finally nationalized them in 1971.

New US President [[Richard Nixon]] and his top adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] admired Pompidou; the politicians were in agreement on most major policy issues.

His family had four generations of [[classical music]]ians. His father, Emil von Grof\u00e9, was a [[baritone]] who sang mainly light opera; his mother, Elsa Johanna Bierlich von Grof\u00e9, a professional [[cellist]], was also a versatile music teacher who taught Ferde to play the [[violin]] and [[piano]]. Elsa's father, Bernardt Bierlich, was a cellist in the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Orchestra in New York and Elsa's brother, Julius Bierlich, was first violinist and [[concertmaster]] of the Los Angeles Symphony.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&pg=PA1204&lpg=PA1204&dq=bernardt+bierlich+obituary&source=bl&ots=KWcIvULbV1&sig=ACfU3U3PjNHbCWnf8eH0L822BTqp77k8aA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjiha71-rDnAhVqUt8KHRT-C5gQ6AEwAnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=bernardt%20bierlich%20obituary&f=false Green's Biographical Encylopedia of Composers.

Ferde became proficient on a wide range of instruments including piano (his favored instrument), violin, viola (he became a violist in the LA Symphony), [[baritone horn]], [[alto horn]] and [[cornet]]. This command of musical instruments and composition gave Ferde the foundation to become, first an arranger of other composers' music, and then a composer in his own right.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ferde Grof\u00e9 - American Composer |url= https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferde-Grofe |date= |year=2020 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |location= |id= }}</ref>\n\nGrof\u00e9 left home at age 14 and variously worked as a milkman, truck driver, usher, newsboy, elevator operator, helper in a book bindery, iron factory worker, and played in a [[piano bar]] for two dollars a night and as an [[accompanist]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.naxos.com/person/Ferde_Grof%C3%A9/26084.htm |title=Ferde Grof\u00e9 |author=<!--Unknown--> |date= |website=Naxos.com |publisher= |access-date=February 2, 2020 |quote=}}</ref> He continued studying piano and violin.

He served as Whiteman's chief arranger from 1920 to 1932. He made hundreds of arrangements of popular songs, Broadway show music, and tunes of all types for Whiteman.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rayno |first=Don |authorlink=Don Rayno |date=2003 |title=Paul Whiteman: Pioneer in American Music, Volume One 1890-1930}}</ref>\n\nGrof\u00e9's most memorable arrangement is that of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which established Grof\u00e9's reputation among jazz musicians. Grof\u00e9 took what Gershwin had written for two pianos and orchestrated it for Whiteman's jazz orchestra. He transformed Gershwin's musical canvas with the colors and many of the creative touches for which it is so well known. He went on to create two more arrangements of the piece in later years.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Rhapsody in Blue |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rhapsody-in-Blue-by-Gershwin |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |date= |year=2020 |publisher= |location= |id= }}</ref> Grof\u00e9's 1942 orchestration for full orchestra of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' is the one most frequently heard today.

The \"On the Trail\" segment of ''Grand Canyon Suite'' was used for many years as the \"musical signature\" for radio and television programs sponsored by [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] cigarettes, beginning with their 1933 radio program featuring Grof\u00e9 and his orchestra and concluding with ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (1951\u201357). Jon Hendricks wrote lyrics for ''On the Trail'', and the song was recorded for Hendricks' album ''To Tell the Truth'' (1975). The piano version sheet music of the suite includes lyrics to the central section of \"On the Trail\" by songwriter [[Gus Kahn]].\n\nSeveral times he conducted orchestral programs in New York's [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>''New York Times'', \"Orchestra at Carnegie Hall meets enthusiastic crowd\", January 10, 1937.</ref><ref>''New York Times'', \"Grof\u00e9 Guest Conductor at Benefit Concert for 'Free Milk Fund for Babies', March 25, 1938.</ref>\n\nIn January 1933 the premiere of his ''Tabloid Suite'', an orchestral suite in 4 movements, was presented in Carnegie Hall.<ref>''New York Times'', January 26, 1933.</ref> In 1937, he conducted a concert tribute to George Gershwin at [[Lewisohn Stadium]].

In 1944, he was a panelist on ''A Song Is Born'' radio show, judging the works of unknown composers. Before that time he had served several times as judge or co-judge in musical contests. Grof\u00e9 was later employed as a [[conducting|conductor]] and faculty member at the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard School of Music]] where he taught [[orchestration]].\n\n==Grof\u00e9's compositions==\nIn addition to being an arranger, Grof\u00e9 was also a composer in his own right. While still with Whiteman, in 1926, he wrote ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'', which Whiteman recorded in shortened format in 1927. He wrote a number of other pieces, including a theme for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 New York World's Fair]] and suites for [[Niagara Falls]] and the [[Hudson River]]. Possibly as a result of his World's Fair theme, 13 October 1940 was designated Ferde Grof\u00e9 Day at the American pavilion of the World's Fair.<ref>''New York Times'', 14 October 1940</ref>  Grof\u00e9 conducted his ''[[Niagara Falls Suite]]'' as part of the ceremony marking the opening of the first stage of the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara Falls Power Generation]] project.<ref>''New York Times'', 7 February 1961</ref>\n\nOther notable compositions by Grof\u00e9 were the ''[[Death Valley Suite]]'' and a music production about [[Mark Twain]]. ''Death Valley Suite'' is a short symphonic suite written by Grof\u00e9 in 1949, depicting the westward travels of pioneers through the 'harsh lands' of [[Death Valley]] in California. Grof\u00e9 was commissioned by the Death Valley 49ers, a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving pioneering and mining history of the [[Death Valley]] region encompassing Death Valley National Monument (now [[Death Valley National Park]]) and surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathvalley49ers.org/|title=About Us|website=deathvalley49ers.org/|publisher=Death Valley 49ers|last1=49ers|first1=Death Valley|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> The composition and music was part of a pageant performed on December 3, 1949 celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 49ers who came by way of Death Valley in search of gold and other riches and celebration of the [[California]] state centennial (1850\u20131950).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grofe|first1=Ferde|title=Ferde Grofe|date=1949|publisher=Grofe and State of California|url=http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092151/http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 1949 pageant setting was outdoors at Desolation Canyon in Death Valley.

The earlier ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'' along with the later ''Death Valley Suite'' are occasionally performed and are recorded. Grof\u00e9 conducted the [[Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his ''Grand Canyon Suite'' and his piano concerto (with pianist [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1]]) for [[Everest Records]] in 1960; the recording was digitally remastered and issued on CD in 1997.\n\nIn 1958, [[Walt Disney]] released a live-action, short subject film of the [[Grand Canyon]] using the Grand Canyon Suite music. The thirty-minute Technicolor and [[CinemaScope]] film, entitled ''[[Grand Canyon (1958 film)]]'', used no actors or dialogue, simply shots of the Grand Canyon itself and several animals around the area, all shown with Grof\u00e9's music accompanying the visuals.

In 1945 he also sold his [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], home.<ref>''New York Times'', 1945</ref>\n\nGrof\u00e9 married his first wife, Mildred Grizzelle, a soprano singer, in 1916, and divorced in 1928. In May 1951, he filed for divorce in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], from his second wife, Ruth, whom he had married in 1929. The day after the divorce was granted, he married his third wife, Anna May Lampton (13 January 1952).<ref>''New York Times'', 13 January 1952</ref>\n\n==Death==\nFerde Grof\u00e9 died in [[Santa Monica, California]], on April 3, 1972, aged 80, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Golden West at the Inglewood Park Cemetery in [[Inglewood, California]].

His family had four generations of [[classical music]]ians. His father, Emil von Grof\u00e9, was a [[baritone]] who sang mainly light opera; his mother, Elsa Johanna Bierlich von Grof\u00e9, a professional [[cellist]], was also a versatile music teacher who taught Ferde to play the [[violin]] and [[piano]].

Ferde became proficient on a wide range of instruments including piano (his favored instrument), violin, viola (he became a violist in the LA Symphony), [[baritone horn]], [[alto horn]] and [[cornet]].

Grof\u00e9 took what Gershwin had written for two pianos and orchestrated it for Whiteman's jazz orchestra.

Jon Hendricks wrote lyrics for ''On the Trail'', and the song was recorded for Hendricks' album ''To Tell the Truth'' (1975).

In 1944, he was a panelist on ''A Song Is Born'' radio show, judging the works of unknown composers. Before that time he had served several times as judge or co-judge in musical contests. Grof\u00e9 was later employed as a [[conducting|conductor]] and faculty member at the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard School of Music]] where he taught [[orchestration]].\n\n==Grof\u00e9's compositions==\nIn addition to being an arranger, Grof\u00e9 was also a composer in his own right. While still with Whiteman, in 1926, he wrote ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'', which Whiteman recorded in shortened format in 1927. He wrote a number of other pieces, including a theme for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 New York World's Fair]] and suites for [[Niagara Falls]] and the [[Hudson River]]. Possibly as a result of his World's Fair theme, 13 October 1940 was designated Ferde Grof\u00e9 Day at the American pavilion of the World's Fair.<ref>''New York Times'', 14 October 1940</ref>  Grof\u00e9 conducted his ''[[Niagara Falls Suite]]'' as part of the ceremony marking the opening of the first stage of the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara Falls Power Generation]] project.<ref>''New York Times'', 7 February 1961</ref>\n\nOther notable compositions by Grof\u00e9 were the ''[[Death Valley Suite]]'' and a music production about [[Mark Twain]]. ''Death Valley Suite'' is a short symphonic suite written by Grof\u00e9 in 1949, depicting the westward travels of pioneers through the 'harsh lands' of [[Death Valley]] in California. Grof\u00e9 was commissioned by the Death Valley 49ers, a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving pioneering and mining history of the [[Death Valley]] region encompassing Death Valley National Monument (now [[Death Valley National Park]]) and surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathvalley49ers.org/|title=About Us|website=deathvalley49ers.org/|publisher=Death Valley 49ers|last1=49ers|first1=Death Valley|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> The composition and music was part of a pageant performed on December 3, 1949 celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 49ers who came by way of Death Valley in search of gold and other riches and celebration of the [[California]] state centennial (1850\u20131950).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grofe|first1=Ferde|title=Ferde Grofe|date=1949|publisher=Grofe and State of California|url=http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|access-date=2014-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092151/http://www.ferde-grofe.net/scores/Desert_Water_Hole_Preview.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 1949 pageant setting was outdoors at Desolation Canyon in Death Valley.

The earlier ''[[Mississippi Suite]]'' along with the later ''Death Valley Suite'' are occasionally performed and are recorded. Grof\u00e9 conducted the [[Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his ''Grand Canyon Suite'' and his piano concerto (with pianist [[Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1]]) for [[Everest Records]] in 1960; the recording was digitally remastered and issued on CD in 1997.\n\nIn 1958, [[Walt Disney]] released a live-action, short subject film of the [[Grand Canyon]] using the Grand Canyon Suite music. The thirty-minute Technicolor and [[CinemaScope]] film, entitled ''[[Grand Canyon (1958 film)]]'', used no actors or dialogue, simply shots of the Grand Canyon itself and several animals around the area, all shown with Grof\u00e9's music accompanying the visuals.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

It is the capital of [[\u015awiebodzin County]]. Since the Local Government Reorganization Act of 1998, \u015awiebodzin has been part of [[Lubusz Voivodeship]]. It was formerly part of the [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Voivodeship]] (1975\u20131998).\n\n\u015awiebodzin is an important transportation hub, lying at the crossroads of the Polish [[National roads in Poland#List of national roads|national roads 2 and 3]]. The [[Autostrada A2 (Poland)|A2 motorway]] and [[Expressway S3 (Poland)|S3 expressway]] cross near the town. \u015awiebodzin is located {{convert|39|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], one of the two voivodeship's capitals, {{convert|195|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Pozna\u0144]]; {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Germany|German]] border and {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Berlin]].

As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it initially was part of [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], and later it was part of [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]]. The earliest historical records which mention ''Sebusianis, Sipusius Silesius, Suebosian, Soebosian, Suebusianus'' for today's \u015awiebodzin date from the beginning of the 14th century, when the area belonged to the [[Lower Silesia]]n Polish-ruled [[Duchy of G\u0142og\u00f3w]]. The town sprang up at the intersection of the old trade routes linking Silesia with [[Pomerania]] and a branch of the route running from [[Lusatia]] to [[Pozna\u0144]] in [[Greater Poland]] and further to [[Pomerelia]]. Initially, the town was probably a defensive fortification, built on the western banks of Lake Zamecko at a slight elevation. The town wall was ringed by settlements, which were much later incorporated into the city itself.\n[[File:Silesia map.png|thumb|left|Bohemian Silesia (green) with northern \u015awiebodzin exclave]]\nIn 1319 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] margrave [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar of Ascania]] conquered \u015awiebodzin and the town of [[Sulech\u00f3w]] to its south. He died in the same year and the territory fell back to the [[Silesian Piasts]], who in 1329 became vassals of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], an Electorate of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When in 1476 Duke [[Henry XI of G\u0142og\u00f3w]] died without issue, fights over his succession broke out between Duke [[Jan II the Mad]] of [[Duchy of \u017baga\u0144|\u017baga\u0144]] and the Brandenburg Elector [[Albrecht III, Elector of Brandenburg|Albert III Achilles of Hohenzollern]], who in ca.1479 was able to acquire the northern part of the duchy with the towns of Crossen ([[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie]]) and Z\u00fcllichau (Sulech\u00f3w), which were incorporated into the [[Neumark]] district of Brandenburg in 1537. The area of \u015awiebodzin however remained a Bohemian fief, becoming an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the Silesian crown land which in 1526 passed with the Bohemian Kingdom to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:\u015awiebodzin - fotopolska.eu (146819).jpg|thumb|right|Partial view of the town square]]\nBecause of the town's location at an important crossroads, it developed economically, particularly in the areas of commerce and craft production. In the 15th century and particularly in the 16th century, Schwiebus was known for manufacturing beer and exporting cloth. It also developed various urban handicrafts and manufactured goods for local purposes (the weekly market). The salt, wool, grain, horse, and beef trades were also important.\nFor a time the Schwiebus territory was granted by the emperor to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04519949&id=nduuOHX8Nl8C&pg=RA2-PA299&lpg=RA2-PA299&dq=schwiebus#PRA2-PA296,M1 |title=Complete Works of Thomas Carlyle ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2005-11-08 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Representatives of well-known Silesian families, including the von Knobelsdorffs, among others, held authority and power in the town as district [[starost]]s and castle commanders on behalf of the [[Habsburg]]s.\n[[File:Swiebodzin dawny.jpg|thumb|left|17th-century view of the town]]\nBecause of its position near the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s border with the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], the town most likely had a population of mixed [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Germans|German]] descent at this time, but Germans were the majority by the [[early modern period]]. During the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries, the town expanded economically, spatially, and demographically, in spite of local conflicts and the turbulent [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].\n\nAfter the victory of King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[Silesian Wars|First Silesian War]] (1740\u20131742), Schwiebus came under [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] administration. In 1817 its territory was merged with the southern Z\u00fcllichau region to form the Z\u00fcllichau-Schwiebus District in the [[Province of Brandenburg]]. Schwiebus remained in this territorial form until 1945. Annexation by Prussia brought about a sharp economic crisis, as the tradesmen of Schwiebus were cut off from many of their traditional markets and outlets. The Prussian authorities also increased local taxes while limiting the town's autonomy. The period of revolutions and [[Napoleonic wars]] brought about a depression in the cloth trade and limited the economic prospects of the town.\n\nThe town's extended stagnation ended with the [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Stein]]-[[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] economic reforms and the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] in the mid-19th century. As a medium-sized town and hub of the local market, lying at the intersection of several routes of communication, including the new [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]-[[Pozna\u0144]] railway line, Schwiebus became a center of local industry (textile, machinery, and agricultural food processing). The town was modernized at this time with improved traffic arteries, renovation of the town hall, reconstruction of the church of St. Michael, and the construction of several new public service buildings (law courts, high school, gas works, and post office). Schwiebus contributed to and benefited from the economic expansion of the [[German Empire]] in the years before 1914.\n\n===20th century===\n{{multiple image|align = right|perrow = 2|total_width=350\n| image1 = \u015awiebodzin, ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 par. pw \u015bw.

In the [[interwar period]], Schwiebus found itself in the eastern outskirts of Germany, twenty kilometers west of the newly imposed German-Polish border. During the 1920s, [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] experienced two major economic crises, the [[hyperinflation]] of the early 1920s and the [[Great Depression]] beginning in 1929. The citizens of Schwiebus suffered severe economic hardship during this time. As was the case elsewhere in Germany, many of the town's citizens were dissatisfied with their lot and turned to political extremism.\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]] of the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933. Hitler quickly moved to consolidate and expand his power, adopting severe repressive measures against his political opposition and the German [[Jew]]ish minority. However, Hitler remained popular with the public because he oversaw the German economic recovery of the 1930s. The new government sponsored many public works programs and a massive rearmament campaign which included the construction of an extensive fortified line of bunkers, ''Ostwall'' (today known as the [[Mi\u0119dzyrzecz Fortified Region]]) twenty kilometers north of Schwiebus.\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u201345) first brought hardship to Schwiebus and then total disaster. In early January 1945, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] began its final advance through Poland into eastern Germany, reaching Schwiebus before the end of the month. By this time, many of its inhabitants had already fled, fearing the Soviet revenge for the atrocities perpetrated by the German occupation forces against the civilian population of the Soviet Union. The town was largely spared from destruction during the fighting, as the bulk of the Soviet forces passed to the north and south on their way to [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]]. It was finally captured in 31 January 1945. The capture was not without casualties.<ref>http://opty.info/nasze-forum/wspomnienia/tragiczne-losy-siostr-boromeuszek-za-swiebodzina/</ref>\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in the war, Schwiebus became \u015awiebodzin, and was once again part of Poland.\n\nThe new Polish government adopted the [[communism|communist economic system]] and enacted sweeping social, economic, and political reforms.  \u015awiebodzin's economic recovery was also hampered by the Soviet policy of dismantling industrial facilities in conquered areas, and shipping components back to the Soviet Union. In this way, \u015awiebodzin lost some of its prewar industries, particularly its breweries.\n\n\u015awiebodzin expanded in the period under communist rule, and its population doubled. New neighborhoods were built to the south of the railway line, composed largely of [[Plattenbau|pre-fabricated apartment buildings]]. The Communist Economic Planning Commissions chose to develop the electromechanical, furniture, and timber industries in \u015awiebodzin. Products were exported throughout Poland and to the other states in the [[Soviet Bloc]].\n\nHowever, with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the [[revolutions of 1989]], \u015awiebodzin once again experienced economic upheaval. With some difficulties, the local economy was adapted to the international [[market economy]]. New industries and businesses were established, but others were unable to compete in the new environment and went bankrupt. Many more goods became available in local shops, but at prices that many inhabitants could not afford. In recent years, a few foreign-owned discount supermarkets, pizzerias, hotels, and other businesses have been established in the town, taking advantage of the proximity of Poland's main east-west motorway. With the economic changes there have also been political changes. A series of non-communist local governments have been elected since 1989.\n\n==Attractions and sites of interest==\n[[File:Swiebodzin (9662661400).jpg|thumb|left|[[Facade]]s at the market square]]\n[[File:Christ the King Statue \u015awiebodzin 05.jpg|thumb|190px|Statue of ''[[Christ the King (\u015awiebodzin)|Christ the King]]'']]\nThe center of \u015awiebodzin still contains remnants of the town's past as a [[medieval]] walled settlement, including two nearly intact towers and fragments of the town\u2019s [[defensive walls]] and [[bastion]]s. The central [[market square]] is dominated by the [[town hall]], built around 1550 in the [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] style and rebuilt in the 19th century with the addition of its prominent [[clock tower]]. The town hall still contains its original [[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] in the rooms of the Regional Museum and basement cafe. There are two large churches in the town center, the Church of St. Michael the Archangel and the Church of the Mother of God. The Church of St. Michael was first built in the second half of the 15th Century, and its [[gothic revival architecture|neo-gothic]] [[fa\u00e7ade]] was added in the second half of the 19th century. The neo-gothic Church of the Mother of God was built during the [[Imperial Germany|Imperial German]] period as a [[Protestant Church]] but was reconsecrated as a [[Catholic Church]] after World War II.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, assembly of the ''[[Christ the King (\u015awiebodzin)|Christ the King]]'', a giant statue of a crowned [[Jesus Christ]], began on a hill on the outskirts of the town.

It is the capital of [[\u015awiebodzin County]]. Since the Local Government Reorganization Act of 1998, \u015awiebodzin has been part of [[Lubusz Voivodeship]]. It was formerly part of the [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Voivodeship]] (1975\u20131998).\n\n\u015awiebodzin is an important transportation hub, lying at the crossroads of the Polish [[National roads in Poland#List of national roads|national roads 2 and 3]]. The [[Autostrada A2 (Poland)|A2 motorway]] and [[Expressway S3 (Poland)|S3 expressway]] cross near the town. \u015awiebodzin is located {{convert|39|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], one of the two voivodeship's capitals, {{convert|195|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Pozna\u0144]]; {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Germany|German]] border and {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Berlin]].

As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it initially was part of [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]], and later it was part of [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesia]]. The earliest historical records which mention ''Sebusianis, Sipusius Silesius, Suebosian, Soebosian, Suebusianus'' for today's \u015awiebodzin date from the beginning of the 14th century, when the area belonged to the [[Lower Silesia]]n Polish-ruled [[Duchy of G\u0142og\u00f3w]]. The town sprang up at the intersection of the old trade routes linking Silesia with [[Pomerania]] and a branch of the route running from [[Lusatia]] to [[Pozna\u0144]] in [[Greater Poland]] and further to [[Pomerelia]]. Initially, the town was probably a defensive fortification, built on the western banks of Lake Zamecko at a slight elevation. The town wall was ringed by settlements, which were much later incorporated into the city itself.\n[[File:Silesia map.png|thumb|left|Bohemian Silesia (green) with northern \u015awiebodzin exclave]]\nIn 1319 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] margrave [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar of Ascania]] conquered \u015awiebodzin and the town of [[Sulech\u00f3w]] to its south. He died in the same year and the territory fell back to the [[Silesian Piasts]], who in 1329 became vassals of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], an Electorate of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When in 1476 Duke [[Henry XI of G\u0142og\u00f3w]] died without issue, fights over his succession broke out between Duke [[Jan II the Mad]] of [[Duchy of \u017baga\u0144|\u017baga\u0144]] and the Brandenburg Elector [[Albrecht III, Elector of Brandenburg|Albert III Achilles of Hohenzollern]], who in ca.1479 was able to acquire the northern part of the duchy with the towns of Crossen ([[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie]]) and Z\u00fcllichau (Sulech\u00f3w), which were incorporated into the [[Neumark]] district of Brandenburg in 1537. The area of \u015awiebodzin however remained a Bohemian fief, becoming an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the Silesian crown land which in 1526 passed with the Bohemian Kingdom to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\n===Early modern period===\n[[File:\u015awiebodzin - fotopolska.eu (146819).jpg|thumb|right|Partial view of the town square]]\nBecause of the town's location at an important crossroads, it developed economically, particularly in the areas of commerce and craft production. In the 15th century and particularly in the 16th century, Schwiebus was known for manufacturing beer and exporting cloth. It also developed various urban handicrafts and manufactured goods for local purposes (the weekly market). The salt, wool, grain, horse, and beef trades were also important.\nFor a time the Schwiebus territory was granted by the emperor to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04519949&id=nduuOHX8Nl8C&pg=RA2-PA299&lpg=RA2-PA299&dq=schwiebus#PRA2-PA296,M1 |title=Complete Works of Thomas Carlyle ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2005-11-08 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Representatives of well-known Silesian families, including the von Knobelsdorffs, among others, held authority and power in the town as district [[starost]]s and castle commanders on behalf of the [[Habsburg]]s.\n[[File:Swiebodzin dawny.jpg|thumb|left|17th-century view of the town]]\nBecause of its position near the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s border with the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], the town most likely had a population of mixed [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Germans|German]] descent at this time, but Germans were the majority by the [[early modern period]]. During the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries, the town expanded economically, spatially, and demographically, in spite of local conflicts and the turbulent [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].\n\nAfter the victory of King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[Silesian Wars|First Silesian War]] (1740\u20131742), Schwiebus came under [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] administration. In 1817 its territory was merged with the southern Z\u00fcllichau region to form the Z\u00fcllichau-Schwiebus District in the [[Province of Brandenburg]]. Schwiebus remained in this territorial form until 1945. Annexation by Prussia brought about a sharp economic crisis, as the tradesmen of Schwiebus were cut off from many of their traditional markets and outlets. The Prussian authorities also increased local taxes while limiting the town's autonomy. The period of revolutions and [[Napoleonic wars]] brought about a depression in the cloth trade and limited the economic prospects of the town.\n\nThe town's extended stagnation ended with the [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Stein]]-[[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] economic reforms and the beginning of the [[industrial revolution]] in the mid-19th century. As a medium-sized town and hub of the local market, lying at the intersection of several routes of communication, including the new [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]-[[Pozna\u0144]] railway line, Schwiebus became a center of local industry (textile, machinery, and agricultural food processing). The town was modernized at this time with improved traffic arteries, renovation of the town hall, reconstruction of the church of St. Michael, and the construction of several new public service buildings (law courts, high school, gas works, and post office). Schwiebus contributed to and benefited from the economic expansion of the [[German Empire]] in the years before 1914.\n\n===20th century===\n{{multiple image|align = right|perrow = 2|total_width=350\n| image1 = \u015awiebodzin, ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 par. pw \u015bw.

In the [[interwar period]], Schwiebus found itself in the eastern outskirts of Germany, twenty kilometers west of the newly imposed German-Polish border. During the 1920s, [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] experienced two major economic crises, the [[hyperinflation]] of the early 1920s and the [[Great Depression]] beginning in 1929. The citizens of Schwiebus suffered severe economic hardship during this time. As was the case elsewhere in Germany, many of the town's citizens were dissatisfied with their lot and turned to political extremism.\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]] of the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933. Hitler quickly moved to consolidate and expand his power, adopting severe repressive measures against his political opposition and the German [[Jew]]ish minority. However, Hitler remained popular with the public because he oversaw the German economic recovery of the 1930s. The new government sponsored many public works programs and a massive rearmament campaign which included the construction of an extensive fortified line of bunkers, ''Ostwall'' (today known as the [[Mi\u0119dzyrzecz Fortified Region]]) twenty kilometers north of Schwiebus.\n\n[[World War II]] (1939\u201345) first brought hardship to Schwiebus and then total disaster. In early January 1945, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] began its final advance through Poland into eastern Germany, reaching Schwiebus before the end of the month. By this time, many of its inhabitants had already fled, fearing the Soviet revenge for the atrocities perpetrated by the German occupation forces against the civilian population of the Soviet Union. The town was largely spared from destruction during the fighting, as the bulk of the Soviet forces passed to the north and south on their way to [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]]. It was finally captured in 31 January 1945. The capture was not without casualties.<ref>http://opty.info/nasze-forum/wspomnienia/tragiczne-losy-siostr-boromeuszek-za-swiebodzina/</ref>\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in the war, Schwiebus became \u015awiebodzin, and was once again part of Poland.\n\nThe new Polish government adopted the [[communism|communist economic system]] and enacted sweeping social, economic, and political reforms.  \u015awiebodzin's economic recovery was also hampered by the Soviet policy of dismantling industrial facilities in conquered areas, and shipping components back to the Soviet Union. In this way, \u015awiebodzin lost some of its prewar industries, particularly its breweries.\n\n\u015awiebodzin expanded in the period under communist rule, and its population doubled. New neighborhoods were built to the south of the railway line, composed largely of [[Plattenbau|pre-fabricated apartment buildings]]. The Communist Economic Planning Commissions chose to develop the electromechanical, furniture, and timber industries in \u015awiebodzin. Products were exported throughout Poland and to the other states in the [[Soviet Bloc]].\n\nHowever, with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the [[revolutions of 1989]], \u015awiebodzin once again experienced economic upheaval. With some difficulties, the local economy was adapted to the international [[market economy]]. New industries and businesses were established, but others were unable to compete in the new environment and went bankrupt. Many more goods became available in local shops, but at prices that many inhabitants could not afford. In recent years, a few foreign-owned discount supermarkets, pizzerias, hotels, and other businesses have been established in the town, taking advantage of the proximity of Poland's main east-west motorway. With the economic changes there have also been political changes. A series of non-communist local governments have been elected since 1989.\n\n==Attractions and sites of interest==\n[[File:Swiebodzin (9662661400).jpg|thumb|left|[[Facade]]s at the market square]]\n[[File:Christ the King Statue \u015awiebodzin 05.jpg|thumb|190px|Statue of ''[[Christ the King (\u015awiebodzin)|Christ the King]]'']]\nThe center of \u015awiebodzin still contains remnants of the town's past as a [[medieval]] walled settlement, including two nearly intact towers and fragments of the town\u2019s [[defensive walls]] and [[bastion]]s. The central [[market square]] is dominated by the [[town hall]], built around 1550 in the [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] style and rebuilt in the 19th century with the addition of its prominent [[clock tower]]. The town hall still contains its original [[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] in the rooms of the Regional Museum and basement cafe. There are two large churches in the town center, the Church of St. Michael the Archangel and the Church of the Mother of God. The Church of St. Michael was first built in the second half of the 15th Century, and its [[gothic revival architecture|neo-gothic]] [[fa\u00e7ade]] was added in the second half of the 19th century. The neo-gothic Church of the Mother of God was built during the [[Imperial Germany|Imperial German]] period as a [[Protestant Church]] but was reconsecrated as a [[Catholic Church]] after World War II.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, assembly of the ''[[Christ the King (\u015awiebodzin)|Christ the King]]'', a giant statue of a crowned [[Jesus Christ]], began on a hill on the outskirts of the town.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and an awareness that there would be much new cultural work being produced which had been inspired by the events.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available, equally, financial stimulus from governments, and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and an awareness that there would be much new cultural work being produced which had been inspired by the events.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available, equally, financial stimulus from governments, and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic.
