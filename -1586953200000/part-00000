The company, which was founded in 2005, is headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]] and also has offices in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], China, [[Uttar Pradesh]], India and [[Barcelona]], Spain.\n\n==Company==\n\nTVU Networks offers IP-based solutions for live broadcast. Its solutions are deployed across a variety of industries including news broadcast, web streaming, law enforcement, sports and government. TVU Networks\u2019 products have been used to cover a number of events around the world including the Royal Wedding, the World Cup, the London Summer Olympics and Sochi Winter Olympics, and U.S. presidential elections.\n\n==History==\n\nThe original flagship product of TVU Networks was TVUPlayer. TVUPlayer was [[freeware]] [[IPTV]] software application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] to watch several dozen TV channels over the Internet. TVU did not broadcast these channels, but provided a platform for broadcasters to distribute content online. It was the responsibility of the individual who broadcasts a particular channel on TVU to keep the channel running and ensure that the content can be legally transmitted. It was unknown to the viewer who the broadcaster was. Broadcasts originated from either a large broadcasting company itself, which chose to provide viewers with its broadcast, or individual broadcasters who created their own content or captured public broadcasts and rebroadcast them on TVU.\n\nIt was debated whether TVU Networks operated an illegal service by  knowingly providing users with an opportunity to watch copyrighted content without the permission of content owners. However, the company did not provide the illegal content itself due the fact that was the responsibility of the user who provided the content to verify its legality.<ref name=\"cnet1\">{{Cite news |url= http://news.cnet.com/TVU+Networks+exec+grapples+with+copyright+questions/2100-1026_3-6132672.html |title= TVU chief grapples with copyright questions |work= CNET News |accessdate= November 27, 2013 |author= Greg Sandoval |date= November 6, 2006 |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130119174026/http://news.cnet.com/TVU-Networks-exec-grapples-with-copyright-questions/2100-1026_3-6132672.html |archivedate= January 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref>\n\nTVU Networks shut down service to the TVUPlayer on February 25, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |title= TVU Networks shut down service to the TVU Player on February 25, 2013. |work= Company web site |url= http://www.tvunetworks.com/faq.html |accessdate= November 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015357/http://www.tvunetworks.com/faq.html |archivedate= December 3, 2013 |df=  }}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\n===TVU Alert===\n\nTVU Alert is a cloud-based service that allows users to instantly notify their entire organization or part of their organization about important information.\n\n===TVU Anywhere===\n\nTVU Anywhere is an app that turns mobile devices or laptops into transmitters that use aggregated cellular and WiFi connections to stream high-quality video.\n\n===TVU AP ENPS Integration===\n\nTVU AP ENPS Integration is a collaboration between TVU Networks and the Associated Press to create a newsroom workflow geared toward streamlining the newsgathering process from shooting to editing.\n\n===TVU Aerial Newsgathering Pack===\nThe TVU Aerial Newsgathering Pack integrates its TVU One mobile transmitter with drone technology to enable live high-definition transmission from in the air.\n\n===TVU Booking Service===\nTVU Booking Service lets stations plan and manage streams.

''Finn'' (or variants, such as {{lang|non|skridfinn}}, 'striding Finn') was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the S\u00e1mi, as attested in the Icelandic [[Eddas]] and [[Norse sagas]] (11th to 14th centuries). The etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|finna}}, from proto-Germanic {{lang|gem|*finthanan}} ('to find'),<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |year= |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=find&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref> the logic being that the S\u00e1mi, as [[hunter-gatherers]] \"found\" their food, rather than grew it. As Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using ''Finn'' to refer to inhabitants of what is now Finland, while the S\u00e1mi came to be called ''Lapps''. In Norway, however, S\u00e1mi were still called ''Finns'' at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like {{lang|no|[[Finnmark]]}}, {{lang|no|[[Finnsnes]]}}, {{lang|no|Finnfjord}} and {{lang|no|Finn\u00f8y}}), and some northern Norwegians will still occasionally use ''Finn'' to refer to S\u00e1mi people, although the S\u00e1mi themselves now consider this to be an inappropriate term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as [[Kven people|Kvens]] to distinguish them from the S\u00e1mi \"Finns\".

Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sami cultural element was strengthened, since the Sami were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the pressure of [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]] of the Sami increased, with some Sami adopting [[Laestadianism]]. With the introduction of seven compulsory years of school in 1889, the Sami language and traditional way of life came increasingly under pressure from forced cultural normalization. Sami people were occasionally subjected to eugenics through forced sterilization from 1934, during the reign of the social democrat [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status.\n\nOn the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the Sami language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the Sami. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves, and sterilized Sami women. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/sami-west.htm |title=The Sami vs. Outsiders |last= Woodard |first=K\u00e1re (Kimmi) |website=[[University of Texas]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sami culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]] had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This caused the [[dislocation of Sami people]] in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sami groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on \"native act land\" to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the [[scorched earth]] policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy [[Lapland War|war destruction]] in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses, or ''kota'', and visible traces of Sami culture. After [[World War II]], the pressure was relaxed, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house Sami people were allowed to build. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe [[Alta controversy|controversy]] over the construction of the hydro-electric power station in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in 1979 brought Sami rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (\"[[S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla]]\") and flag ([[Sami flag]]) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the [[Finnmark Act]] was passed in the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] giving the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.\n\n====Contemporary====\nThe indigenous S\u00e1mi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic.

The failure to protect indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Violations of the rights of indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities, (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n[[File:Chibini massif and lake imandra.jpg|left|thumb|Chibini massif, [[Kola Peninsula]]]]\n\nThe life ways and economy of indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps.

S\u00e1mi are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of indigenous peoples leads to \"criminalization\" of local indigenous populations who cannot survive without \"poaching\" resources that should be accessible to them legally.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\nAlthough indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of indigenous group rights to ownership of land.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\n====Nordic====\nOn 16 November 2005 in [[Helsinki]], a group of experts, led by former [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway]] Professor [[Carsten Smith]], submitted a proposal for a Nordic S\u00e1mi Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for S\u00e1mi affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three S\u00e1mi Parliaments from the respective countries.

Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled [[scrimshaw]]ed [[sami knife|sami knives]], [[sami drum|drums]], and [[guksi]] (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as [[g\u00e1kti]] (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.\n\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|G\u00e1kti}}\n{{See also|Four Winds hat|Beaska|Luhkka}}\n[[File:Sami clothing 3.JPG|thumb|S\u00e1mi hats]]\nGakti are the traditional clothing worn by the S\u00e1mi people. The g\u00e1kti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.\n\nTraditionally, the g\u00e1kti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's g\u00e1kti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1\u20133 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Boots can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern S\u00e1mi boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different g\u00e1kti for women and men; men's g\u00e1kti have a shorter \"jacket-skirt\" than a women's long dress. Traditional g\u00e1kti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.\n\nThe colours, patterns and the jewellery of the g\u00e1kti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqu\u00e9s in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern S\u00e1mi have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by sex, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sapmi.\n\nThe g\u00e1kti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern S\u00e1mi also have a hooded jumper (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.\n\n===Media and literature===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi media}}\n[[File:Johan Turi, Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra.jpg|thumb|''Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra'' by [[Johan Turi]]]]\n* There are short daily news bulletins in Northern S\u00e1mi on national TV in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].

Yoiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung ''[[a cappella]]'', usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Yoiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany yoiks. The only traditional S\u00e1mi instruments that were sometimes used to accompany yoik are the \"fadno\" flute (made from reed-like ''[[Garden Angelica|Angelica archangelica]]'' stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).\n\n===Education===\n* Education with S\u00e1mi as the first language is available in all four countries, and also outside the S\u00e1mi area.\n* [[S\u00e1mi University College]] is located in Kautokeino.

The larger part of S\u00e1pmi is not covered by the term \"Lapland\". ''Lapland'' can be either misleading or offensive, or both, depending on the context and where this word is used, to the Sami.

S\u00e1mi languages, and S\u00e1mi song-chants, called yoiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to S\u00e1mi instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the S\u00e1mi into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, S\u00e1mi children were taken away when aged 1\u20132 and returned when aged 15\u201317 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all S\u00e1mi viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking S\u00e1mi has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Survivance in Sami and First Nations Boarding School Narratives |last=Kuokkanen |first=Rauna |year=2003 |publisher=[[American Indian Quarterly]] |volume=27 |pages=697\u2013726}}</ref>\n\nThe S\u00e1mi languages belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, linguistically related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

The majority of the S\u00e1mi now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of S\u00e1mi languages among S\u00e1mi and persons of S\u00e1mi origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists.

In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the indigenous Sami people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians, whose mission is to work for the Sami people and culture. Candidates' election promises often get into conflict with the institutions' submission under their governments, but as authorities, they have some influence over the government.\n\n===Norwegian organizations===\nThe main organisations for Sami representation in Norway are the ''siidas''. They cover northern and central Norway.\n\n===Swedish organizations===\nThe main organisations for Sami representation in Sweden are the ''siidas''. They cover northern and central Sweden.\n\n===Finnish organizations===\nIn contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a ''siida'' (''paliskunta'' in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 |title=FINLEX \u00ae \u2013 Ajantasainen lains\u00e4\u00e4d\u00e4nt\u00f6: 14.9.1990/848 |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> i.e., the [[European Union]] and Norway, [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], are allowed to join a ''paliskunta''.\n\n===Russian organizations===\nIn 2010, the Sami Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the Nordic countries, with particular focus on indigenous peoples and minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senterfornordligefolk.no/frontpage.146031.en.html|title=Frontpage \u2013 Senter for Nordlige Folk AS|publisher = senterfornordligefolk.no}}</ref>\n\n===Border conflicts===\n[[File:Glen1 Sweden.jpg|thumb|Land rights for grazing [[reindeer]]]]\nS\u00e1pmi, the Sami traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]]. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern S\u00e1pmi but areas that are beyond today's S\u00e1pmi that reflect older territories. Today's \"borders\" originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sami groups themselves and more southern immigrants.\n\nOwning land within the borders or being a member of a ''[[siida]]'' (Sami corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with skepticism and anger amongst the ''siidas''.\n\nCourt proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sami viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one ''siida'' has introduced a sponsorship \"Reindeer Godfather\" concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These \"internal conflicts\" are usually conflicts between non-Sami land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sami ancient rights to reindeer pastures. In 2010, Sweden was criticized for its relations with the Sami in the Universal Periodic Review conducted by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council.<ref name=\"lib.ohchr.org\">{{cite report |title=Draft report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review |date=May 14, 2010 |publisher=[[Universal Periodic Review|The Working Group on the UPR]] |location=Geneva |url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session8/SE/A_HRC_WG.6_8_L.10_Sweden.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe question whether the [[fjeld]]'s territory is owned by the governments (crown land) or by the Sami population is not answered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFrom an indigenous perspective, people \"belong to the land\", the land does not belong to people, but this does not mean that hunters, herders, and fishing people do not know where the borders of their territories are located as well as those of their neighbors.<ref name=\"Osherenko\"/>\n\n==National symbols==\nAlthough the Sami have considered themselves to be one people throughout history, the idea of S\u00e1pmi, a Sami [[nation]], first gained acceptance among the Sami in the 1970s, and even later among the majority population. During the 1980s and 1990s, a flag was created, a national song was written, and the date of a national day was settled.\n\n===Flag===\n{{Main|Sami flag}}\n[[File:Sami flag.svg|thumb|Sami flag]]\nThe Sami flag was inaugurated during the Sami Conference in [[\u00c5re]], Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist [[Astrid B\u00e5hl]] from [[Skibotn]], Norway.\n\nThe motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem \"Paiven parneh\" (\"Sons of the Sun\") by the South Sami [[Anders Fjellner]] describing the Sami as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sami colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).\n\n===The Sami People's Day===\n{{Main|Sami National Day}}\nThe Sami National Day falls on February 6 as this date was when the [[The Sami assembly of 1917|first Sami congress]] was held in 1917 in [[Trondheim]], Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sami came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sami congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized February 6 as Sami National Day.\n\n===\"Song of the Sami People\"===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla}}\n\"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" (\"Song of the Sami People\", lit. \"Song of the Sami Family\") was originally a poem written by [[Isak Saba]] that was published in the newspaper ''[[Sagai Muittal\u00e6gje]]'' for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the [[national anthem]] of the Sami. Arne S\u00f8rli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sami Conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1992. \"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" has been translated into all of the [[Sami languages]].\n\n===Coats of Arms of Sami Communities===\n<gallery class=\"center\" perrow=\"12\" widths=\"50px\" heights=\"60px\" caption=\"Coats of Arms\">\nFile:Coat of arms of Finnmark county and Troms county.svg|[[Troms og Finnmark|Romsa ja Finnm\u00e1rku]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Nordland v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Nordland|Nordl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Tr\u00f8ndelag v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Tr\u00f8ndelag|Tr\u00f8ndel\u00e1ga]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Lappland vapen.svg|[[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Norrbottens vapen.svg|[[Norrbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:V\u00e4sterbottens vapen.svg|[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:J\u00e4mtlands vapen.svg|[[J\u00e4mtland|J\u00e4mtl\u00e1ndda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:H\u00e4rjedalens vapen.svg|[[H\u00e4rjedalen|H\u00e4rjedaelie]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Lapin maakunnan vaakuna.svg|[[Lapland (Finland)|Lappi]]<br/>(Finland)\nFile:\u0413\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438.svg|[[Murmansk Oblast|Murm\u00e1nska]]<br/>(Russia)\n</gallery>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Sami religion}}\n[[File:Shaman.jpg|thumb|Copper etching (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a [[noaidi]] with his meavrresg\u00e1rri [[drum]]]]\nWidespread [[Shamanism]] persisted among the Sami up until the 18th century.

There was some diversity due to the wide area that is [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]], allowing for the evolution of variations in beliefs and practices between tribes. The old beliefs are closely connected to the land, [[animism]], and the [[supernatural]].

Through a mainly French initiative from [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] as part of his [[La Recherche Expedition (1838\u20131840)|La Recherche Expedition]], [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius]] began research on Sami mythology. His work resulted in [[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]], since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed ''Theory of Gods'', ''Theory of Sacrifice'', ''Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic'' and ''Sami sagas''. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sami groups. The mythology has common elements with other traditional indigenous religions as well\u2014such as those in [[Siberia]] and North America.\n\n===Missionary efforts===\n[[File:Tore Johnsen, samiske kirkedager.JPG|thumb|A sermon at the 2004 ''Samiske kirkedager'']]\nThe term ''Sami religion'' usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most S\u00e1mi until approximately the 18th century. [[Christianity]] was introduced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and [[rune drum]]s were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sami practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sami were considered to possess \"witchcraft\" powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Witches of the high north: The Finnmark witchcraft trials in the seventeenth century |journal=Scandinavian Journal of History |volume=22 |issue=3 |last=Willumsen |first=L.H. |year=1997 |pages=199\u2013221| url=|doi=10.1080/03468759708579352 }}</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a major effort to convert the Sami was made around 1720, when [[Thomas von Westen]], the \"Apostle of the Sami\", burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people.<ref name=\"Holloway\">{{cite web|title=The Decline of the S\u00e1mi People's Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan \"Ivv\u00e1r\"|authorlink= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm}}</ref> Out of the estimated thousands of drums prior to this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe.<ref name=\"Gusto\"/> Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), \u00e1lda and s\u00e1ivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.\n\nIn the far east of the Sami area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sami in the 16th century.

This movement is still very dominant in Sami-speaking areas.

The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons \"filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand,&nbsp;... about a God who cared about the lives of the people\" had a profound positive effect on both problems.  One account from a Sami cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sami to learn to read and a \"bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness&nbsp;...

There are also some Sami who claim to be ''noaidi'' and offer their services through newspaper advertisements, in [[New Age]] arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan [[discrimination against Neopagans|prejudice]] has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. S\u00e1mi animism is manifested in the S\u00e1mi's belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs include a multitude of spirits.<ref name=\"Holloway\"/> Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of [[neo-paganism]], as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct indigenous Sami religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.\n\nIn 2012, County Governor of Troms approved Shamanic Association of Troms\u00f8 as a new religion.<ref>denominationhttp://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2792-shamanism-approved-as-a-religion-in-norway</ref>\n\nA very different religious idea is represented by the numerous \"wise men\" and \"wise women\" found throughout the Sami area. They often offer to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional elements, such as older Sami teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.\n\n==Genetic studies==\n{{Main|Population genetics of the Sami}}\n[[File:Lapland Mother NGM-v31-p556.jpg|thumb|left|Sami mother with her children]]\n[[Anthropologist]]s have been studying the Sami people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans.

''Finn'' (or variants, such as {{lang|non|skridfinn}}, 'striding Finn') was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the S\u00e1mi, as attested in the Icelandic [[Eddas]] and [[Norse sagas]] (11th to 14th centuries). The etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|finna}}, from proto-Germanic {{lang|gem|*finthanan}} ('to find'),<ref>{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary |year= |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=find&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref> the logic being that the S\u00e1mi, as [[hunter-gatherers]] \"found\" their food, rather than grew it. As Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using ''Finn'' to refer to inhabitants of what is now Finland, while the S\u00e1mi came to be called ''Lapps''. In Norway, however, S\u00e1mi were still called ''Finns'' at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like {{lang|no|[[Finnmark]]}}, {{lang|no|[[Finnsnes]]}}, {{lang|no|Finnfjord}} and {{lang|no|Finn\u00f8y}}), and some northern Norwegians will still occasionally use ''Finn'' to refer to S\u00e1mi people, although the S\u00e1mi themselves now consider this to be an inappropriate term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as [[Kven people|Kvens]] to distinguish them from the S\u00e1mi \"Finns\".

Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sami cultural element was strengthened, since the Sami were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the pressure of [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]] of the Sami increased, with some Sami adopting [[Laestadianism]]. With the introduction of seven compulsory years of school in 1889, the Sami language and traditional way of life came increasingly under pressure from forced cultural normalization. Sami people were occasionally subjected to eugenics through forced sterilization from 1934, during the reign of the social democrat [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status.\n\nOn the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the Sami language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the Sami. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves, and sterilized Sami women. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/dieda/hist/sami-west.htm |title=The Sami vs. Outsiders |last= Woodard |first=K\u00e1re (Kimmi) |website=[[University of Texas]] |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sami culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]] had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This caused the [[dislocation of Sami people]] in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sami groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on \"native act land\" to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the [[scorched earth]] policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy [[Lapland War|war destruction]] in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944\u201345, destroying all existing houses, or ''kota'', and visible traces of Sami culture. After [[World War II]], the pressure was relaxed, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house Sami people were allowed to build. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe [[Alta controversy|controversy]] over the construction of the hydro-electric power station in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in 1979 brought Sami rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (\"[[S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla]]\") and flag ([[Sami flag]]) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the [[Finnmark Act]] was passed in the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] giving the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.\n\n====Contemporary====\nThe indigenous S\u00e1mi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic.

The failure to protect indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Violations of the rights of indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities, (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n[[File:Chibini massif and lake imandra.jpg|left|thumb|Chibini massif, [[Kola Peninsula]]]]\n\nThe life ways and economy of indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps.

S\u00e1mi are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of indigenous peoples leads to \"criminalization\" of local indigenous populations who cannot survive without \"poaching\" resources that should be accessible to them legally.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\nAlthough indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of indigenous group rights to ownership of land.<ref name=\"Osherenko\" />\n\n====Nordic====\nOn 16 November 2005 in [[Helsinki]], a group of experts, led by former [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway]] Professor [[Carsten Smith]], submitted a proposal for a Nordic S\u00e1mi Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for S\u00e1mi affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three S\u00e1mi Parliaments from the respective countries.

Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled [[scrimshaw]]ed [[sami knife|sami knives]], [[sami drum|drums]], and [[guksi]] (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as [[g\u00e1kti]] (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.\n\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|G\u00e1kti}}\n{{See also|Four Winds hat|Beaska|Luhkka}}\n[[File:Sami clothing 3.JPG|thumb|S\u00e1mi hats]]\nGakti are the traditional clothing worn by the S\u00e1mi people. The g\u00e1kti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.\n\nTraditionally, the g\u00e1kti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's g\u00e1kti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1\u20133 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Boots can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern S\u00e1mi boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different g\u00e1kti for women and men; men's g\u00e1kti have a shorter \"jacket-skirt\" than a women's long dress. Traditional g\u00e1kti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.\n\nThe colours, patterns and the jewellery of the g\u00e1kti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqu\u00e9s in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern S\u00e1mi have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by sex, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sapmi.\n\nThe g\u00e1kti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern S\u00e1mi also have a hooded jumper (\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.\n\n===Media and literature===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi media}}\n[[File:Johan Turi, Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra.jpg|thumb|''Muitalus s\u00e1miid birra'' by [[Johan Turi]]]]\n* There are short daily news bulletins in Northern S\u00e1mi on national TV in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]].

Yoiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung ''[[a cappella]]'', usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Yoiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany yoiks. The only traditional S\u00e1mi instruments that were sometimes used to accompany yoik are the \"fadno\" flute (made from reed-like ''[[Garden Angelica|Angelica archangelica]]'' stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).\n\n===Education===\n* Education with S\u00e1mi as the first language is available in all four countries, and also outside the S\u00e1mi area.\n* [[S\u00e1mi University College]] is located in Kautokeino.

The larger part of S\u00e1pmi is not covered by the term \"Lapland\". ''Lapland'' can be either misleading or offensive, or both, depending on the context and where this word is used, to the Sami.

S\u00e1mi languages, and S\u00e1mi song-chants, called yoiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to S\u00e1mi instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the S\u00e1mi into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, S\u00e1mi children were taken away when aged 1\u20132 and returned when aged 15\u201317 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all S\u00e1mi viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking S\u00e1mi has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Survivance in Sami and First Nations Boarding School Narratives |last=Kuokkanen |first=Rauna |year=2003 |publisher=[[American Indian Quarterly]] |volume=27 |pages=697\u2013726}}</ref>\n\nThe S\u00e1mi languages belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, linguistically related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].

The majority of the S\u00e1mi now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of S\u00e1mi languages among S\u00e1mi and persons of S\u00e1mi origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists.

In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the indigenous Sami people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians, whose mission is to work for the Sami people and culture. Candidates' election promises often get into conflict with the institutions' submission under their governments, but as authorities, they have some influence over the government.\n\n===Norwegian organizations===\nThe main organisations for Sami representation in Norway are the ''siidas''. They cover northern and central Norway.\n\n===Swedish organizations===\nThe main organisations for Sami representation in Sweden are the ''siidas''. They cover northern and central Sweden.\n\n===Finnish organizations===\nIn contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a ''siida'' (''paliskunta'' in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 |title=FINLEX \u00ae \u2013 Ajantasainen lains\u00e4\u00e4d\u00e4nt\u00f6: 14.9.1990/848 |publisher=Finlex.fi |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> i.e., the [[European Union]] and Norway, [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], are allowed to join a ''paliskunta''.\n\n===Russian organizations===\nIn 2010, the Sami Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the Nordic countries, with particular focus on indigenous peoples and minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senterfornordligefolk.no/frontpage.146031.en.html|title=Frontpage \u2013 Senter for Nordlige Folk AS|publisher = senterfornordligefolk.no}}</ref>\n\n===Border conflicts===\n[[File:Glen1 Sweden.jpg|thumb|Land rights for grazing [[reindeer]]]]\nS\u00e1pmi, the Sami traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]]. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern S\u00e1pmi but areas that are beyond today's S\u00e1pmi that reflect older territories. Today's \"borders\" originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sami groups themselves and more southern immigrants.\n\nOwning land within the borders or being a member of a ''[[siida]]'' (Sami corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with skepticism and anger amongst the ''siidas''.\n\nCourt proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sami viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one ''siida'' has introduced a sponsorship \"Reindeer Godfather\" concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These \"internal conflicts\" are usually conflicts between non-Sami land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sami ancient rights to reindeer pastures. In 2010, Sweden was criticized for its relations with the Sami in the Universal Periodic Review conducted by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council.<ref name=\"lib.ohchr.org\">{{cite report |title=Draft report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review |date=May 14, 2010 |publisher=[[Universal Periodic Review|The Working Group on the UPR]] |location=Geneva |url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session8/SE/A_HRC_WG.6_8_L.10_Sweden.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe question whether the [[fjeld]]'s territory is owned by the governments (crown land) or by the Sami population is not answered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFrom an indigenous perspective, people \"belong to the land\", the land does not belong to people, but this does not mean that hunters, herders, and fishing people do not know where the borders of their territories are located as well as those of their neighbors.<ref name=\"Osherenko\"/>\n\n==National symbols==\nAlthough the Sami have considered themselves to be one people throughout history, the idea of S\u00e1pmi, a Sami [[nation]], first gained acceptance among the Sami in the 1970s, and even later among the majority population. During the 1980s and 1990s, a flag was created, a national song was written, and the date of a national day was settled.\n\n===Flag===\n{{Main|Sami flag}}\n[[File:Sami flag.svg|thumb|Sami flag]]\nThe Sami flag was inaugurated during the Sami Conference in [[\u00c5re]], Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist [[Astrid B\u00e5hl]] from [[Skibotn]], Norway.\n\nThe motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem \"Paiven parneh\" (\"Sons of the Sun\") by the South Sami [[Anders Fjellner]] describing the Sami as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sami colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).\n\n===The Sami People's Day===\n{{Main|Sami National Day}}\nThe Sami National Day falls on February 6 as this date was when the [[The Sami assembly of 1917|first Sami congress]] was held in 1917 in [[Trondheim]], Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sami came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sami congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized February 6 as Sami National Day.\n\n===\"Song of the Sami People\"===\n{{Main|S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla}}\n\"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" (\"Song of the Sami People\", lit. \"Song of the Sami Family\") was originally a poem written by [[Isak Saba]] that was published in the newspaper ''[[Sagai Muittal\u00e6gje]]'' for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the [[national anthem]] of the Sami. Arne S\u00f8rli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sami Conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1992. \"S\u00e1mi soga l\u00e1vlla\" has been translated into all of the [[Sami languages]].\n\n===Coats of Arms of Sami Communities===\n<gallery class=\"center\" perrow=\"12\" widths=\"50px\" heights=\"60px\" caption=\"Coats of Arms\">\nFile:Coat of arms of Finnmark county and Troms county.svg|[[Troms og Finnmark|Romsa ja Finnm\u00e1rku]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Nordland v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Nordland|Nordl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Tr\u00f8ndelag v\u00e5pen.svg|[[Tr\u00f8ndelag|Tr\u00f8ndel\u00e1ga]]<br/>(Norway)\nFile:Lappland vapen.svg|[[Lapland (Sweden)|Lappl\u00e1nda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Norrbottens vapen.svg|[[Norrbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:V\u00e4sterbottens vapen.svg|[[V\u00e4sterbotten]]a<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:J\u00e4mtlands vapen.svg|[[J\u00e4mtland|J\u00e4mtl\u00e1ndda]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:H\u00e4rjedalens vapen.svg|[[H\u00e4rjedalen|H\u00e4rjedaelie]]<br/>(Sweden)\nFile:Lapin maakunnan vaakuna.svg|[[Lapland (Finland)|Lappi]]<br/>(Finland)\nFile:\u0413\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438.svg|[[Murmansk Oblast|Murm\u00e1nska]]<br/>(Russia)\n</gallery>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Sami religion}}\n[[File:Shaman.jpg|thumb|Copper etching (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a [[noaidi]] with his meavrresg\u00e1rri [[drum]]]]\nWidespread [[Shamanism]] persisted among the Sami up until the 18th century.

There was some diversity due to the wide area that is [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|S\u00e1pmi]], allowing for the evolution of variations in beliefs and practices between tribes. The old beliefs are closely connected to the land, [[animism]], and the [[supernatural]].

Through a mainly French initiative from [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] as part of his [[La Recherche Expedition (1838\u20131840)|La Recherche Expedition]], [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius]] began research on Sami mythology. His work resulted in [[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]], since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed ''Theory of Gods'', ''Theory of Sacrifice'', ''Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic'' and ''Sami sagas''. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sami groups. The mythology has common elements with other traditional indigenous religions as well\u2014such as those in [[Siberia]] and North America.\n\n===Missionary efforts===\n[[File:Tore Johnsen, samiske kirkedager.JPG|thumb|A sermon at the 2004 ''Samiske kirkedager'']]\nThe term ''Sami religion'' usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most S\u00e1mi until approximately the 18th century. [[Christianity]] was introduced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and [[rune drum]]s were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sami practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sami were considered to possess \"witchcraft\" powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Witches of the high north: The Finnmark witchcraft trials in the seventeenth century |journal=Scandinavian Journal of History |volume=22 |issue=3 |last=Willumsen |first=L.H. |year=1997 |pages=199\u2013221| url=|doi=10.1080/03468759708579352 }}</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a major effort to convert the Sami was made around 1720, when [[Thomas von Westen]], the \"Apostle of the Sami\", burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people.<ref name=\"Holloway\">{{cite web|title=The Decline of the S\u00e1mi People's Indigenous Religion |last= Holloway|first= Alan \"Ivv\u00e1r\"|authorlink= |year= |publisher= TexasU|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm}}</ref> Out of the estimated thousands of drums prior to this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe.<ref name=\"Gusto\"/> Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), \u00e1lda and s\u00e1ivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.\n\nIn the far east of the Sami area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sami in the 16th century.

This movement is still very dominant in Sami-speaking areas.

The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons \"filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sami that they could understand,&nbsp;... about a God who cared about the lives of the people\" had a profound positive effect on both problems.  One account from a Sami cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sami to learn to read and a \"bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness&nbsp;...

There are also some Sami who claim to be ''noaidi'' and offer their services through newspaper advertisements, in [[New Age]] arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan [[discrimination against Neopagans|prejudice]] has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. S\u00e1mi animism is manifested in the S\u00e1mi's belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional S\u00e1mi beliefs include a multitude of spirits.<ref name=\"Holloway\"/> Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of [[neo-paganism]], as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct indigenous Sami religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.\n\nIn 2012, County Governor of Troms approved Shamanic Association of Troms\u00f8 as a new religion.<ref>denominationhttp://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2792-shamanism-approved-as-a-religion-in-norway</ref>\n\nA very different religious idea is represented by the numerous \"wise men\" and \"wise women\" found throughout the Sami area. They often offer to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional elements, such as older Sami teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.\n\n==Genetic studies==\n{{Main|Population genetics of the Sami}}\n[[File:Lapland Mother NGM-v31-p556.jpg|thumb|left|Sami mother with her children]]\n[[Anthropologist]]s have been studying the Sami people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans.

He also edited and published compilations of his work, which greatly influenced [[visual artist]]s and the developing fields of scientific and industrial photography. He returned to his native England permanently in 1894. In 1904, [[Kingston Museum]] was opened in his hometown and continues to house a collection of his works to this day in a dedicated 'Muybridge Exhibition'. \n\n== Names ==\nEdward James Muggeridge was born and raised in England.

From 1855 to 1865, he mainly used the surname \"Muygridge\".{{sfn|Solnit|2003|p=7|ps=}}\n\nFrom 1865 onward, he used the surname \"Muybridge\". \n\nIn addition, he used the [[pseudonym]] ''[[Helios]]'' (Titan of the sun) for his early photography.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns.

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860. On 13 March 1882 he lectured at the [[Royal Institution]] in London in front of a sell-out audience, which included members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], notably the future [[King Edward VII]].<ref name=BCLG>Brian Clegg [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309101127/page/n172 <!-- pg=159 quote=King Edward - eadweard muybridge. --> ''The Man Who Stopped Time: The Illuminating Story of Eadweard Muybridge : Pioneer Photographer, Father of the Motion Picture, Murderer''], Joseph Henry Press, 2007</ref> He displayed his photographs on screen and showed moving pictures projected by his zoopraxiscope.<ref name=BCLG/>\n\nMuybridge and Stanford had a major falling-out concerning his research on equine locomotion.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, \"Here's the answer to the letter you sent my wife\", and shot him [[point-blank]].

The opening of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, and the development of [[steamship]]s made travel much faster and less arduous than it was in 1860.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject.

At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition.
