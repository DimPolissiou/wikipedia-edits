He preached in the tenth and eleventh centuries [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries AD). His adherents call themselves Qadri Naushahi, Naushahi or just Qadri (Qadiri).\n\n== Birth and names ==\n\nSyed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was born on the first day of Ramadan in 959 AH (21 August 1552) at Ghogganwali, district Gujrat in Punjab, Pakistan. The name of his father was Ala\u2019uddin, who was respected for being a great Sufi of his own times. Despite all difficulties of undertaking a long journey in his days he had completed his pilgrimage to Mecca Mukarramah and Madinah Munawwarah seven times on foot, which shows how devoted to Islam he was.\n\nAt his birth he was named (Haji) Muhammad. This name was kept in accordance with some divine and supernatural messages. In the first instance he became famous by the name of Haji Muhammad. Later on he also became famous by the names of Haji Nausha, Abul Hashim, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Islam (the great revival of the Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Syed Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. The name Naushah is also spelled and pronounced as Noshah or even Nosho.\n\nAt his birth he was named Muhammad. Later on he also adopted the names Haji Naushah (Nosh\u0101h), Abul Hashim, Hazrat Naush\u0101h Wal\u012b, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Azam (the great reviver of Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Sayyid Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. He claimed to have received the titles \"Ganj Bakhsh\" and \"Naushah\" in the presence of God. Both names are Persian words; Ganj Bakhsh means \"bestower of hidden treasures\" and Naushah means a young king or a bridegroom. He was also known as Maq\u0101m-i Naush\u0101hat.\n\n===Forebearers===\nMuhammad Qadri was a [[Sayyid]] (direct descendant of the family of [[Muhammad]]), a 33nd{{Clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Should this be '32nd', '33rd' or something else?}}-generation scion of [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]].It has been recorded that the first of the ancestors of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri, who came to the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, was Syed Awn ibn Ya\u2018la, well known by the name of Qutb Shah Qadri. This happened by order of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani in the fifth century AH (about the eleventh century AD). Moreover, he was an uncle of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani and one of his spiritual successors born in 1028 in Baghdad. He is also the first person who introduced the Qadiria Order in India. Qutb Shah Qadiri was an appointed Qutb (spiritual pole) by Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani for this Indian subcontinent. Due to his great efforts many of the Hindu tribes converted to the Islam. Among them are the tribes of Rajput, Chohan and Khokar. Most of them attained a blessed life in the religion. Qutb Shah Qadiri returned after his mission, that he did for many years, to Baghdad where he died in 1157. In this city you can also find his holy grave.\n\nThe son and the spiritual successor of Qutb Shah Qadiri was Syed Zaman Ali Muhsin. He spread the Islam in the southwest regions of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, Kohistan-i Namak and the surroundings of Saunsakesar. Many people converted due to him to the Islam and joined in his circle of Murids (spiritual disciples). His work for the religion even impressed the local ruler \"Rani Bharat\", who later accepted the Islam as the true religion. The holy grave of Syed Zaman Ali Shah is located in Kirana, district Sargodha in Pakistan.\n\nSyed Mahmud Shah, better known as Pir Jalib, is one of the descendants of Syed Zaman Ali Shah. He was an outstanding saint who possessed super natural gifts, called Tasarrufat. He was also called Pir Jalib, because of his numerous benefactions and his spiritual attraction. Like his forefathers he was a spiritual perfected person. His holy burial place is in Ramdiana, district Sargodha. Syed Shamsuddin Shahid was a great saint from the descendants of Pir Jalib. He always took with him his favourite weapon, a javelin. Hence he was called Sangin Shah Shahid. He became a martyr when he died during a battle in the way of Allah. Sangin Shah had two sons: Syed Ala\u2019uddin Husain and Syed Rahimuddin. The holy graves of both the brothers are situated in Ghogganwali, near Qadirabad in the district Gujrat, Pakistan.\n\nSyed Ala\u2019uddin is reckoned among the great spiritual masters of the mystical path.

He was highly gifted with the qualities of intelligence and memory. The books of religious history of his times tell us that he memorised the holy Qur'an within a short period of three months only. Among his teachers in this world were Qari Qaimuddin and Shaikh Abdul Haqq.\n\nHe was widely respected and honoured for his knowledge of Tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism), because his inner experience helped him to demonstrate his superiority in his field. Actually the knowledge infinitive mysticism came to him from Allah directly (Ilm-i Ladunni). Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori records that one night two angels came and placed their fingers into the mouth of Syed Nausha. All of a sudden he became a learned and knowledgeable man in the field of Islamic mysticism. The next morning he told his teacher about this extraordinary spiritual experience. The teacher remarked: \"There is no need for you to get further knowledge from me. Perhaps on the Day of Judgement I shall be rewarded with salvation of my soul for having given a few lessons to you before this glorious spiritual experience.\"\n\nSyed Naushah Pir was an expert in the religious field, like Fiqh (Islamic law), Hadith (the report of the practise and sayings of the Prophet), Tafsir (exegeses of the Qur'an), logics, philosophy and Kalam (theology concerning the tenets of belief). His comprehensive knowledge of the religion is evident from his sayings.\n\nBeside the important languages such as Arabic and Persian he knew Kashmiri, Sanskrit and many another regional languages as well. After having Islamic knowledge, he specialized himself in spiritual exercises.\n\n== Golden Chain ==\nAt the age of twenty-nine years Muhammad accepted Hazrat Sakhi Shah Suleman Noori Hazoori (From Bhalwal Sharif) as his spiritual guide, placing him in a [[silsila]] (spiritual order or chain of saints) that stretched back to Abdul Qadir Jilani.

His mother, Main J\u012bwn\u012b, arranged this marriage. He had two sons and one daughter. Their names were Sayyid Muhammad Barkhurdar, Sayyid Muhammad Hashim and Sayyida Sairah Khatoon.\n\nHe was noted for his hospitality. Mirza Ahmed Beg Lahori states that he looked after his guests personally and arranged for their food himself. Allama Jam\u0101lullah says that once he and some of his pupils stayed in Sayyid Naushah's mosque. They were highly impressed when he sent food for them from his own house. It is on record that he directed his sons to look after the guests with special care, when he entrusted the work of preaching Islam to them.\n\nHe took part in many battles. It is recorded that once a renowned wrestler named Sher Ali Khan challenged Haji Muhammad to a trial of strength. Muhammad pressed Khan's hand so powerfully that blood came out of the wrestler's fingers. The wrestler fell down at his feet and begged to be forgiven.\n\nHe usually spent his time in the mosque in teaching the holy Qur'an, leading the prayers five times a day and leading additional Nafl prayers by the riverside in the night.\n\nHaji Muhammad attempted to put the [[Sunnah]] in practice as precisely as possible. He said: <blockquote>\"My way of life is the Shar\u012b'ah of the Prophet. My way of the Tar\u012bqah is the Shar\u012b'ah of the Prophet. The way of life of the Prophet implies also my way of life. To walk through the Shar\u012b'ah is like walking on an illuminated way.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}</blockquote>\n\nBy day Muhammad always wore a big woollen sheet, as prescribed by the Sunnah. This piece of cloth is named bhoora in the Punjabi language, hence he was also called Bhoorawala Pir. Today, followers of his order also wear the bhoora.\n\n== Literary works ==\nThere are many works of Sayyid Naush\u0101h Ganj Bakhsh. As time passes they are compiled and published from manuscripts. At present there are five books of poetry and prose:\n*''Kulliy\u0101t-i Naush\u0101h'': ([[Urdu]] poetry) consisting of 76 Risala's and 2400 verses.\n*''Kulliy\u0101t-i Naush\u0101h'': ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] poetry) In this work 126 Risala's of about four thousand verses are alphabetically arranged.\n*''Ma\u2018\u0101rif-i Tasawwuf'': ([[Persian language|Persian]] poetry) dealing with assignments on the spiritual path.\n*''Maw\u0101'iz-i Naush\u0101h P\u012br'': (Punjabi prose) comprises delivered speeches and advices.\n*''Ganj-ul-Asr\u0101r'' (\"the treasure of mysteries\"): a short Risala in prose ascribed to him.\n\nAccording to Professor Ahmed Qureshi the following books are also written by Sayyid Naushah Pir: ''Diwan Urdu'', ''Diwan Punjabi'' (two poems in respectively Urdu and Punjabi) and ''Mathnawi-ye Ganj'' (\"The Mathnawi of Naushah Ganj Bakhsh\").\n\n==Quotations==\n\n\"O friend, withdraw yourself from the world.\"<br />\n\"If you don't, you have once to do that.\"<br />\n\"Don't spoil your time of life.\"<br />\n\"Leave the fame of the world behind you.\"<br />\n\"O my true friend, follow your Murshid (guide).\"<br />\n\"Do this in sincere surrendering in the heart with belief.\"<br />\n\"Commemorate the Kalima, so that you will not lose it.\"<br />\n\"The sufferings of this world and the last moment [death].\"<br />\n\"You can only prevail by this!\"\n\n== Death ==\nHaji Muhammad died of natural causes on Monday, the fifteenth of the Islamic month Rab\u012b 'ul-Awwal 1064 AH, aged one hundred and five. This date corresponds to Monday the eighteenth May 1654 A.D. He was buried in the village named Naushehra in Gujrat. His body was later interred at Ranmal Sharif in [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]]. His grave is open to the public. The part of land on which his grave has been buried, belongs to the territory of Ranmal Sharif. The number of plot was formerly 220 and at the present 84/1.\n\nDue to flooding in 1757 his body was transferred from its original burial site. According to tradition, when his coffin surfaced, his body was entirely intact, even his shroud was unharmed. After being damaged again by the river Chenab his coffin was finally moved to the west of Sahanpal Sharif. In 1950 this new tomb was damaged by rain. Consequently, the supports subsided and cracks appeared in the tomb. His death anniversary ('Urs) is held at this place every year again. Urs starts on 2nd Thursday of Har (Bikrami Calendar), which falls in the last 10 days of June and usually lasts 3 days. Thursday and Friday for men and Saturday for women.\n\n== Successors==\n\nA number of his sons and disciples carried his spiritual succession. In consequence, the Q\u0101dir\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b Order now includes many sub-branches carrying the name of his successors, such as Barkhurd\u0101r\u012b Naushah\u012b, H\u0101shim\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b, Suchy\u0101r\u012b Naush\u0101h\u012b and Noushahi PAK REHMANI.

He preached in the tenth and eleventh centuries [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries AD). His adherents call themselves Qadri Naushahi, Naushahi or just Qadri (Qadiri).\n\n== Birth and names ==\n\nSyed Muhammad Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri was born on the first day of Ramadan in 959 AH (21 August 1552) at Ghogganwali, district Gujrat in Punjab, Pakistan. The name of his father was Ala\u2019uddin, who was respected for being a great Sufi of his own times. Despite all difficulties of undertaking a long journey in his days he had completed his pilgrimage to Mecca Mukarramah and Madinah Munawwarah seven times on foot, which shows how devoted to Islam he was.\n\nAt his birth he was named (Haji) Muhammad. This name was kept in accordance with some divine and supernatural messages. In the first instance he became famous by the name of Haji Muhammad. Later on he also became famous by the names of Haji Nausha, Abul Hashim, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Islam (the great revival of the Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Syed Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. The name Naushah is also spelled and pronounced as Noshah or even Nosho.\n\nAt his birth he was named Muhammad. Later on he also adopted the names Haji Naushah (Nosh\u0101h), Abul Hashim, Hazrat Naush\u0101h Wal\u012b, Bhoora Wala Pir (the enshrouded one), Mujaddid-i Azam (the great reviver of Islam), Naushah Ganj Bakhsh, Sayyid Naushah Pir and Naushah Pak. He claimed to have received the titles \"Ganj Bakhsh\" and \"Naushah\" in the presence of God. Both names are Persian words; Ganj Bakhsh means \"bestower of hidden treasures\" and Naushah means a young king or a bridegroom. He was also known as Maq\u0101m-i Naush\u0101hat.\n\n===Forebearers===\nMuhammad Qadri was a [[Sayyid]] (direct descendant of the family of [[Muhammad]]), a 33nd{{Clarify|date=July 2015|reason=Should this be '32nd', '33rd' or something else?}}-generation scion of [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]].It has been recorded that the first of the ancestors of Syed Naushah Ganj Bakhsh Qadri, who came to the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, was Syed Awn ibn Ya\u2018la, well known by the name of Qutb Shah Qadri. This happened by order of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani in the fifth century AH (about the eleventh century AD). Moreover, he was an uncle of Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani and one of his spiritual successors born in 1028 in Baghdad. He is also the first person who introduced the Qadiria Order in India. Qutb Shah Qadiri was an appointed Qutb (spiritual pole) by Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani for this Indian subcontinent. Due to his great efforts many of the Hindu tribes converted to the Islam. Among them are the tribes of Rajput, Chohan and Khokar. Most of them attained a blessed life in the religion. Qutb Shah Qadiri returned after his mission, that he did for many years, to Baghdad where he died in 1157. In this city you can also find his holy grave.\n\nThe son and the spiritual successor of Qutb Shah Qadiri was Syed Zaman Ali Muhsin. He spread the Islam in the southwest regions of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, Kohistan-i Namak and the surroundings of Saunsakesar. Many people converted due to him to the Islam and joined in his circle of Murids (spiritual disciples). His work for the religion even impressed the local ruler \"Rani Bharat\", who later accepted the Islam as the true religion. The holy grave of Syed Zaman Ali Shah is located in Kirana, district Sargodha in Pakistan.\n\nSyed Mahmud Shah, better known as Pir Jalib, is one of the descendants of Syed Zaman Ali Shah. He was an outstanding saint who possessed super natural gifts, called Tasarrufat. He was also called Pir Jalib, because of his numerous benefactions and his spiritual attraction. Like his forefathers he was a spiritual perfected person. His holy burial place is in Ramdiana, district Sargodha. Syed Shamsuddin Shahid was a great saint from the descendants of Pir Jalib. He always took with him his favourite weapon, a javelin. Hence he was called Sangin Shah Shahid. He became a martyr when he died during a battle in the way of Allah. Sangin Shah had two sons: Syed Ala\u2019uddin Husain and Syed Rahimuddin. The holy graves of both the brothers are situated in Ghogganwali, near Qadirabad in the district Gujrat, Pakistan.\n\nSyed Ala\u2019uddin is reckoned among the great spiritual masters of the mystical path. He observed very accurately the Shair\u2018ah, the Islamic laws. He had the Kunyah (a nickname indicating a parental relationship) Abu Isma\u2018il with the extra appellation Pir Ghazi. Among his contemporaries, just as his younger brother, he was an exceptional saint, from whom supernatural powers have been revealed till today.

In celiac disease, one pathway that allows fragments of [[gliadin]] protein to get past the intestinal epithelium and subsequently trigger an [[Immune system|immune response]] begins with binding of indigestible gliadin fragments to the [[chemokine]] CXC motif receptor 3 ([[CXCR3]]) on the [[Lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] side of the intestinal epithelium (see [[Gluten immunochemistry#Infiltrating peptides|this page]]). This leads to the induction of myeloid differentiation factor 88 ([[MYD88]]) and the release of zonulin into the lumen. Zonulin then binds to [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)]] and [[Protease-activated receptor 2|protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)]] in the intestinal epithelium. This complex then initiates a signalling pathway that eventually results in tight junction disassembly and increased intestinal permeability. Larazotide acetate intervenes in the middle of this pathway by blocking zonulin receptors, thereby preventing tight junction disassembly and associated increase in intestinal permeability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fasano|first=Alessio|date=2011-01-01|title=Zonulin and Its Regulation of Intestinal Barrier Function: The Biological Door to Inflammation, Autoimmunity, and Cancer|journal=Physiological Reviews|language=en|volume=91|issue=1|pages=151\u2013175|doi=10.1152/physrev.00003.2008|issn=0031-9333|pmid=21248165|citeseerx=10.1.1.653.3967}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khaleghi|first=Shahryar|last2=Ju|first2=Josephine M.|last3=Lamba|first3=Abhinav|last4=Murray|first4=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-01|title=The potential utility of tight junction regulation in celiac disease: focus on larazotide acetate|journal=Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37\u201349|doi=10.1177/1756283X15616576|issn=1756-283X|pmc=4699279|pmid=26770266}}</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\nLarazotide acetate is a [[Peptide synthesis|synthetic peptide]] based on a ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[enterotoxin]] called zonula occludens toxin that decreases [[intestinal permeability]].

Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed....The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.<ref name=sgp114/> From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.<ref name=\"routledge42\" />\n\n==== Catholic Church ====\nIn 1929, the Fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century, but within two years the Church had renounced Fascism in the Encyclical [[Non Abbiamo Bisogno]] as a \"pagan idolotry of the state\" which teaches \"hatred, violence and irreverence\".<ref name=\"routledge43\" /> Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession the Church had threatened to have him \"excommunicated\", in part because of his intractable nature and that he had \"confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years\u201d.<ref>[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', New York: Vintage Books, 1983, p. 162</ref> By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the \u201cpapacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,\u2019 because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself\".<ref>[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', pp. 222\u201323</ref> In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was \"basically irreligious until the later years of his life\".<ref>Rachele Mussolini, ''Mussolini: An Intimate Biography'', New York: Pocket Books, 1977, p. 131.

Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the \"inferior\" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.<ref name=\"aaa134\" /> This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the [[Pacification of Libya]] against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s and the forced starvation of thousands of people.<ref name=aaa134/> Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.<ref name=\"mussolini\" /><ref name=\"university44\" />\n\n==== Hitler adopts Italian model ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, M\u00fcnchen, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Nazis in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]\nThe March on Rome brought Fascism international attention.

With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, [[liberal democracy]] was dissolved in Germany and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s, the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups.\n\nFascist movements grew in strength elsewhere in Europe. Hungarian fascist [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and attempted to entrench his [[Party of Hungarian Life|Party of National Unity]] throughout the country.

Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded Ethiopia in 1935]] resulting in its condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.<ref name=\"university52\" /> In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.<ref name=\"Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372\" /> The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.<ref name=\"Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372\"/>\n\nThe invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.<ref name=\"university53\" /> Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in [[Egypt]] where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.<ref name=\"university54\" /> Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged\u2014contrary to Mussolini's plans\u2014resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.\n\n[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|thumb|right|Corpses of victims of the German [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]]]\nDuring World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini [[25 Luglio|was removed as head of government and arrested]] on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.\n\nOn 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was [[denazification|systematically dismantled]] by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in [[Nuremberg#Nazi era|Nuremberg]]. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were [[Nuremberg trials|tried and convicted]] of [[war crime]]s, with many of the worst offenders receiving the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].\n\n=== Post-World War II (1945\u2013present) ===\n{{Main|Neo-fascism}}\n[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired [[Italian Fascism]] and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy]]\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in [[World War II]] led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.\n\n[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, a deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]], Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the [[Cold War]], until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.\n\n[[File:Giorgio Almirante crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Giorgio Almirante]], leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]] from 1969 to 1987]]\n\nHistorian [[Robert Paxton]] observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: \"In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization\". He goes on to observe that Salazar \"crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization\".<ref>Robert O.

In Italy, the [[Italian Social Movement]] led by [[Giorgio Almirante]] was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described \"post-fascist\" movement called the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), which has been an ally of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party [[The People of Freedom]], but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name [[Brothers of Italy]]. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.\n\n[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|right|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece in 2012]]\nAfter the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in [[Greece]]'s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.\n\n== Tenets ==\n[[Robert O. Paxton]] finds that the transformations undertaken by fascists in power were \"profound enough to be called 'revolutionary'\". They \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues: <blockquote>[F]ascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive\u2014party and state\u2014in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.<ref>[[Robert O. Paxton|Paxton, Robert O.]] (2004) ''The Anatomy Of Fascism''.

Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals, and in exchange, the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies.<ref name=\"bloomington\"/> Nazi Germany transferred public ownership and public services into the private sector, while other Western capitalist countries strove for increased state ownership of industry.<ref name=\"www\"/> In his book, ''Big Business in the Third Reich'', Arthur Schweitzer notes that, \"Monopolistic price fixing became the rule in most industries, and cartels were no longer confined to the heavy or large-scale industries.&nbsp;... Cartels and quasi-cartels (whether of big business or small) set prices, engaged in limiting production, and agreed to divide markets and classify consumers in order to realize a monopoly profit.<ref name=\"bloomington85\"/>\n\nFascists pursued economic policies to strengthen state power and spread ideology, such as consolidating trade unions and putting them under state or party control.<ref name=\"pauley86\"/> Attempts were made by both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany to establish \"[[autarky]]\" (self-sufficiency) through significant economic planning, but neither achieved economic self-sufficiency.<ref name=\"pauley87\"/>\n\n==== National corporatism, statism and national syndicalism ====\nItalian Fascism's economy was based on [[corporatism]], and a number of other fascist movements similarly promoted corporatism. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], describing fascist corporatism, said that \"it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole\".<ref name=\"re208\"/> Fascists were not hostile to the ''[[petit-bourgeoisie]]'' or to small businesses, and they promised these groups, alongside the proletariat, protection from the upper-class bourgeoisie, big business, and Marxism. The promotion of these groups is the source of the term \"extremism of the centre\" to describe fascism.<ref name=\"gr101\"/>\n\nFascism blamed capitalist [[liberal democracies]] for creating class conflict and communists for exploiting it.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> In Italy, the Fascist period presided over the creation of the largest number of state-owned enterprises in [[Western Europe]], such as the nationalisation of [[petroleum]] companies into a single state enterprise called the Italian General Agency for Petroleum (''Azienda Generale Italiani Petroli'', AGIP).<ref name=\"publishing88\"/> Fascists made populist appeals to the [[middle class]], especially the lower middle class, by promising to protect small businesses and property owners from communism, and by promising an economy based on competition and profit while pledging to oppose big business.<ref name=gr101/>\n\nIn 1933, Benito Mussolini declared Italian Fascism's opposition to the \"decadent capitalism\" that he claimed prevailed in the world at the time, but he did not denounce capitalism entirely. Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[Heroic capitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|heroic capitalism]] (1830\u20131870), followed by static capitalism (1870\u20131914), and reaching its final form of decadent capitalism or \"[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]\" beginning in 1914.<ref name=\"fz136\"/> Mussolini said that Italian Fascism acknowledged the positive achievements of dynamic and heroic capitalism for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and its technical developments, but that it did not favor supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.<ref name=fz136/>\n\nThus Mussolini claimed that Italy under Fascist rule was not capitalist in the contemporary use of the term, which referred to supercapitalism.<ref name=fz136/> Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the \"standardization of humankind\" and for causing excessive consumption.<ref name=\"aesthetics89\"/> Mussolini claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, \"a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously.\"<ref name=\"establishing\"/> He saw Fascism as the next logical step to solve the problems of supercapitalism and claimed that \"our path would lead inexorably into [[state capitalism]], which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation.\"<ref name=\"mb158-159\"/> Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.<ref name=\"salvemini\"/> [[Private enterprise]] would control production but it would be supervised by the state.<ref name=\"Salvemini. p. 134\"/> By the late 1930s and the 1940s, Italian Fascism completely denounced capitalism as an obsolete and oppressive system, Mussolini in 1940 at the entry of Italy into World War II, said:\n{{quote|''This conflict must not be allowed to cancel out all our achievements of the past eighteen years, nor, more importantly, extinguish the hope of a Third Alternative held out by Fascism to mankind fettered between the pillar of capitalist slavery and the post of Marxist chaos. The proponents of these obsolete doctrines must understand that the Fascist sword has been unsheathed twice before, in Ethiopia and in Spain, with known results.''|Benito Mussolini, 1940.<ref name=\"mediterranean\"/>}}\n\nItalian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.<ref name=\"Salvemini. p. 134\"/>\n\nOther fascist regimes were indifferent or hostile to corporatism. The Nazis initially attempted to form a corporatist economic system like that of Fascist Italy, creating the National Socialist Institute for Corporatism in May 1933, which included many major economists who said that corporatism was consistent with National Socialism.<ref name=\"minneapolis90\"/><ref name=\"routledge91\"/> In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler spoke enthusiastically about the \"National Socialist corporative idea\" as one that eventually would \"take the place of ruinous class warfare\".<ref name=\"aristotle92\"/> The Nazis later came to view corporatism as detrimental to Germany and institutionalizing and legitimizing social differences within the German nation. Instead, the Nazis began to promote economic organization that emphasized the biological unity of the German national community.<ref name=\"minneapolis93\"/>\n\nHitler continued to refer to corporatism in propaganda, but it was not put into place, even though a number of Nazi officials such as [[Walther Darr\u00e9]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Alfred Rosenburg]], and [[Gregor Strasser]] were in favor of a [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medievalist]] form of corporatism, since corporations had been influential in German history in the [[medieval]] era.<ref name=\"ideologies\"/>\n\nSpanish Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera did not believe that corporatism was effective and denounced it as a propaganda ploy, saying \"this stuff about the corporative state is another piece of windbaggery\".<ref name=\"ideologies94\"/>\n\n==== Economic planning ====\nFascists opposed the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies that were dominant in the era prior to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"political\"/> After the Great Depression began, many people from across the [[political spectrum]] blamed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, and fascists promoted their ideology as a \"[[Third Position|third way]]\" between capitalism and [[communism]].<ref name=pm168/>\n\nFascists declared their opposition to [[finance capitalism]], [[interest]] charging, and profiteering.<ref name=\"university95\"/> [[Nazism|Nazis]] and other antisemitic fascists considered finance capitalism a \"[[Parasitism|parasitic]]\" \"[[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy]]\".<ref name=\"socialism\"/> Fascist governments introduced [[Incomes policy|price controls]], wage controls and other types of [[Economic interventionism|economic interventionist]] measures.<ref name=\"Andreski-p64\"/>\n\nFascists thought that private property should be regulated to ensure that \"benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual.\"<ref name=\"reconciling\"/> Private [[property]] rights were supported but were contingent upon service to the state.<ref name=\"neofascism\"/> For example, \"an owner of agricultural land may be compelled to raise wheat instead of sheep and employ more labour than he would find profitable.\"<ref name=\"comparative96\"/> They promoted the interests of successful small businesses.<ref name=\"fascist\"/> Mussolini wrote approvingly of the notion that profits should not be taken away from those who produced them by their own labour, saying \"I do not respect\u2014I even hate\u2014those men that leech a tenth of the riches produced by others\".<ref name=\"mussolini97\"/>\n\nAccording to historian Tibor Ivan Berend, \"[[dirigisme]]\" was an inherent aspect of fascist economies.<ref name=\"university98\"/> The [[Labour Charter of 1927]], promulgated by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], stated in article 7: \"The corporative State considers private initiative, in the field of production, as the most efficient and useful instrument of the Nation\", then continued in article 9: \"State intervention in economic production may take place only where private initiative is lacking or is insufficient, or when are at stakes the political interest of the State. This intervention may take the form of control, encouragement or direct management.\"<ref name=\"corporativo\"/> -->\n\n== Criticism ==\nFascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.\n\n=== Anti-democratic and tyrannical ===\n{{Further|Anti-democratic thought}}\n[[File:Hitler and Franco at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hitler and Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Meeting at Hendaye]], on 23 October 1940]]\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a [[tyranny]].<ref>[[Roger Boesche]].

Mussolini, as I have learned to know him, is an opportunist in the sense that he believed that mankind itself must be fitted to changing conditions rather than to fixed theories, no matter how many hopes and prayers have been expended on theories and programmes\".<ref name=\"Benito Mussolini 1998\">Mussolini, Benito, ''My Rise And Fall, Volumes 1\u20132''. Da Capo Press ed. (Da Capo Press, 1998) p. ix. (Note: Mussolini wrote the second volume about his fall from power as head of government of the Kingdom of Italy in 1943, though he was restored to power in northern Italy by the German military.)</ref> Child quoted Mussolini as saying: \"The sanctity of an ism is not in the ism; it has no sanctity beyond its power to do, to work, to succeed in practice. It may have succeeded yesterday and fail to-morrow. Failed yesterday and succeed to-morrow. The machine first of all must run!\".<ref name=\"Benito Mussolini 1998\"/>\n\nSome have criticized Mussolini's actions during the outbreak of [[World War I]] as opportunist for seeming to suddenly abandon Marxist [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] for non-egalitarian [[nationalism]] and note to that effect that upon Mussolini endorsing Italy's intervention in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary, he and the new fascist movement received financial support from foreign sources, such as [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies<ref>Smith, Dennis Mack,''Modern Italy; A Political History''.

Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 17.</ref><ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\">[[John F. Pollard]]. ''The Fascist Experience in Italy''. Routledge, 1998. p. 129.</ref> Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during [[Dino Grandi]]'s tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in ''[[realpolitik]]'' free of such fascist hyperbole.<ref>[[H. James Burgwyn]]. ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918\u20131940''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p. 58.</ref> Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in [[Austria]], [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce [[Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]].\n\nAfter antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterraneanism]].<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\" /> Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the [[Lombards]] took control of Italy after the [[fall of Ancient Rome]], they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] language within fifty years.<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 93.</ref> Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of [[Italian nationalists]] scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of [[ancient Roman civilization]] as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]] to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as \"newcomers\" to civilization in comparison.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17\"/> At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman [[Arthur de Gobineau]].<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 45.</ref> After the tension in [[German-Italian relations]] diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/>\n\nIn 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic,<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse [[antisemitism]] until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period there had been notable [[Jewish Italians]] who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as [[Italo Balbo]], who came from [[Ferrara]] which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.<ref>Mark Neocleous.

[[Johann Plenge]]'s concept of the \"[[Spirit of 1914]]\" identified the outbreak of war as a moment that forged nationalistic German solidarity]]\nSimilar political ideas arose in Germany after the outbreak of the war. German sociologist [[Johann Plenge]] spoke of the rise of a \"National Socialism\" in Germany within what he termed the \"ideas of 1914\" that were a declaration of war against the \"ideas of 1789\" (the [[French Revolution]]).<ref name=\"Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205\" /> According to Plenge, the \"ideas of 1789\" that included rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism were being rejected in favor of \"the ideas of 1914\" that included \"German values\" of duty, discipline, law and order.<ref name=\"Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205\"/> Plenge believed that racial solidarity (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'') would replace class division and that \"racial comrades\" would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of \"proletarian\" Germany against \"capitalist\" Britain.<ref name=\"Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205\"/> He believed that the \"[[Spirit of 1914]]\" manifested itself in the concept of the \"People's League of National Socialism\".<ref name=\"Bernd-R\u00fcdiger H\u00fcppauf 1997. p. 92\" /> This National Socialism was a form of state socialism that rejected the \"idea of boundless freedom\" and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state.<ref name=\"Bernd-R\u00fcdiger H\u00fcppauf 1997. p. 92\"/> This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism because of the components that were against \"the national interest\" of Germany, but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy.<ref name=\"Bernd-R\u00fcdiger H\u00fcppauf 1997. p. 92\"/><ref name=CritTheory /> Plenge advocated an authoritarian rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic]] state.<ref name=\"Thomas Rohkr\u00e4mer 2007. p. 130\" />\n\n==== Impact of World War I ====\nFascists viewed World War I as bringing revolutionary changes in the nature of war, society, the state and technology, as the advent of [[total war]] and mass mobilization had broken down the distinction between civilian and combatant, as civilians had become a critical part in economic production for the war effort and thus arose a \"military citizenship\" in which all citizens were involved to the military in some manner during the war.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/><ref name=\"mann65\"/> World War I had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines or provide economic production and logistics to support those on the front lines, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/><ref name=\"mann65\" /> Fascists viewed technological developments of weaponry and the state's total mobilization of its population in the war as symbolizing the beginning of a new era fusing state power with [[mass politics]], technology and particularly the mobilizing myth that they contended had triumphed over the myth of progress and the era of liberalism.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/>\n\n[[File:Italian Arditi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Members of Italy's ''[[Arditi]]'' corps (here in 1918 holding daggers, a symbol of their group), which was formed in 1917 as groups of soldiers trained for dangerous missions, characterized by refusal to surrender and willingness to fight to the death.

The Fascists presented themselves as [[Anti-communism|anti-Marxists]] and as opposed to the Marxists.<ref name=\"revolution28\" /> Mussolini consolidated control over the Fascist movement, known as [[Sansepolcrismo]], in 1919 with the founding of the ''[[Fasci italiani di combattimento]]''.\n\n==== The ''Fascist Manifesto'' of 1919 ====\nIn 1919, [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement leader [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] created ''[[Fascist Manifesto|The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat]]'' (the ''Fascist Manifesto'').<ref name=\"connecticut30\" /> The Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia''.

The fascists banned literature on birth control and increased penalties for abortion in 1926, declaring both crimes against the state.<ref name=\"conservatives\" />\n\nThough Fascism adopted a number of anti-modern positions designed to appeal to people upset with the new trends in sexuality and women's rights\u2014especially those with a [[reactionary]] point of view\u2014the Fascists sought to maintain Fascism's revolutionary character, with Angelo Oliviero Olivetti saying: \"Fascism would like to be conservative, but it will [be] by being revolutionary\".<ref name=\"revolution38\" /> The Fascists supported revolutionary action and committed to secure law and order to appeal to both conservatives and syndicalists.<ref name=\"conservatives39\" />\n\nPrior to Fascism's accommodations to the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members.<ref name=\"massachusetts40\" /> After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.<ref name=\"massachusetts41\" />\n\n==== Fascist violence in 1922 ====\nBeginning in 1922, Fascist paramilitaries escalated their strategy from one of attacking socialist offices and homes of socialist leadership figures to one of violent occupation of cities. The Fascists met little serious resistance from authorities and proceeded to take over several northern Italian cities.<ref name=\"rop87\"/> The Fascists attacked the headquarters of socialist and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] labour unions in Cremona and imposed forced Italianization upon the German-speaking population of Trent and Bolzano.<ref name=rop87/> After seizing these cities, the Fascists made plans to take [[Rome]].<ref name=rop87/>\n\n[[File:March on Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Benito Mussolini]] with three of the four [[quadrumvirs]] during the [[March on Rome]] (from left to right: unknown, [[Emilio de Bono|de Bono]], Mussolini, [[Italo Balbo|Balbo]] and [[Cesare Maria de Vecchi|de Vecchi]])]]\nOn 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in [[Naples]], where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome.<ref name=rop87/> The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances.<ref name=\"rop88\" /> King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.<ref name=\"rop90\" /> Victor Emmanuel III decided to appoint Mussolini as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and Mussolini arrived in Rome on 30 October to accept the appointment.<ref name=rop90/> Fascist propaganda aggrandized this event, known as \"[[March on Rome]]\", as a \"seizure\" of power because of Fascists' heroic exploits.<ref name=rop87/>\n\n=== Fascist Italy ===\nHistorian [[Stanley G.

Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed....The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

Mussolini proclaimed himself dictator of Italy, assuming full responsibility over the government and announcing the dismissal of parliament.<ref name=sgp114/> From 1925 to 1929, Fascism steadily became entrenched in power: opposition deputies were denied access to parliament, censorship was introduced and a December 1925 decree made Mussolini solely responsible to the King.<ref name=\"routledge42\" />\n\n==== Catholic Church ====\nIn 1929, the Fascist regime briefly gained what was in effect a blessing of the Catholic Church after the regime signed a concordat with the Church, known as the [[Lateran Treaty]], which gave the papacy state sovereignty and financial compensation for the seizure of Church lands by the liberal state in the nineteenth century, but within two years the Church had renounced Fascism in the Encyclical [[Non Abbiamo Bisogno]] as a \"pagan idolotry of the state\" which teaches \"hatred, violence and irreverence\".<ref name=\"routledge43\" /> Not long after signing the agreement, by Mussolini's own confession the Church had threatened to have him \"excommunicated\", in part because of his intractable nature and that he had \"confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years\u201d.<ref>[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', New York: Vintage Books, 1983, p. 162</ref> By the late 1930s, Mussolini became more vocal in his anti-clerical rhetoric, repeatedly denouncing the Catholic Church and discussing ways to depose the pope. He took the position that the \u201cpapacy was a malignant tumor in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all,\u2019 because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and himself\".<ref>[[Denis Mack Smith]], ''Mussolini'', pp. 222\u201323</ref> In her 1974 book, Mussolini's widow Rachele stated that her husband had always been an atheist until near the end of his life, writing that her husband was \"basically irreligious until the later years of his life\".<ref>Rachele Mussolini, ''Mussolini: An Intimate Biography'', New York: Pocket Books, 1977, p. 131.

Instead, claiming that Italians were a superior race to African races and thereby had the right to colonize the \"inferior\" Africans, it sought to settle 10 to 15 million Italians in Libya.<ref name=\"aaa134\" /> This resulted in an aggressive military campaign known as the [[Pacification of Libya]] against natives in Libya, including mass killings, the use of [[concentration camp]]s and the forced starvation of thousands of people.<ref name=aaa134/> Italian authorities committed [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica in Libya, from their settlements that was slated to be given to Italian settlers.<ref name=\"mussolini\" /><ref name=\"university44\" />\n\n==== Hitler adopts Italian model ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, M\u00fcnchen, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Nazis in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]\nThe March on Rome brought Fascism international attention.

Mussolini called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] Italian claims to be reclaimed, establishing Italian domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and securing Italian access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the creation of Italian ''[[spazio vitale]]'' (\"vital space\") in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Red Sea]] regions.<ref name=\"expansionism50\" /> Hitler called for [[Irredentism|irredentist]] German claims to be reclaimed along with the creation of German ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") in Eastern Europe, including territories held by the [[Soviet Union]], that would be colonized by Germans.<ref name=\"expansionism51\" />\n\n[[File:Inmate at the Rab concentration camp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emaciation|Emaciated]] male inmate at the Italian [[Rab concentration camp]]]]\nFrom 1935 to 1939, Germany and Italy escalated their demands for territorial claims and greater influence in world affairs. Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded Ethiopia in 1935]] resulting in its condemnation by the [[League of Nations]] and its widespread diplomatic isolation. In 1936, Germany [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized the industrial Rhineland]], a region that had been ordered demilitarized by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1938, Germany annexed [[Austria]] and Italy assisted Germany in resolving the diplomatic crisis between Germany versus Britain and France over claims on [[Czechoslovakia]] by arranging the [[Munich Agreement]] that gave Germany the [[Sudetenland]] and was perceived at the time to have averted a European war. These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939. At the same time from 1938 to 1939, Italy was demanding territorial and colonial concessions from France and Britain.<ref name=\"university52\" /> In 1939, Germany prepared for war with Poland, but attempted to gain territorial concessions from Poland through diplomatic means.<ref name=\"Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372\" /> The Polish government did not trust Hitler's promises and refused to accept Germany's demands.<ref name=\"Eugene Davidson pp. 371-372\"/>\n\nThe invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. In 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from the German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.<ref name=\"university53\" /> Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in [[Egypt]] where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces.<ref name=\"university54\" /> Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the [[Battle of Britain]]. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. The war became prolonged\u2014contrary to Mussolini's plans\u2014resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance.\n\n[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|thumb|right|Corpses of victims of the German [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]]]\nDuring World War II, the Axis Powers in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Poles, Jews, Gypsies and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. In 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, the complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany, the Allied invasion of Italy and the corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini [[25 Luglio|was removed as head of government and arrested]] on the order of King Victor Emmanuel III, who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.\n\nOn 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide. Shortly afterwards, Germany surrendered and the Nazi regime was [[denazification|systematically dismantled]] by the occupying Allied powers. An International Military Tribunal was subsequently convened in [[Nuremberg#Nazi era|Nuremberg]]. Beginning in November 1945 and lasting through 1949, numerous Nazi political, military and economic leaders were [[Nuremberg trials|tried and convicted]] of [[war crime]]s, with many of the worst offenders receiving the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].\n\n=== Post-World War II (1945\u2013present) ===\n{{Main|Neo-fascism}}\n[[File:Juan Peron con banda de presidente.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[President of Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, admired [[Italian Fascism]] and modelled his economic policies on those pursued by Fascist Italy]]\nThe victory of the Allies over the Axis powers in [[World War II]] led to the collapse of many fascist regimes in Europe. The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted several Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained several movements and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.\n\n[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and it survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and Franco had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. The first years were characterized by a repression against the anti-fascist ideologies, a deep censorship and the suppression of democratic institutions (elected Parliament, [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]], Regional Statutes of Autonomy). After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with the Western powers during the [[Cold War]], until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.\n\n[[File:Giorgio Almirante crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Giorgio Almirante]], leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]] from 1969 to 1987]]\n\nHistorian [[Robert Paxton]] observes that one of the main problems in defining fascism is that it was widely mimicked. Paxton says: \"In fascism's heyday, in the 1930s, many regimes that were not functionally fascist borrowed elements of fascist decor in order to lend themselves an aura of force, vitality, and mass mobilization\". He goes on to observe that Salazar \"crushed Portuguese fascism after he had copied some of its techniques of popular mobilization\".<ref>Robert O.

In Italy, the [[Italian Social Movement]] led by [[Giorgio Almirante]] was a major neo-fascist movement that transformed itself into a self-described \"post-fascist\" movement called the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), which has been an ally of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] for a decade. In 2008, AN joined Forza Italia in Berlusconi's new party [[The People of Freedom]], but in 2012 a group of politicians split from The People of Freedom, refounding the party with the name [[Brothers of Italy]]. In Germany, various neo-Nazi movements have been formed and banned in accordance with Germany's constitutional law which forbids Nazism. The [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD) is widely considered a neo-Nazi party, although the party does not publicly identify itself as such.\n\n[[File:Golden Dawn demonstration 1.jpg|thumb|right|Golden Dawn demonstration in Greece in 2012]]\nAfter the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and economic crisis in Greece, a movement known as the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], widely considered a neo-Nazi party, soared in support out of obscurity and won seats in [[Greece]]'s parliament, espousing a staunch hostility towards minorities, illegal immigrants and refugees. In 2013, after the murder of an anti-fascist musician by a person with links to Golden Dawn, the Greek government ordered the arrest of Golden Dawn's leader [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and other Golden Dawn members on charges related to being associated with a criminal organization.\n\n== Tenets ==\n[[Robert O. Paxton]] finds that the transformations undertaken by fascists in power were \"profound enough to be called 'revolutionary'\". They \"often set fascists into conflict with conservatives rooted in families, churches, social rank, and property.\" Paxton argues: <blockquote>[F]ascism redrew the frontiers between private and public, sharply diminishing what had once been untouchably private. It changed the practice of citizenship from the enjoyment of constitutional rights and duties to participation in mass ceremonies of affirmation and conformity. It reconfigured relations between the individual and the collectivity, so that an individual had no rights outside community interest. It expanded the powers of the executive\u2014party and state\u2014in a bid for total control. Finally, it unleashed aggressive emotions hitherto known in Europe only during war or social revolution.<ref>[[Robert O. Paxton|Paxton, Robert O.]] (2004) ''The Anatomy Of Fascism''.

As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, \"from 1929...fascism has become a universal phenomenon... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, liberalism have been exhausted...the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist'(Mussolini 1935: 32).<ref name=\"Fascism in Europe, 1919\u20131945\"/></blockquote>\n\nFascists criticized [[egalitarianism]] as preserving the weak, and they instead promoted social Darwinist views and policies.<ref name=\"egalitarianism\" /><ref name=\"university101\" /> They were in principle opposed to the idea of [[social welfare]], arguing that it \"encouraged the preservation of the degenerate and the feeble.\"<ref>[[Richard J.

Mussolini went on to say that the solution to unemployment for men was the \"exodus of women from the work force\".<ref name=\"routledge75\" />\n\nThe German Nazi government strongly encouraged women to stay at home to bear children and keep house.<ref name=\"evans76\" /> This policy was reinforced by bestowing the [[Cross of Honor of the German Mother]] on women bearing four or more children. The unemployment rate was cut substantially, mostly through arms production and sending women home so that men could take their jobs.

Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals, and in exchange, the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies.<ref name=\"bloomington\"/> Nazi Germany transferred public ownership and public services into the private sector, while other Western capitalist countries strove for increased state ownership of industry.<ref name=\"www\"/> In his book, ''Big Business in the Third Reich'', Arthur Schweitzer notes that, \"Monopolistic price fixing became the rule in most industries, and cartels were no longer confined to the heavy or large-scale industries.&nbsp;... Cartels and quasi-cartels (whether of big business or small) set prices, engaged in limiting production, and agreed to divide markets and classify consumers in order to realize a monopoly profit.<ref name=\"bloomington85\"/>\n\nFascists pursued economic policies to strengthen state power and spread ideology, such as consolidating trade unions and putting them under state or party control.<ref name=\"pauley86\"/> Attempts were made by both Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany to establish \"[[autarky]]\" (self-sufficiency) through significant economic planning, but neither achieved economic self-sufficiency.<ref name=\"pauley87\"/>\n\n==== National corporatism, statism and national syndicalism ====\nItalian Fascism's economy was based on [[corporatism]], and a number of other fascist movements similarly promoted corporatism. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], describing fascist corporatism, said that \"it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole\".<ref name=\"re208\"/> Fascists were not hostile to the ''[[petit-bourgeoisie]]'' or to small businesses, and they promised these groups, alongside the proletariat, protection from the upper-class bourgeoisie, big business, and Marxism. The promotion of these groups is the source of the term \"extremism of the centre\" to describe fascism.<ref name=\"gr101\"/>\n\nFascism blamed capitalist [[liberal democracies]] for creating class conflict and communists for exploiting it.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> In Italy, the Fascist period presided over the creation of the largest number of state-owned enterprises in [[Western Europe]], such as the nationalisation of [[petroleum]] companies into a single state enterprise called the Italian General Agency for Petroleum (''Azienda Generale Italiani Petroli'', AGIP).<ref name=\"publishing88\"/> Fascists made populist appeals to the [[middle class]], especially the lower middle class, by promising to protect small businesses and property owners from communism, and by promising an economy based on competition and profit while pledging to oppose big business.<ref name=gr101/>\n\nIn 1933, Benito Mussolini declared Italian Fascism's opposition to the \"decadent capitalism\" that he claimed prevailed in the world at the time, but he did not denounce capitalism entirely. Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[Heroic capitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|heroic capitalism]] (1830\u20131870), followed by static capitalism (1870\u20131914), and reaching its final form of decadent capitalism or \"[[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]]\" beginning in 1914.<ref name=\"fz136\"/> Mussolini said that Italian Fascism acknowledged the positive achievements of dynamic and heroic capitalism for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and its technical developments, but that it did not favor supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.<ref name=fz136/>\n\nThus Mussolini claimed that Italy under Fascist rule was not capitalist in the contemporary use of the term, which referred to supercapitalism.<ref name=fz136/> Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the \"standardization of humankind\" and for causing excessive consumption.<ref name=\"aesthetics89\"/> Mussolini claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, \"a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously.\"<ref name=\"establishing\"/> He saw Fascism as the next logical step to solve the problems of supercapitalism and claimed that \"our path would lead inexorably into [[state capitalism]], which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation.\"<ref name=\"mb158-159\"/> Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.<ref name=\"salvemini\"/> [[Private enterprise]] would control production but it would be supervised by the state.<ref name=\"Salvemini. p. 134\"/> By the late 1930s and the 1940s, Italian Fascism completely denounced capitalism as an obsolete and oppressive system, Mussolini in 1940 at the entry of Italy into World War II, said:\n{{quote|''This conflict must not be allowed to cancel out all our achievements of the past eighteen years, nor, more importantly, extinguish the hope of a Third Alternative held out by Fascism to mankind fettered between the pillar of capitalist slavery and the post of Marxist chaos. The proponents of these obsolete doctrines must understand that the Fascist sword has been unsheathed twice before, in Ethiopia and in Spain, with known results.''|Benito Mussolini, 1940.<ref name=\"mediterranean\"/>}}\n\nItalian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.<ref name=\"Salvemini. p. 134\"/>\n\nOther fascist regimes were indifferent or hostile to corporatism. The Nazis initially attempted to form a corporatist economic system like that of Fascist Italy, creating the National Socialist Institute for Corporatism in May 1933, which included many major economists who said that corporatism was consistent with National Socialism.<ref name=\"minneapolis90\"/><ref name=\"routledge91\"/> In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler spoke enthusiastically about the \"National Socialist corporative idea\" as one that eventually would \"take the place of ruinous class warfare\".<ref name=\"aristotle92\"/> The Nazis later came to view corporatism as detrimental to Germany and institutionalizing and legitimizing social differences within the German nation. Instead, the Nazis began to promote economic organization that emphasized the biological unity of the German national community.<ref name=\"minneapolis93\"/>\n\nHitler continued to refer to corporatism in propaganda, but it was not put into place, even though a number of Nazi officials such as [[Walther Darr\u00e9]], [[Gottfried Feder]], [[Alfred Rosenburg]], and [[Gregor Strasser]] were in favor of a [[Neo-medievalism|neo-medievalist]] form of corporatism, since corporations had been influential in German history in the [[medieval]] era.<ref name=\"ideologies\"/>\n\nSpanish Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera did not believe that corporatism was effective and denounced it as a propaganda ploy, saying \"this stuff about the corporative state is another piece of windbaggery\".<ref name=\"ideologies94\"/>\n\n==== Economic planning ====\nFascists opposed the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies that were dominant in the era prior to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"political\"/> After the Great Depression began, many people from across the [[political spectrum]] blamed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, and fascists promoted their ideology as a \"[[Third Position|third way]]\" between capitalism and [[communism]].<ref name=pm168/>\n\nFascists declared their opposition to [[finance capitalism]], [[interest]] charging, and profiteering.<ref name=\"university95\"/> [[Nazism|Nazis]] and other antisemitic fascists considered finance capitalism a \"[[Parasitism|parasitic]]\" \"[[antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy]]\".<ref name=\"socialism\"/> Fascist governments introduced [[Incomes policy|price controls]], wage controls and other types of [[Economic interventionism|economic interventionist]] measures.<ref name=\"Andreski-p64\"/>\n\nFascists thought that private property should be regulated to ensure that \"benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual.\"<ref name=\"reconciling\"/> Private [[property]] rights were supported but were contingent upon service to the state.<ref name=\"neofascism\"/> For example, \"an owner of agricultural land may be compelled to raise wheat instead of sheep and employ more labour than he would find profitable.\"<ref name=\"comparative96\"/> They promoted the interests of successful small businesses.<ref name=\"fascist\"/> Mussolini wrote approvingly of the notion that profits should not be taken away from those who produced them by their own labour, saying \"I do not respect\u2014I even hate\u2014those men that leech a tenth of the riches produced by others\".<ref name=\"mussolini97\"/>\n\nAccording to historian Tibor Ivan Berend, \"[[dirigisme]]\" was an inherent aspect of fascist economies.<ref name=\"university98\"/> The [[Labour Charter of 1927]], promulgated by the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], stated in article 7: \"The corporative State considers private initiative, in the field of production, as the most efficient and useful instrument of the Nation\", then continued in article 9: \"State intervention in economic production may take place only where private initiative is lacking or is insufficient, or when are at stakes the political interest of the State. This intervention may take the form of control, encouragement or direct management.\"<ref name=\"corporativo\"/> -->\n\n== Criticism ==\nFascism has been widely criticized and condemned in modern times since the defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II.\n\n=== Anti-democratic and tyrannical ===\n{{Further|Anti-democratic thought}}\n[[File:Hitler and Franco at Hendaye (en.wiki).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Hitler and Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Meeting at Hendaye]], on 23 October 1940]]\nOne of the most common and strongest criticisms of fascism is that it is a [[tyranny]].<ref>[[Roger Boesche]].

Major examples of ideological dishonesty have been identified in Italian fascism's changing relationship with German Nazism.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 17.</ref><ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\">[[John F. Pollard]]. ''The Fascist Experience in Italy''. Routledge, 1998. p. 129.</ref> Fascist Italy's official foreign policy positions were known to commonly utilize rhetorical ideological [[hyperbole]] to justify its actions, although during [[Dino Grandi]]'s tenure as Italy's foreign minister the country engaged in ''[[realpolitik]]'' free of such fascist hyperbole.<ref>[[H. James Burgwyn]]. ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918\u20131940''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p. 58.</ref> Italian fascism's stance towards German Nazism fluctuated from support from the late 1920s to 1934, when it celebrated Hitler's rise to power and meeting with Hitler in 1934; to opposition from 1934 to 1936 after the assassination of Italy's allied leader in [[Austria]], [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], by Austrian Nazis; and again back to support after 1936, when Germany was the only significant power that did not denounce [[Italy's invasion and occupation of Ethiopia]].\n\nAfter antagonism exploded between Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] over the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in 1934, Mussolini and Italian fascists denounced and ridiculed Nazism's racial theories, particularly by denouncing its [[Nordic race|Nordicism]], while promoting [[Mediterraneanism]].<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\" /> Mussolini himself responded to Nordicists' claims of Italy being divided into Nordic and Mediterranean racial areas due to Germanic invasions of Northern Italy by claiming that while Germanic tribes such as the [[Lombards]] took control of Italy after the [[fall of Ancient Rome]], they arrived in small numbers (about 8,000) and quickly assimilated into Roman culture and spoke the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin]] language within fifty years.<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2001. p. 93.</ref> Italian fascism was influenced by the tradition of [[Italian nationalists]] scornfully looking down upon Nordicists' claims and taking pride in comparing the age and sophistication of [[ancient Roman civilization]] as well as the classical revival in the [[Renaissance]] to that of Nordic societies that Italian nationalists described as \"newcomers\" to civilization in comparison.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. p. 17\"/> At the height of antagonism between the Nazis and Italian fascists over race, Mussolini claimed that the Germans themselves were not a pure race and noted with irony that the Nazi theory of German racial superiority was based on the theories of non-German foreigners, such as Frenchman [[Arthur de Gobineau]].<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial theories in fascist Italy''. London; New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 45.</ref> After the tension in [[German-Italian relations]] diminished during the late 1930s, Italian fascism sought to harmonize its ideology with German Nazism and combined Nordicist and Mediterranean racial theories, noting that Italians were members of the Aryan Race, composed of a mixed Nordic-Mediterranean subtype.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/>\n\nIn 1938, Mussolini declared upon Italy's adoption of antisemitic laws that Italian fascism had always been antisemitic,<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> In fact, Italian fascism did not endorse [[antisemitism]] until the late 1930s when Mussolini feared alienating antisemitic Nazi Germany, whose power and influence were growing in Europe. Prior to that period there had been notable [[Jewish Italians]] who had been senior Italian fascist officials, including [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who had also been Mussolini's mistress.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> Also contrary to Mussolini's claim in 1938, only a small number of Italian fascists were staunchly antisemitic (such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] and Giuseppe Preziosi), while others such as [[Italo Balbo]], who came from [[Ferrara]] which had one of Italy's largest Jewish communities, were disgusted by the antisemitic laws and opposed them.<ref name=\"John Pollard 1998. p. 129\"/> Fascism scholar Mark Neocleous notes that while Italian fascism did not have a clear commitment to antisemitism, there were occasional antisemitic statements issued prior to 1938, such as Mussolini in 1919 declaring that the Jewish bankers in London and New York were connected by race to the Russian [[Bolshevik]]s and that eight percent of the Russian Bolsheviks were Jews.<ref>Mark Neocleous.
