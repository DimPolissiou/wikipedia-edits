On the other hand, the Romans continued to occupy the Dodekashoinos (\"Twelve-Mile Lands\") as a military border zone, so the frontier now lay near Hiere Sycaminos (Maharraqa).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThis arrangement continued until the end of the third century AD, with relations between Meroe and Roman Egypt remaining generally peaceful during this time (F.

Amanirenas and Akinidad defeated Roman forces at [[Aswan|Syene]] and [[Philae]], and drove the Jews from [[Elephantine]] Island.<ref name=\"Robinson1928\" /> \n\n[[Neil MacGregor]] refers to Strabo's account of a \"fierce one-eyed queen Candace\" capturing a series of Roman forts in southern 25 BC Sudan. Her army returned with [[Mero\u00eb Head|a bronze depiction]] of [[Augustus]]' head, taken from a statue of the [[Roman emperor]]. She then \"buried the severed head of the glorious Augustus beneath the steps of a temple dedicated to victory.\" The head, found in [[Mero\u00eb]] in 1912, now resides in the [[British Museum]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacGregor |first1=Neil |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects |date=2011 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=9780670022700 |pages=221-226}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Shillington |first1=Kevin |title=History of Africa |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave |location=London |isbn=9780230308473 |page=54}}</ref>\n\n===Petronius' Nubian campaign===\nThe Kushites were driven out of Syene later in the year by [[Gaius Petronius]], who now held the office of Roman Prefect in Egypt. According to a detailed report made by Strabo (17: 53-54), the Roman troops advanced far into Kush, and finally reached Napata. Although they withdrew again to the north they left behind a garrison in [[Qasr Ibrim]] (Primis), which now became the border of the Roman Empire. The Kushites made a renewed attempt to seize Primis, but Petronius forestalled this attempt.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nFollowing this event, negotiations began.<ref name=\"Jaques2007\" /><ref name=\"Robinson1928\" /> The Meroites sent mediators to Augustus, who was then in Samos, and in the year 21/20 BC a peace treaty was concluded. It was strikingly favorable to the Meroites in that the southern part of the Thirty-Mile Strip, including Primis, was evacuated by the Romans, and the Meroites were exempted from having to pay tribute to the Emperor. On the other hand, the Romans continued to occupy the Dodekashoinos (\"Twelve-Mile Lands\") as a military border zone, so the frontier now lay near Hiere Sycaminos (Maharraqa).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThis arrangement continued until the end of the third century AD, with relations between Meroe and Roman Egypt remaining generally peaceful during this time (F. Hintze 1978:100). However, the kingdom of Kush had begun to fade as a power by the first or second century AD.<ref name=\"BBCWS\">{{Cite web |title=The Story of Africa : Nubia |author= |work=BBC World Service |date=n.d. |access-date=7 September 2018 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/3chapter4.shtml |language= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]\n*[[Kandake]]\n*[[List of monarchs of Kush]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f6r\u00f6k]], in: ''Fontes Historiae Nubiorum'' Vol. II, p.&nbsp;723-725 (Bergen, 1996). {{ISBN|82-91626-01-4}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Snowden|first=Frank M. |title=Blacks in Antiquity: Ethiopians in the Greco-Roman Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37MTRCr9oAUC|year=1970|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07626-6}}\n\n== External links==\n{{Commons cat}}\n*[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower00000.htm\"Women in power 500-B.C. 1\" at Guide2womenleaders.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611192753/http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/muzeum/muz_eng/naga08.htm Stela found in Naqa]\n*[http://oi.uchicago.edu/OI/MUS/PA/EGYPT/BEES/IMAGES/MEROE/II1D3_4.html Chicago Oriental Institute Archive: picture of her destroyed pyramid]\n*{{imdb title|id=2117841|title= Candace of Meroe}} A short animation about Amanirenas.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amanirenas}}\n[[Category:1st century BC in Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC monarchs of Kush]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC women rulers]]\n[[Category:History of Sudan]]\n[[Category:Nubian women in warfare]]\n[[Category:Queens of Kush]]\n[[Category:Ancient queens regnant]]\n[[Category:Blind royalty and nobility]]\n", "name_user": "Tameamseo", "label": "safe", "comment": "reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanirenas"}

The name of Uricani is derived from the union of two villages, Hobi\u021ba (''Hobica'', listed in documents from 1473 first as ''Ohabycza'') and Uric (''Urik'', from 1473 first as ''Wryk'') from Ha\u021beg Land.
