The stems of these plants are usually winding, hence their Latin name (from ''convolvere'', \"to wind\"). The leaves are simple and alternate, without [[stipule]]s. In parasitic [[Cuscuta]] they are reduced to scales. The fruit can be a capsule, berry, or nut, all containing only two seeds per one [[locule]] (one [[ovule]]/[[ovary]]).\n[[File:EB1911 Convolvulus sepium.jpg|thumb|left|''Convolvulus sepium'', slightly reduced.]]\n\nThe leaves and starchy, [[tuberous root]]s of some species are used as [[food]]stuffs (e.g. [[sweet potato]] and [[Ipomoea aquatica|water spinach]]), and the seeds are exploited for their medicinal value as [[purgative]]s. Some species contain [[ergoline]] [[alkaloids]] that are likely responsible for the use of these species as ingredients in [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[Psychoactive drugs|drugs]] (e.g. [[ololiuhqui]]). The presence of ergolines in some species of this family is due to infection by [[fungi]] related to the ergot fungi of the genus ''[[Claviceps]]''. A recent study of Convolvulaceae species, ''[[Ipomoea asarifolia]]'', and its associated [[fungi]] showed the presence of a fungus, identified by [[DNA sequencing]] of 18s and ITS [[ribosomal DNA]] and [[phylogeny|phylogenetic analysis]] to be closely related to fungi in the family [[Clavicipitaceae]], was always associated with the presence of ergoline alkaloids in the plant. The identified fungus appears to be a seed-transmitted, obligate [[biotroph]] growing [[epiphytic]]ally on its host.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ulrike Steiner |author2=Mahalia A.

The stems of these plants are usually winding, hence their Latin name (from ''convolvere'', \"to wind\"). The leaves are simple and alternate, without [[stipule]]s. In parasitic [[Cuscuta]] they are reduced to scales. The fruit can be a capsule, berry, or nut, all containing only two seeds per one [[locule]] (one [[ovule]]/[[ovary]]).\n[[File:EB1911 Convolvulus sepium.jpg|thumb|left|''Convolvulus sepium'', slightly reduced.]]\n\nThe leaves and starchy, [[tuberous root]]s of some species are used as [[food]]stuffs (e.g. [[sweet potato]] and [[Ipomoea aquatica|water spinach]]), and the seeds are exploited for their medicinal value as [[purgative]]s. Some species contain [[ergoline]] [[alkaloids]] that are likely responsible for the use of these species as ingredients in [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[Psychoactive drugs|drugs]] (e.g. [[ololiuhqui]]). The presence of ergolines in some species of this family is due to infection by [[fungi]] related to the ergot fungi of the genus ''[[Claviceps]]''. A recent study of Convolvulaceae species, ''[[Ipomoea asarifolia]]'', and its associated [[fungi]] showed the presence of a fungus, identified by [[DNA sequencing]] of 18s and ITS [[ribosomal DNA]] and [[phylogeny|phylogenetic analysis]] to be closely related to fungi in the family [[Clavicipitaceae]], was always associated with the presence of ergoline alkaloids in the plant. The identified fungus appears to be a seed-transmitted, obligate [[biotroph]] growing [[epiphytic]]ally on its host.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ulrike Steiner |author2=Mahalia A.
