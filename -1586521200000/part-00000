The screenplay by [[Carrie Fisher]] is based on her 1987 semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] [[Postcards from the Edge|novel of the same title]]. The film stars [[Meryl Streep]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], and [[Dennis Quaid]].\n\n==Plot==\nActress Suzanne Vale ([[Meryl Streep]]) is a recovering [[Addiction|drug addict]] trying to pick up the pieces of her acting [[career]] and get on with her life after being discharged from a [[drug rehabilitation|rehab center]] to kick a [[cocaine]]-[[Oxycodone/aspirin|Percodan]] habit; after overdosing while on a date, her mother admitted her to the rehab center from the emergency room. When she is ready to return to work her agent advises her the studio's insurance policy will cover her only if she lives with a \"responsible\" individual such as her mother Doris Mann ([[Shirley MacLaine]]). Suzanne is very reluctant to return to the woman from whom she struggled to escape for years after growing up in her shadow. The situation is not helped by the fact that Doris is very loud, competitive, manipulative, self-absorbed and given to offering her daughter unsolicited advice with insinuating value judgments while treating her like a child.\n\nProducer Jack Faulkner ([[Dennis Quaid]]) runs into Suzanne on the set and reveals that he is the one who drove her to the hospital during her last overdose, and the two kiss. Suzanne then agrees to go out with him. During the course of a passionate first date, he professes intense and eternal love for her and she believes every word is true. Suzanne's euphoria is short-lived, however; she subsequently learns from Evelyn Ames ([[Annette Bening]]), a [[Bit part|bit player]] in her latest film, that Jack is sleeping with Evelyn as well. Still dressed in the costume she wears as a uniformed cop in the [[Kitsch|schlock]] movie, Suzanne drives to Jack's house and confronts him. As their argument escalates, Jack implies that Suzanne was much more interesting when she was trying to function while [[Driving under the influence|under the influence]].\n\nAt home, Suzanne learns from Doris that Suzanne's sleazy business manager Marty Wiener has absconded with all her money. This leads to an argument between the two women, and Suzanne storms out to go to a [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|looping]] session. There the paternalistic director Lowell Kolchek ([[Gene Hackman]]) tells her he has more work for her as long as she can remain clean and sober.\n\nSuzanne arrives home and discovers that Doris has crashed her car into a tree after drinking too much wine (and [[Stolichnaya]] [[smoothie]]s). Suzanne rushes to her hospital bedside where the two have a heart-to-heart talk while Suzanne fixes her mother's makeup and arranges a scarf on her head to conceal the fact she bloodied her wig in the accident. Looking and feeling better, Doris musters her courage and faces the media waiting for her. Suzanne runs into Dr. Frankenthal ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), who had pumped her stomach after her last overdose, and he invites her to see a movie with him. She declines, telling him she's not ready to date yet. Dr. Frankenthal tells her he's willing to wait until she is.\n\nIn the film's closing moments Suzanne performs \"I'm Checkin' Out,\" a foot-stomping [[Country music|Country Western]] number, for a scene in Lowell Kolchek's new film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Suzanne Vale\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Doris Mann\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack Faulkner\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Lowell Kolchek\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Dr. Frankenthal\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Joe Pierce\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Grandma\n* [[Conrad Bain]] as Grandpa\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Evelyn Ames\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Simon Asquith\n* [[Gary Morton]] as Marty Wiener\n* [[C.

I'm not shocked that people think it's about me and my mother. It's easier for them to think I have no imagination for language, just a tape recorder with endless batteries.\"<ref name=\"EW\" /> In the DVD commentary she notes that her mother wanted to portray Doris but Nichols cast [[Shirley MacLaine]] instead. In her 2013 autobiography, ''Unsinkable'', Reynolds noted that Nichols told her, \"You're not right for the part.\"\n\n[[Blue Rodeo]] accompanied [[Meryl Streep]] on \"I'm Checkin' Out,\" written by [[Shel Silverstein]]. Other songs performed in the film include \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\" (sung by MacLaine) and \"[[You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold song)|You Don't Know Me]]\" (sung by Streep).\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film earned positive reviews from critics and currently holds an 84% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews.\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"seems to have been a terrifically genial collaboration between the writer and the director, Miss Fisher's tale of odd-ball woe being perfect material for Mr. Nichols's particular ability to discover the humane sensibility within the absurd.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CEFD8173FF931A2575AC0A966958260 |title='&#39;New York Times'&#39; review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1990-09-12 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, \"What's disappointing about the movie is that it never really delivers on the subject of recovery from addiction. There are some incomplete, dimly seen, unrealized scenes in the rehab center, and then desultory talk about offscreen [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings. But the film is preoccupied with [[gossip]]; we're encouraged to wonder how many parallels there are between the Streep and MacLaine characters and their originals, Fisher and Debbie Reynolds...

In fact, almost nothing else seems to matter to him... But while Nichols is servicing his star, he lets the other areas of the film go slack...

Looking and feeling better, Doris musters her courage and faces the media waiting for her. Suzanne runs into Dr. Frankenthal ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), who had pumped her stomach after her last overdose, and he invites her to see a movie with him. She declines, telling him she's not ready to date yet. Dr. Frankenthal tells her he's willing to wait until she is.\n\nIn the film's closing moments Suzanne performs \"I'm Checkin' Out,\" a foot-stomping [[Country music|Country Western]] number, for a scene in Lowell Kolchek's new film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Suzanne Vale\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Doris Mann\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Jack Faulkner\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Lowell Kolchek\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Dr. Frankenthal\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Joe Pierce\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Grandma\n* [[Conrad Bain]] as Grandpa\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Evelyn Ames\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Simon Asquith\n* [[Gary Morton]] as Marty Wiener\n* [[C.

I'm not shocked that people think it's about me and my mother. It's easier for them to think I have no imagination for language, just a tape recorder with endless batteries.\"<ref name=\"EW\" /> In the DVD commentary she notes that her mother wanted to portray Doris but Nichols cast [[Shirley MacLaine]] instead. In her 2013 autobiography, ''Unsinkable'', Reynolds noted that Nichols told her, \"You're not right for the part.\"\n\n[[Blue Rodeo]] accompanied [[Meryl Streep]] on \"I'm Checkin' Out,\" written by [[Shel Silverstein]]. Other songs performed in the film include \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\" (sung by MacLaine) and \"[[You Don't Know Me (Eddy Arnold song)|You Don't Know Me]]\" (sung by Streep).\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film earned positive reviews from critics and currently holds an 84% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews.\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"seems to have been a terrifically genial collaboration between the writer and the director, Miss Fisher's tale of odd-ball woe being perfect material for Mr. Nichols's particular ability to discover the humane sensibility within the absurd.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CEFD8173FF931A2575AC0A966958260 |title='&#39;New York Times'&#39; review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1990-09-12 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, \"What's disappointing about the movie is that it never really delivers on the subject of recovery from addiction. There are some incomplete, dimly seen, unrealized scenes in the rehab center, and then desultory talk about offscreen [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings. But the film is preoccupied with [[gossip]]; we're encouraged to wonder how many parallels there are between the Streep and MacLaine characters and their originals, Fisher and Debbie Reynolds...

In fact, almost nothing else seems to matter to him... But while Nichols is servicing his star, he lets the other areas of the film go slack...

Based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the [[Earth]] should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June&nbsp;2,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} when its [[orbital speed]] is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the [[galaxy]] and to a smaller one around December&nbsp;2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements.\n\n==Description==\nThe experimental set-up was located deep underground in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]] in [[Italy]].\n\nThe experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70&nbsp;kg low-radioactivity scintillating [[thallium]]-doped [[sodium iodide]]  [[crystal]]s [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background [[photomultiplier]]s through 10&nbsp;cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium foil. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglas]] box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A concrete [[neutron]] moderator 1&nbsp;m thick largely surrounds the set-up.\n\n==Results==\nThe DAMA/NaI set-up observed the annual modulation signature over 7&nbsp;annual cycles (1995\u20132002). The presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of DAMA/NaI was first reported by the DAMA collaboration in fall&nbsp;1997 and published beginning of 1998.<ref name=\"mod1\">{{cite

Based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the [[Earth]] should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June&nbsp;2,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} when its [[orbital speed]] is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the [[galaxy]] and to a smaller one around December&nbsp;2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements.\n\n==Description==\nThe experimental set-up was located deep underground in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]] in [[Italy]].\n\nThe experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70&nbsp;kg low-radioactivity scintillating [[thallium]]-doped [[sodium iodide]]  [[crystal]]s [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background [[photomultiplier]]s through 10&nbsp;cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium foil. A [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglas]] box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A concrete [[neutron]] moderator 1&nbsp;m thick largely surrounds the set-up.\n\n==Results==\nThe DAMA/NaI set-up observed the annual modulation signature over 7&nbsp;annual cycles (1995\u20132002). The presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of DAMA/NaI was first reported by the DAMA collaboration in fall&nbsp;1997 and published beginning of 1998.<ref name=\"mod1\">{{cite

According to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Blanc of Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie de la Firme et des Institutions, complementary currencies aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy.{{r|cc|page=7}} They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals.{{r|hal|page=4}}\n\nWhen speaking about complementary currencies, a number of overlapping and often interchangeable terms are in use: [[Local currency|local]] or [[Community currency|community]] currencies are complementary currencies used within a locality or other form of community (such as business-based or online communities); regional currencies are similar to local currencies, but are used within a larger geographical region; and [[sectoral currency|sectoral]] currencies are complementary currencies used within a single economic sector, such as education or health care. Many [[private currencies]] are complementary currencies issued by private businesses or organizations. Other terms include '''alternative currency''', [[auxiliary currencies|auxiliary currency]], and microcurrency. [[Mutual credit]] is a form of alternative currency, and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency. [[Barter]]s are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which trade only items, without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, [[Local Exchange Trading Systems|LETS]] is a special form of barter that trades points for items. One point stands for one worker-hour of work, and is thus a [[Time-based currency]].\n\n==Purposes==\nCurrent complementary currencies have often been designed intentionally to address specific issues, for example to increase financial stability.{{r|crisis}} Most complementary currencies have multiple purposes and/or are intended to address multiple issues. They can be useful for communities that do not have access to financial capital, and for adjusting peoples' spending behavior.{{r|boot}} The 2006 Annual Report of the Worldwide Database of Complementary Currency Systems presented a survey of 150 complementary currency systems in which 94 respondents said that \"all reasons\" were selected, among cooperation, micro/small/medium enterprise development, activating the local market, reducing the need for national currency, and community development.{{r|\"DeMeulenaere\"}}\n\nAims may include:\n* lifeboat currencies{{Technical statement|date=November 2019}}\n* to increase financial stability{{r|crisis}}\n* to reduce carbon emissions, by encouraging localisation of trade and relationships\n* to encouraging use of under-used resources{{r|ccg2006|page=2}}\n* to recognise the informal economy\n* promote local businesses\n\n===Advantages===\nSome alternative currencies devalue rapidly (they are called Schwundgeld); this increases monetary circulation. The [[Miracle of W\u00f6rgl]] is an event that showed the potential of this increased spending through the introduction of a local currency known as [[Freigeld]]. Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the [[money]] always keeps circulating locally, benefiting only the local economy.\n\nAlternative currencies are reported to work as a counterbalance for the local economy. They increase in activity if the local economy slows down, and decrease in activity if the local economy goes up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stodder|first=James|title=Implications for Macroeconomic Stability|url=http://www.lietaer.com/images/Stodder_Reciprocal_Exchange.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=January 2005}}</ref>{{Dubious|No mention of alternative currency|reason=No mention of alternative currency|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs a commercial tool within a business, as opposed to a geographical social tool, a complementary currency can open a business up to a preferred source marketplace whereby they can sell their otherwise devalued or worthless spare capacity in exchange for the complementary currency. By selling their spare capacity (empty hotel rooms / under utilised staff hours / blank diary slots / excess stock) the business is able to harness the otherwise lost value gaining some key benefits such as :- Improved profits; stronger balance sheet; enhanced cash flow; more customers and a growth in market share.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nAlternative currencies promoted as [[local currencies]] which cannot be spent outside the community have limited use.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAccording to professor Nikolaus L\u00e4ufer, the use of local currencies such as Freigeld can only increase economic activity temporarily. Lengthy use of a local currency will ultimately result in a decline in economic activity and lead to a destabilization of the economy. This is due to the increased circulation velocity of the money as the amount in circulation decreases (as currencies as Freigeld reduce in value rapidly).<ref>{{cite web|last=L\u00e4ufer|first=Nikolaus|title=Natural Economic Order Theories or Freiwirtschaftslehre (Silvio Gesell)|url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/wiwi/laufer/main.html#FREI|publisher=University of Konstanz|accessdate=3 April 2014||date= 31 December 2006|language=German}}</ref>{{ clarify | date = June 2015 | reason = More specific link required}}\n\n==Tax==\n{{Expand section|section=2|date=May 2019}}\nOften there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax-status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\n==Types==\nComplementary currencies describe a wide group of exchange systems, currencies or [[scrip]]s designed to be used in combination with standard currencies or other complementary currencies. They can be valued and exchanged in relationship to national currencies but also function as [[Medium of exchange|media of exchange]] on their own. Complementary currencies lie outside the nationally defined legal realm of [[legal tender]] and are not used as such. Rate of exchange, scope of circulation and use in combination with other currencies differs greatly between complementary currency systems, as is the case with national currency systems.\n\n[[File:Freigeld1.jpg|thumb|One [[W\u00f6rgl]] Schilling note with [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] stamps]]\nSome complementary currencies incorporate value scales based on time or the backing of real resources (gold, oil, services, etc.). A [[time-based currency]] is valued by the time required to perform a service in hours, notwithstanding the potential market value of the service. Another type of complementary monetary systems is the barter, an exchange of specific goods or services is performed without the use of any currency.\n\nIn 1982, the most widespread auxiliary currency system, the [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]], was created. It regulates the exchange of goods and services between the members of the cooperative. Examples for an investment system of complementary currency are the Automatic Social Financial Network (ASFN) and the international [[crowdsourcing]] and [[crowd-funding]] community Evolution RA<ref>http://asfn.info/en/</ref> whose members use their own complementary virtual currency \"\u0421yber-gold\". The introductory fee paid by the new association members is subsequently directed toward investments in a variety of commercial projects.\n\nSome complementary currencies take advantage of [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] fees, an intentional devaluation of the currency over time, like negative [[interest]]. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value-holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc., all of which are sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.\n\nOther experimental complementary currencies use high interest fees to promote heavy competition between participants, and the removal of wealth from long term wealth holding structures (natural/material wealth, property, etc.) to aid in the process of rapid industrialization, mass production, automation and competitive innovation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nMonetary speculation and gambling are usually outside the design parameters of complementary currencies. Complementary currencies are often intentionally restricted in their regional spread, time of validity or sector of use and may require a membership of participating individuals or points of acceptance.\n\nThere are some complementary currencies that are regional or global, such as the [[Community Exchange System]], [[WIR]] and Friendly Favors, Tibex in the [[Lazio]] region in Italy or the proposed global currency [[Terra (currency)|terra]].{{r|rietaer}}\n\nA [[community currency]] is a type of complementary currency that has the explicit aim to support and build more equal, connected and sustainable societies. A community currency is designed to be used by a specific group.{{r|CCIA}}\n\n==Activists==\nSome complementary currency activists are Belgian ex-banker [[Bernard Lietaer]], British economist Hazel Henderson, Dutch STRO-director [[Henk van Arkel]] that developed [[Cyclos]], [[Qoin]] initiators [[Edgar Kampers]] and [[Rob van Hilten]], [[Paul Glover (activist)|Paul Glover]] of Ithaca HOURS, [[Margrit Kennedy]] from Monneta, [[Local exchange trading system|LETSystem]] inventor [[Michael Linton]], [[Time Banking]] inventor [[Edgar S. Cahn]], [[Complementary Currency Resource Center]] coordinator [[Stephen DeMeulenaere]] and many others. Lietaer has argued that the world's national currencies are inadequate for the world's business needs, citing how 87 countries have experienced major currency crashes over a 20-year period, and arguing for complementary currencies as a way to protect against these problems.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21825746_ITM \"Bernard Lietaer Urges the Growth of New

The [[Miracle of W\u00f6rgl]] is an event that showed the potential of this increased spending through the introduction of a local currency known as [[Freigeld]]. Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the [[money]] always keeps circulating locally, benefiting only the local economy.\n\nAlternative currencies are reported to work as a counterbalance for the local economy. They increase in activity if the local economy slows down, and decrease in activity if the local economy goes up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stodder|first=James|title=Implications for Macroeconomic Stability|url=http://www.lietaer.com/images/Stodder_Reciprocal_Exchange.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=January 2005}}</ref>{{Dubious|No mention of alternative currency|reason=No mention of alternative currency|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs a commercial tool within a business, as opposed to a geographical social tool, a complementary currency can open a business up to a preferred source marketplace whereby they can sell their otherwise devalued or worthless spare capacity in exchange for the complementary currency. By selling their spare capacity (empty hotel rooms / under utilised staff hours / blank diary slots / excess stock) the business is able to harness the otherwise lost value gaining some key benefits such as :- Improved profits; stronger balance sheet; enhanced cash flow; more customers and a growth in market share.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nAlternative currencies promoted as [[local currencies]] which cannot be spent outside the community have limited use.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAccording to professor Nikolaus L\u00e4ufer, the use of local currencies such as Freigeld can only increase economic activity temporarily. Lengthy use of a local currency will ultimately result in a decline in economic activity and lead to a destabilization of the economy. This is due to the increased circulation velocity of the money as the amount in circulation decreases (as currencies as Freigeld reduce in value rapidly).<ref>{{cite web|last=L\u00e4ufer|first=Nikolaus|title=Natural Economic Order Theories or Freiwirtschaftslehre (Silvio Gesell)|url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/wiwi/laufer/main.html#FREI|publisher=University of Konstanz|accessdate=3 April 2014||date= 31 December 2006|language=German}}</ref>{{ clarify | date = June 2015 | reason = More specific link required}}\n\n==Tax==\n{{Expand section|section=2|date=May 2019}}\nOften there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax-status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\n==Types==\nComplementary currencies describe a wide group of exchange systems, currencies or [[scrip]]s designed to be used in combination with standard currencies or other complementary currencies. They can be valued and exchanged in relationship to national currencies but also function as [[Medium of exchange|media of exchange]] on their own. Complementary currencies lie outside the nationally defined legal realm of [[legal tender]] and are not used as such. Rate of exchange, scope of circulation and use in combination with other currencies differs greatly between complementary currency systems, as is the case with national currency systems.\n\n[[File:Freigeld1.jpg|thumb|One [[W\u00f6rgl]] Schilling note with [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] stamps]]\nSome complementary currencies incorporate value scales based on time or the backing of real resources (gold, oil, services, etc.). A [[time-based currency]] is valued by the time required to perform a service in hours, notwithstanding the potential market value of the service. Another type of complementary monetary systems is the barter, an exchange of specific goods or services is performed without the use of any currency.\n\nIn 1982, the most widespread auxiliary currency system, the [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]], was created. It regulates the exchange of goods and services between the members of the cooperative. Examples for an investment system of complementary currency are the Automatic Social Financial Network (ASFN) and the international [[crowdsourcing]] and [[crowd-funding]] community Evolution RA<ref>http://asfn.info/en/</ref> whose members use their own complementary virtual currency \"\u0421yber-gold\". The introductory fee paid by the new association members is subsequently directed toward investments in a variety of commercial projects.\n\nSome complementary currencies take advantage of [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] fees, an intentional devaluation of the currency over time, like negative [[interest]]. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value-holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc., all of which are sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.\n\nOther experimental complementary currencies use high interest fees to promote heavy competition between participants, and the removal of wealth from long term wealth holding structures (natural/material wealth, property, etc.) to aid in the process of rapid industrialization, mass production, automation and competitive innovation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nMonetary speculation and gambling are usually outside the design parameters of complementary currencies. Complementary currencies are often intentionally restricted in their regional spread, time of validity or sector of use and may require a membership of participating individuals or points of acceptance.\n\nThere are some complementary currencies that are regional or global, such as the [[Community Exchange System]], [[WIR]] and Friendly Favors, Tibex in the [[Lazio]] region in Italy or the proposed global currency [[Terra (currency)|terra]].{{r|rietaer}}\n\nA [[community currency]] is a type of complementary currency that has the explicit aim to support and build more equal, connected and sustainable societies. A community currency is designed to be used by a specific group.{{r|CCIA}}\n\n==Activists==\nSome complementary currency activists are Belgian ex-banker [[Bernard Lietaer]], British economist Hazel Henderson, Dutch STRO-director [[Henk van Arkel]] that developed [[Cyclos]], [[Qoin]] initiators [[Edgar Kampers]] and [[Rob van Hilten]], [[Paul Glover (activist)|Paul Glover]] of Ithaca HOURS, [[Margrit Kennedy]] from Monneta, [[Local exchange trading system|LETSystem]] inventor [[Michael Linton]], [[Time Banking]] inventor [[Edgar S. Cahn]], [[Complementary Currency Resource Center]] coordinator [[Stephen DeMeulenaere]] and many others. Lietaer has argued that the world's national currencies are inadequate for the world's business needs, citing how 87 countries have experienced major currency crashes over a 20-year period, and arguing for complementary currencies as a way to protect against these problems.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21825746_ITM \"Bernard Lietaer Urges the Growth of New

He had a long association with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], spanning more than sixty years as a player, manager and club ambassador. McNeill captained Celtic's '[[Lisbon Lions]]' to their [[European Cup]] victory in [[1967 European Cup Final|1967]] and later spent two spells as the club's manager. As a player and manager, he won 31 major trophies with Celtic.\n\nA defender, McNeill played for Celtic for his entire senior career, and holds the club record for most appearances, a total of 822 games over 18 seasons. He was captain during their most successful era in the 1960s and 70s. The club won nine consecutive [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championships]] and thirteen other major domestic trophies in this time, and in 1967 became the first British club to win the European Cup. He also played 29 times for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].\n\nMcNeill managed Celtic for nine seasons, from 1978 to 1983 and 1987 to 1991, winning four Scottish league championships. This included a league and cup double in 1987\u201388, the club's centenary season. He also managed [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. In 2015, Celtic installed a statue outside [[Celtic Park]] of McNeill holding aloft the European Cup, an iconic image in their history.\n\n==Early life==\nMcNeill was born on 2 March 1940 in [[Bellshill]], [[Lanarkshire]]. His father was a soldier in the [[Black Watch]] and later the [[Army Physical Training Corps]]. Aged nine, McNeill moved to [[Hereford]] in England where his father was posted, and stayed for two and a half years.

player and [[manager (association football)|manager]]. He had a long association with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], spanning more than sixty years as a player, manager and club ambassador. McNeill captained Celtic's '[[Lisbon Lions]]' to their [[European Cup]] victory in [[1967 European Cup Final|1967]] and later spent two spells as the club's manager. As a player and manager, he won 31 major trophies with Celtic.\n\nA defender, McNeill played for Celtic for his entire senior career, and holds the club record for most appearances, a total of 822 games over 18 seasons. He was captain during their most successful era in the 1960s and 70s. The club won nine consecutive [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championships]] and thirteen other major domestic trophies in this time, and in 1967 became the first British club to win the European Cup. He also played 29 times for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].\n\nMcNeill managed Celtic for nine seasons, from 1978 to 1983 and 1987 to 1991, winning four Scottish league championships. This included a league and cup double in 1987\u201388, the club's centenary season. He also managed [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]], [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. In 2015, Celtic installed a statue outside [[Celtic Park]] of McNeill holding aloft the European Cup, an iconic image in their history.\n\n==Early life==\nMcNeill was born on 2 March 1940 in [[Bellshill]], [[Lanarkshire]]. His father was a soldier in the [[Black Watch]] and later the [[Army Physical Training Corps]]. Aged nine, McNeill moved to [[Hereford]] in England where his father was posted, and stayed for two and a half years.

In 1914 Chapman declared; \"This city is built to support top-flight football\", but Leeds City were forcibly disbanded and forced to sell off all their players by [[The Football League]] in 1919 in response to allegations of illegal payments to players during the First World War. In 1919, Leeds United was formed and they received an invitation to enter the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]], being voted into it on 31 October, taking the place vacated by Leeds City Reserves. Following Leeds City's disbanding, [[Yorkshire Amateur A.F.C.|Yorkshire Amateurs]] bought their stadium Elland Road. Yorkshire Amateurs offered to make way for the new team under the management of former player [[Dick Ray]].\n\nThe chairman of [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Hilton Crowther]] loaned Leeds United \u00a3{{formatnum:35000}}, to be repaid when Leeds United won promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. He brought in [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]'s manager [[Arthur Fairclough (manager)|Arthur Fairclough]] and on 26 February 1920, Dick Ray stepped down to become Fairclough's assistant.\n\n===1920\u20131960: Early years===\n[[File:Leeds United 1920-21.jpg|thumb|left|The first Leeds United team at the start of the 1920\u201321 season]]\n[[File:Leeds United AFC League Performance.svg|thumb| A chart showing the progress of Leeds United through the [[English football league system]]]]\nOn 31 May 1920, Leeds United were elected to the Football League. Over the following few years, they consolidated their position in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and in [[1923\u201324 in English football|1924]] won the title and with it promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They failed to establish themselves and were relegated in [[1926\u201327 in English football|1926\u201327]]. After their relegation, Fairclough resigned, which paved the way for Ray to return as manager. In the years up until the start of World War II Leeds were twice relegated; on both occasions they were re-promoted the following season.\n\nOn 5 March 1935, Ray resigned and was replaced by [[Billy Hampson]], who remained in charge for 12 years. In the [[1946\u201347 in English football|1946\u201347 season]] after the war, Leeds were relegated again, with the worst league record in their history. After this season, Hampson resigned (he stayed with Leeds as their chief scout for eight months) and was replaced in April 1947 by [[Willis Edwards]]. In 1948, Sam Bolton replaced Ernest Pullan as the chairman of Leeds United. Edwards was moved to assistant manager in April 1948 after just one year as manager. He was replaced by [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]].\n\nLeeds remained in the Second Division until [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]], when they once again won promotion to the First Division, inspired by [[John Charles]]. Charles was hungry for success at the highest level, and manager [[Raich Carter]] was unable to convince him that Leeds could satisfy his ambitions. Charles was sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a then world record of \u00a365,000. The loss of Charles resulted in Leeds being relegated to the Second Division in the [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]] season.\n\n===1961\u20131974: Don Revie era===\n[[File:Don Revie statue, Elland Road.jpg|thumb|right|Don Revie statue outside Elland Road]]\nIn March 1961, the club appointed former player [[Don Revie]] as manager, following the resignation of Jack Taylor.

In 1955, Leeds changed again to royal blue shirts with gold collars, white shorts, and blue and yellow hooped socks, thus echoing the original Leeds City strip.<ref name=\"mighty\" /> In 1961, [[Don Revie]] introduced a plain white strip throughout, in the hope of emulating Spanish side [[Real Madrid]].\n\n===Badge===\nLeeds United's first badge appeared in 1934. Like Leeds City before them, the club adopted the [[Coat of arms of Leeds]], which remained on the kit in various guises until 1961.<ref name=\"HFK\">{{Cite web |url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Leeds_United/Leeds_United.htm |title=Leeds United |website=historicalkits.co.uk |publisher=Historical Football Kits |access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref> For a number of seasons after 1961\u201362, when the all-white strip replaced the blue and gold, the shirts sported no badge at all.\n\nA perching owl badge was added to the strip in 1964. The design was a surprise given Revie's superstition about the symbolism of birds. The owl derived from the three owls that feature on the city's coat of arms, which in turn were taken from the coat of arms of Sir John Savile, the first [[alderman]] of Leeds. The owl was usually navy blue, but was coloured gold for the [[1968 Football League Cup Final]].<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nBetween 1971 and 1973, Leeds used the \"LUFC\" script that runs down the centre of the current badge, albeit in a diagonal fashion rather than the present vertical. The script made a reappearance on the 'retro-look' Asics kit used during the 1995\u201396 season.\n\nIn 1973 came the embodiment of 1970s imagery with the iconic \"smiley\" badge, made up of the letters L and U in bubble writing. Revie's predilection for gimmicks was years ahead of its time, and done with the explicit intention of gaining acceptance from a public outside West Yorkshire.<ref name=\"mighty\" />\n\nIn 1977, the smiley badge was rotated through 45\u00b0 and the yellow and blue colours were reversed.\n\nThe yellow smiley returned the following year, but was now enclosed in a circle surrounded by the words \"LEEDS UNITED AFC\".\n\nIn the 1978\u201379 season, a new badge appeared that was similar to that of the previous season, except now the words \"LEEDS UNITED AFC\" enclosed a stylised peacock (a reference to the club's nickname, \"The Peacocks\") rather than the yellow smiley.\n\nIn 1984, another badge was introduced which lasted until 1998, making it the longest lived of the modern era. The distinctive rose and ball badge used the traditional blue, gold and white colours, and incorporated the [[White Rose of York]], the club's name, and a [[Ball (association football)|football]] (a [[truncated icosahedron]] similar to the [[Adidas Telstar]], but in Leeds colours) in the core section.<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, the club logo was replaced with a more \"European\" shield design. The shield retained the white rose, as well as the blue, gold and white colours, with \"LUFC\" reading vertically down the centre.<ref name=\"auto\" /> In 1999, the badge was slightly amended in that the football from the 1984 badge was added to the centre of the white rose.<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nOn 20 February 2019, Leeds United revealed a predominantly gold coloured badge that would be worn on the players' kit during the club's centenary season. The badge retained the existing shield design, but replaced the \"LUFC\" script with the words \"LEEDS UNITED\" above and \"100 YEARS\" below the shield. The crest also carried the date \"1919\", the year that the club was founded, as well as the centenary year \"2019\".\n\n==Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Leeds_United/Leeds_United.htm |title=Leeds United \u2013 Historical Football Kits |website=www.historicalkits.co.uk |access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

In recent years, the magazine was taken out of circulation in newsagents and supermarkets, and so was only available to official club members by mail or by purchase in the official club shop. The magazine ceased publication in 2011.\n\nAfter the takeover by GFH Capital, Leeds introduced a Leeds United official [[Twitter]] feed to help interact via social media.<ref name=\"@LUFC: OFFICIAL TWITTER ACCOUNT\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20121222/over-10000-sign-up-in-24-hours_2247585_3016983 |title=New Twitter account proves popular... |date=22 December 2012 |publisher=Leeds United Official Site |access-date=22 December 2012}}</ref> GFH Capital also expanded the club's [[Facebook]] page and introduced [[Instagram]] accounts and further official [[Twitter]] pages for commercial ventures.

The club also has an official [[Snapchat]] account too.\n\nIn October 2014, it was revealed that Ken Bates-owned radio station [[Radio Yorkshire]] would broadcast Leeds United games, thus sharing broadcasting rights with [[BBC Radio Leeds]] and LUTV for live matchday commentary of all Leeds United first team games.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Marching on Together|Glory Glory Leeds United}}\nIn April 1972, the Leeds squad released a single, 'Leeds United' with the B-side being [[Marching On Together|'Leeds! Leeds! Leeds!']] (commonly known as 'Marching on Together'). It was issued to coincide with the team reaching the [[FA Cup Final 1972|1972 FA Cup Final]]; the vocals on the original recording were by the Leeds team. The record reached number 10 in the [[UK singles chart]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/britishhitsingle0012unse |title=Guinness British Hit Singles 12th Edition |publisher=Guinness Publishing |isbn=0-85112-092-X |url-access=registration}}</ref> After Leeds' promotion back to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] in May 2010, the song was digitally re-mastered and re-released in an effort to get the song into the [[UK Singles Chart]]. By 4&nbsp;pm on Monday, the song was already at eighth in the [[ITunes Store|iTunes]] store charts and top of both the [[Amazon.com]] and [[Play.com]] singles charts. On the [[Official Chart Company]]'s Official Chart Update the song charted at 10 (for the second time in its history) and was the highest new entry apart from [[B.o.B]]'s '[[Nothin' on You]]'. Whilst it is not officially the club anthem, 'Marching on Together' is played before every home game. Unlike many football songs that are just new words set to existing music, 'Leeds Leeds Leeds' is an original composition by [[Les Reed (songwriter)|Les Reed]] and [[Barry Mason]], written especially for Leeds United.\n\nFor many years, 'Strings for Yasmin' by [[Tin Tin Out]] was played before kick-off at Elland Road; it was replaced in the 2008\u201309 season with '[[Eye of the Tiger]]' by [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] and in the 2009\u201310 season with [[Montagues and Capulets|'Dance of the Knights]]', composed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. Currently '[[I Predict a Riot]]' by [[Kaiser Chiefs]] is played before walk-outs: the band are LUFC supporters who named themselves after [[Kaizer Chiefs|the former club]] of Lucas Radebe. 'Nightmare' by [[Brainbug]] is currently played before the start of the second half.\n\n==Players==\n===First-team squad===\n<!----------------------------- READ THIS NOTICE FIRST BEFORE EDITING ----------------------------------\n&nbsp;\u2013 Do ''not'' add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club through their website,\nincluding medical and signing the contract.

At first they found it hard to draw big crowds to [[Elland Road]] but their fortunes improved following [[Herbert Chapman]]'s arrival. In 1914 Chapman declared; \"This city is built to support top-flight football\", but Leeds City were forcibly disbanded and forced to sell off all their players by [[The Football League]] in 1919 in response to allegations of illegal payments to players during the First World War. In 1919, Leeds United was formed and they received an invitation to enter the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]], being voted into it on 31 October, taking the place vacated by Leeds City Reserves. Following Leeds City's disbanding, [[Yorkshire Amateur A.F.C.|Yorkshire Amateurs]] bought their stadium Elland Road. Yorkshire Amateurs offered to make way for the new team under the management of former player [[Dick Ray]].\n\nThe chairman of [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Hilton Crowther]] loaned Leeds United \u00a3{{formatnum:35000}}, to be repaid when Leeds United won promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. He brought in [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]'s manager [[Arthur Fairclough (manager)|Arthur Fairclough]] and on 26 February 1920, Dick Ray stepped down to become Fairclough's assistant.\n\n===1920\u20131960: Early years===\n[[File:Leeds United 1920-21.jpg|thumb|left|The first Leeds United team at the start of the 1920\u201321 season]]\n[[File:Leeds United AFC League Performance.svg|thumb| A chart showing the progress of Leeds United through the [[English football league system]]]]\nOn 31 May 1920, Leeds United were elected to the Football League. Over the following few years, they consolidated their position in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and in [[1923\u201324 in English football|1924]] won the title and with it promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They failed to establish themselves and were relegated in [[1926\u201327 in English football|1926\u201327]]. After their relegation, Fairclough resigned, which paved the way for Ray to return as manager. In the years up until the start of World War II Leeds were twice relegated; on both occasions they were re-promoted the following season.\n\nOn 5 March 1935, Ray resigned and was replaced by [[Billy Hampson]], who remained in charge for 12 years. In the [[1946\u201347 in English football|1946\u201347 season]] after the war, Leeds were relegated again, with the worst league record in their history. After this season, Hampson resigned (he stayed with Leeds as their chief scout for eight months) and was replaced in April 1947 by [[Willis Edwards]]. In 1948, Sam Bolton replaced Ernest Pullan as the chairman of Leeds United. Edwards was moved to assistant manager in April 1948 after just one year as manager. He was replaced by [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Frank Buckley]].\n\nLeeds remained in the Second Division until [[1955\u201356 in English football|1955\u201356]], when they once again won promotion to the First Division, inspired by [[John Charles]]. Charles was hungry for success at the highest level, and manager [[Raich Carter]] was unable to convince him that Leeds could satisfy his ambitions. Charles was sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a then world record of \u00a365,000. The loss of Charles resulted in Leeds being relegated to the Second Division in the [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]] season.\n\n===1961\u20131974: Don Revie era===\n[[File:Don Revie statue, Elland Road.jpg|thumb|right|Don Revie statue outside Elland Road]]\nIn March 1961, the club appointed former player [[Don Revie]] as manager, following the resignation of Jack Taylor.

In 1955, Leeds changed again to royal blue shirts with gold collars, white shorts, and blue and yellow hooped socks, thus echoing the original Leeds City strip.<ref name=\"mighty\" /> In 1961, [[Don Revie]] introduced a plain white strip throughout, in the hope of emulating Spanish side [[Real Madrid]].\n\n===Badge===\nLeeds United's first badge appeared in 1934. Like Leeds City before them, the club adopted the [[Coat of arms of Leeds]], which remained on the kit in various guises until 1961.<ref name=\"HFK\">{{Cite web |url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Leeds_United/Leeds_United.htm |title=Leeds United |website=historicalkits.co.uk |publisher=Historical Football Kits |access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref> For a number of seasons after 1961\u201362, when the all-white strip replaced the blue and gold, the shirts sported no badge at all.\n\nA perching owl badge was added to the strip in 1964. The design was a surprise given Revie's superstition about the symbolism of birds. The owl derived from the three owls that feature on the city's coat of arms, which in turn were taken from the coat of arms of Sir John Savile, the first [[alderman]] of Leeds. The owl was usually navy blue, but was coloured gold for the [[1968 Football League Cup Final]].<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nBetween 1971 and 1973, Leeds used the \"LUFC\" script that runs down the centre of the current badge, albeit in a diagonal fashion rather than the present vertical. The script made a reappearance on the 'retro-look' Asics kit used during the 1995\u201396 season.\n\nIn 1973 came the embodiment of 1970s imagery with the iconic \"smiley\" badge, made up of the letters L and U in bubble writing. Revie's predilection for gimmicks was years ahead of its time, and done with the explicit intention of gaining acceptance from a public outside West Yorkshire.<ref name=\"mighty\" />\n\nIn 1977, the smiley badge was rotated through 45\u00b0 and the yellow and blue colours were reversed.\n\nThe yellow smiley returned the following year, but was now enclosed in a circle surrounded by the words \"LEEDS UNITED AFC\".\n\nIn the 1978\u201379 season, a new badge appeared that was similar to that of the previous season, except now the words \"LEEDS UNITED AFC\" enclosed a stylised peacock (a reference to the club's nickname, \"The Peacocks\") rather than the yellow smiley.\n\nIn 1984, another badge was introduced which lasted until 1998, making it the longest lived of the modern era. The distinctive rose and ball badge used the traditional blue, gold and white colours, and incorporated the [[White Rose of York]], the club's name, and a [[Ball (association football)|football]] (a [[truncated icosahedron]] similar to the [[Adidas Telstar]], but in Leeds colours) in the core section.<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, the club logo was replaced with a more \"European\" shield design. The shield retained the white rose, as well as the blue, gold and white colours, with \"LUFC\" reading vertically down the centre.<ref name=\"auto\" /> In 1999, the badge was slightly amended in that the football from the 1984 badge was added to the centre of the white rose.<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nOn 20 February 2019, Leeds United revealed a predominantly gold coloured badge that would be worn on the players' kit during the club's centenary season. The badge retained the existing shield design, but replaced the \"LUFC\" script with the words \"LEEDS UNITED\" above and \"100 YEARS\" below the shield. The crest also carried the date \"1919\", the year that the club was founded, as well as the centenary year \"2019\".\n\n==Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Leeds_United/Leeds_United.htm |title=Leeds United \u2013 Historical Football Kits |website=www.historicalkits.co.uk |access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The record reached number 10 in the [[UK singles chart]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/britishhitsingle0012unse |title=Guinness British Hit Singles 12th Edition |publisher=Guinness Publishing |isbn=0-85112-092-X |url-access=registration}}</ref> After Leeds' promotion back to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] in May 2010, the song was digitally re-mastered and re-released in an effort to get the song into the [[UK Singles Chart]]. By 4&nbsp;pm on Monday, the song was already at eighth in the [[ITunes Store|iTunes]] store charts and top of both the [[Amazon.com]] and [[Play.com]] singles charts. On the [[Official Chart Company]]'s Official Chart Update the song charted at 10 (for the second time in its history) and was the highest new entry apart from [[B.o.B]]'s '[[Nothin' on You]]'. Whilst it is not officially the club anthem, 'Marching on Together' is played before every home game. Unlike many football songs that are just new words set to existing music, 'Leeds Leeds Leeds' is an original composition by [[Les Reed (songwriter)|Les Reed]] and [[Barry Mason]], written especially for Leeds United.\n\nFor many years, 'Strings for Yasmin' by [[Tin Tin Out]] was played before kick-off at Elland Road; it was replaced in the 2008\u201309 season with '[[Eye of the Tiger]]' by [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] and in the 2009\u201310 season with [[Montagues and Capulets|'Dance of the Knights]]', composed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. Currently '[[I Predict a Riot]]' by [[Kaiser Chiefs]] is played before walk-outs: the band are LUFC supporters who named themselves after [[Kaizer Chiefs|the former club]] of Lucas Radebe. 'Nightmare' by [[Brainbug]] is currently played before the start of the second half.\n\n==Players==\n===First-team squad===\n<!----------------------------- READ THIS NOTICE FIRST BEFORE EDITING ----------------------------------\n&nbsp;\u2013 Do ''not'' add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club through their website,\nincluding medical and signing the contract.

MES provides information that helps manufacturing decision makers understand how current conditions on the plant floor can be optimized to improve production output.<ref>{{cite book | year =  1997 | title = Applying Manufacturing Execution Systems | last = McClellan | first = Michael | location = Boca Raton, Fl | publisher = St. Lucie/APICS | isbn = 1574441353}}</ref> MES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of the production process (e.g. inputs, personnel, machines and support services).\n\nMES may operate across multiple function areas, for example: management of product definitions across the [[Product life-cycle management|product life-cycle]], resource [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], order execution and dispatch, production analysis and downtime management for [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE), product quality, or [[Track and trace|materials track and trace]].

These typically include:.\n* Management of product definitions. This may include storage, version control and exchange with other systems of master data like product production rules, bill of material, bill of resources, process set points and recipe data all focused on defining how to make a product. Management of product definitions can be part of [[product lifecycle management]].\n* Management of resources. This may include registration, exchange and analysis of resource information, aiming to prepare and execute production orders with resources of the right capabilities and availability.\n* [[Scheduling (production processes)]]. These activities determine the production schedule as a collection of work orders to meet the production requirements, typically received from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) or specialized [[advanced planning and scheduling]] systems, making optimal use of local resources.\n* Dispatching production orders. Depending on the type of production processes this may include further distribution of batches, runs and work orders, issuing these to work centers and adjustment to unanticipated conditions.\n* Execution of production orders. Although actual execution is done by [[process control]] systems, an MES may perform checks on resources and inform other systems about the progress of production processes.\n* Collection of production data. This includes collection, storage and exchange of process data, equipment status, material lot information and production logs in either a data historian or relational database.\n* Production performance analysis. Create useful information out of the raw collected data about the current status of production, like Work In Progress (WIP) overviews, and the production performance of the past period like the [[overall equipment effectiveness]] or any other [[performance indicator]].\n* Production [[track and trace]]. Registration and retrieval of related information in order to present a complete history of lots, orders or equipment (particularly important in health related productions, e.g. [[pharmaceuticals]]).\n\n== Relationship with other systems==\n\nMES integrates with ISA-95 (previous [[Enterprise control#ISA95 .E2.80.9Clevels.E2.80.9D for enterprise integration|Purdue Reference Model, \u201c95\u201d]]) with multiple relationships.\n\n===Relationship with other Level 3 systems===\nThe collection of systems acting on the ISA-95 Level 3 can be called manufacturing operations management systems (MOMS). Apart from an MES, there are typically [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS), [[warehouse management system]] (WMS) and [[computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS). From the MES point of view possible information flows are:\n* To LIMS: quality test requests, sample lots, statistical process data\n* From LIMS: quality test results, product certificates, testing progress\n* To WMS: material resource requests, material definitions, product deliveries\n* From WMS: material availability, staged material lots, product shipments\n* To CMMS: equipment running data, equipment assignments, maintenance requests\n* From CMMS: maintenance progress, equipment capabilities, maintenance schedule\n\n===Relationship with Level 4 systems===\nExamples of systems acting on ISA-95 Level 4 are [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[customer relationship management]] (CRM),  [[human resource management]] (HRM), [[process development execution system]] (PDES). From the MES point of view possible information flows are:\n* To PLM: production test results\n* From PLM: product definitions, bill of operations (routings), electronic work instructions, equipment settings\n* To ERP: production performance results, produced and consumed material\n* From ERP: [[production planning]], order requirements\n* To CRM: product tracking and tracing information\n* From CRM: product complaints\n* To HRM: personnel performance\n* From HRM: personnel skills, personnel availability\n* To PDES: production test and execution results\n* From  PDES: manufacturing flow definitions, [[design of experiments]] (DoE) definitions\n\nIn many cases, [[middleware]] [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI) systems are being used to exchange transaction messages between MES and Level 4 systems. A common data definition, [[B2MML]], has been defined within the [[ISA-95]] standard to link MES systems to these Level 4 systems.\n\n===Relationship with Level 0, 1, 2 systems===\nSystems acting on ISA-95 Level 2 are [[supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA), [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC), [[distributed control system]]s (DCS) and [[Batch production|batch automation system]]s (BAS). Information flows between MES and these process control systems are roughly similar:\n* To PLCs: work instructions, recipes, set points\n* From PLCs: process values, alarms, adjusted set points, production results\n\nMost MES systems include connectivity as part of their product offering. Direct communication of plant floor equipment data is established by connecting to the PLC. Often, plant floor data is first collected and diagnosed for real-time control in a DCS or SCADA system. In this case, the MES systems connect to these Level 2 systems for exchanging plant floor data.\n\nUntil recently, the industry standard for plant floor connectivity has been [[OLE for Process Control]] (OPC), but it is now moving to [[OPC Unified Architecture]] (OPC-UA); meaning that OPC-UA compatible systems will not necessarily run only on [[Microsoft Windows]] environment, but will also be able to run on [[Linux|GNU/Linux]] or other embedded systems, decreasing the cost of SCADA systems, and rendering them more open with robust security.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Enterprise control]]\n* [[Enterprise integration]]\n* [[Laboratory information system]]\n* [[Manufacturing operations management]]\n* [[Process development execution system]]\n* [[Product lifecycle management]]\n* [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!--\n*{{cite book | year =  | title =\n | last =\n | first =\n | location =\n | publisher =\n | isbn =\n}} -->\n* {{cite book | year = 2009 | title = MES guide for executives: why and how to select, implement, and maintain a manufacturing execution system | last = Scholten | first = Bianca | location = Research Triangle Park, NC | publisher = International Society of Automation | isbn = 9781936007035 }}\n* [http://mescenter.org '' MES Center Association''], MES Center is a non-profit organization that provides information and trends to those who are interested in control and monitoring of production processes, detailed scheduling, production logistics, production quality management and maintenance from the perspective of MES / MOM information systems\n* [https://slidex.tips/download/the-benefits-of-mes-from-the-field ''The Benefits of MES: A Report from the Field''], Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association\n* {{cite book | year = 2000 | title = Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 1: Models and Terminology\n | location = Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA\n | publisher = International Society of Automation\n | isbn = 1556177275 }}\n* {{cite book | year = 2005 | title = Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 3: Activity Models of Manufacturing Operations Management\n | location = Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA\n | publisher = International Society of Automation\n | isbn = 1556179553 }}\n* ''A Reference Model For Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)'' Purdue Research Foundation, 1989\n\n[[Category:Information systems]]\n[[Category:MES software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|computerized systems used to track and document the manufacturing process}}\n'''Manufacturing execution systems''' ('''MES''') are [[information technology|computerized]] systems used in [[manufacturing]] to track and document the transformation of raw materials to finished goods.
