The recording of the album was the second and last time that Sparks worked with Mack.\n\n== Release ==\n''Angst in My Pants'' was not a success in the UK but was as successful as their former album, ''[[Whomp That Sucker]]'', in the US.

The album was released by [[Atlantic Records]] in both the US and UK, and this was the 6th overall label that the band was signed to in the US, and, for the first time since the mid-1970s, the band would be signed the same label in both the US and UK for 3 consecutive albums.\n\n== History ==\n''Angst in My Pants'' marked the second occasion that [[Ron Mael]] and [[Russell Mael]] worked with the backing band of guitarist Bob Haag, bassist [[Leslie Bohem]], and drummer David Kendrick. Additionally James Goodwin augmented the line up playing synthesizers, though these were mixed farther back, letting the rest of the band come to the fore. The resulting [[power pop]]<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> album was recorded at [[Musicland_Studios | Musicland Studios]], Munich, produced by [[Reinhold Mack|Mack]] in association with Giorgio Moroder Enterprises. The recording of the album was the second and last time that Sparks worked with Mack.\n\n== Release ==\n''Angst in My Pants'' was not a success in the UK but was as successful as their former album, ''[[Whomp That Sucker]]'', in the US. It reached #173 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5494/charts-awards/billboard-albums|pure_url=yes}} | title=Allmusic - Billboard Albums - Sparks| publisher=Billboard| accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref>\n\nThe single \"[[I Predict]]\" became Sparks' first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] reaching #60 in May 1982.<ref name=allmusic/> This was the first time since the release of \"Wonder Girl\" in 1971 that Sparks had enjoyed moderate success on the US single charts. An extended remix of \"I Predict\" was released as a club promo while the 7\" single was backed with the album track \"Moustache\". The video for \"I Predict\" was directed by Douglas Brian Martin, cinematography by [[Frederick Elmes]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2361068|pure_url=yes}}| title=allmusic - I Predict - Sparks| publisher=\u00a9 2009 Macrovision Corporation.

Another film, ''[[Hitman: Agent 47]]'' was released in 2015, also to negative reviews.\n\nThe games revolve around [[Agent 47]], a cloned [[contract killer]], whose flawless record places him in high demand among the wealthy and elite, as he assassinates numerous high-profile criminals across the globe. The first original scriptwriter was Morten Iversen, who wrote the scripts for ''Hitman: Codename 47'' and ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin''. He also contributed to ''Hitman: Contracts'' and ''Hitman: Blood Money''. The games feature a mix of orchestral and [[electronica]] musical scores, composed by [[Jesper Kyd]]. A fifth installment of the series, ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'', was released on 20 November 2012. With it, a spin-off has been released for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 called ''Hitman: Sniper Challenge''. For mobile and tablet, a spin-off game developed by [[Square Enix Montreal]] was released as a turn-based strategy game, titled ''[[Hitman Go]]''.

After a year, he is shown to be working for the covert International Contract Agency, or ICA, under his handler Diana Burnwood. He is sent on a mission to eliminate four crime bosses across the world, before being hired to kill a fifth target, Doctor Kovacs, at the sanitarium where 47 was imprisoned. As events transpire, 47 finds out that all his targets were part of an advanced cloning experiment, with him as the result; the perfect assassin. Professor Ort-Meyer, himself the scientific head of the experiments, is revealed to be the client who ordered the hits and, to protect himself, sends a squad of docile, highly trained 48 clones against 47. With help from a fellow agent, 47 defeats the clones and kills Ort-Meyer. In the aftermath of this revelation, 47 tries to leave his assassin past behind (in ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]''), seeking peace in a Sicilian monastery, but is forced to become an assassin when his mentor and friend, Father Vittorio, is kidnapped. Getting back in contact with the ICA, he arranges with Diana that he will work for them if they help trace Father Vittorio. Eventually, it is revealed that Father Vittorio's kidnapping was orchestrated by Sergei Zavorotko, the brother of one of the men whose DNA helped create 47, to bring 47 out of retirement and kill everyone who was in on a deal by Zavorotko to purchase a nuclear warhead. 47 successfully infiltrates Father Vittorio's monastery, killing Zavorotko and all his men. Though Father Vittorio begs 47 to lead a good life, the assassin decides to return to the ICA full-time.\n\nA few years later, 47's reputation has spread far and wide with a list of clients requesting his services. After an operation in [[Paris]] [[France]], 47 himself is nearly killed, prompting [[Hitman: Contracts|flashbacks over previous missions]]. In ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', it emerges that the ICA is under attack from a rival agency called the Franchise, who are planting incriminating evidence against 47 through one of their agents, Alexander Leland Cayne. Eventually, the agency is depleted to the point that Diana and 47 are the only ones left. 47 kills one of the two Franchise assassins and is given a final contract by Diana, who has dissolved the ICA, to take down the Franchise. Soon, an old acquaintance of 47, former CIA agent Smith, reveals that the Franchise, planning to assassinate the US president, is merely a puppet organization for Alpha Xerox, a shadowy political organization who wish to monopolize the cloning techniques that gave birth to 47: they wish to kill the President before he can put a halt to their plans. 47 prevents the assassination, but must go into hiding from the Franchise and the police. At his hideout, he is seemingly betrayed and poisoned by Diana, with the Franchise preparing to cremate the assassin so his DNA cannot be used for further cloning experiments. 47's 'death' is later revealed to be a tactic which would bring 47 within killing range of everyone at the funeral, including Franchise agent Cayne. 47, his identity now a secret, goes into hiding and Diana uses the remains of the Franchise to revive the ICA.\n\nYears later, in ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'', Diana seemingly betrays the ICA, exposing it to the public. When the Agency learns of her betrayal, they send operatives to eliminate her. During a mission, Diana is forced to suddenly abandon 47 when she sees that the Agency operatives are coming for her. Due to her sudden disconnection from him, 47 is nearly killed during the mission and decides to cut contact with the ICA. The Agency is eventually able to locate 47 once again. Benjamin Travis, who is Diana's superior within the Agency, contracts him to kill Diana and bring a girl she has in her care, Victoria, to the Agency. 47 infiltrates Diana's base and shoots her, but promises to keep Victoria safe from the ICA. It is revealed that Victoria is a clone, like 47, created in secret by Travis, whom the ICA would train to be an assassin. Diana did what she did to protect the girl from becoming like 47. The assassin soon comes into conflict with Blake Dexter, the head of Dexter Industries and a top figure in the criminal underworld, who wishes to sell Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 finds himself fighting to keep Victoria safe as she is hunted by Dexter's forces and the ICA. 47 eventually kills Dexter and his conspirators along with Travis and his lieutenants, saving Victoria. At the end, it is revealed that 47 spared Diana and it is implied that she and 47 are once more working for the ICA.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', the game's prologue reveals 47's recruitment into the ICA and his first meeting with Diana. While Diana is impressed with 47's skills as a silent assassin, training director Erich Soders believes that 47 is too dangerous as they could find nothing on his background check that gives the ICA any leverage over him. Soders rigs 47's final test so that it would be impossible to complete on his own, although Diana learns of Soders plot and in turn assists 47 in completing the test. Though angered by Diana's actions, Soders reluctantly makes 47 an agent and assigns Diana as his handler. Twenty years later, following the events of the previous game, 47 is sent to Paris to eliminate fashion mogul Viktor Novikov and his partner Dahlia Margolis, who are secretly the ring leaders of the international spy ring IAGO. After completing the contract he is sent to Sapienza, [[Italy]] to eliminate the wealthy bioengineer Silvio Caruso and his Head of Lab Francesca DeSantis who both work for the Ether Bio Corporation and to destroy a genetically engineered virus that targets an individual unique DNA signature. Later, 47 is sent to [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]] to eliminate Claus Strandberg and General Zeydan, who are planning to overthrow the Moroccan government. A contract is then issued on an assumed murderer, Jordan Cross and his family's lawyer Ken Morgan in [[Bangkok]]. Diana then reveals that there's been a \u201cshadow client\u201d the entire time, operating out of [[Colorado]]. 47 proceeds to eliminate the lieutenants of the shadow client and discovers evidence that he has been using 47 to hunt members of Providence, a group of global elites who rule the world in secret. 47 also discovers that Erich Soders is a Providence double agent. Realizing his betrayal, 47 is sent to Hokkaido to eliminate Soders and another Providence operative, Yuki Yamazaki. The final cutscene of season 1 shows a Providence operative discussing a partnership with the ICA to track down the shadow client.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|Hitman 2]]'', 47 is sent to New Zealand to kill Alma Reynard, one of the Shadow Client's lieutenants, and search her house for information on the Shadow Client. 47 receives information connecting CEO of Kronstadt Industries, Robert Knox, and his daughter, Sierra Knox, to the Shadow Client, and Providence, impressed with their work, authorizes them to eliminate the rest of the Shadow Client's militia, as their attacks on CEOs are causing a global panic. 47 is then sent to Miami to kill the Knoxes, who defected from Providence to the Shadow Client after becoming paranoid about the attacks. After they have been eliminated, the Shadow Client is revealed as Lucas Grey, who attempts to fulfill his own plans along with hacktivist Olivia Hall and insists that they need 47's help to take down Providence. 47 is then sent to Colombia to assassinate drug kingpin Rico Delgado and two other members of the infamous Delgado cartel. After the mission, Diana has flashbacks of her parents being killed in a car bombing. It is revealed that the cartel had been creating fake IDs for the Shadow Client's militia, and 47 is sent to Mumbai to find and eliminate The Maelstrom, the Shadow Client's second lieutenant, as well as two other sea pirates that killed a Providence operative. Grey's location is traced to Romania at the facility where 47 was created. 47 encounters Grey, who reveals himself as Subject 6. As children, he and 47 had attempted to escape Dr. Ort-Meyer's facility, but only Grey succeeded, and 47 had his memory wiped. 47 then remembers that he and 6 made a pact that they would take revenge on whoever made them into assassins, and this prompts a meeting between 47, Grey, Diana, and Hall in Berlin. Grey reveals that Ort-Meyer was a member of Providence which is controlled by \"The Constant\" and three families known as \"The Partners\". Grey's only lead on the Constant is that 47 knows the identity of the Constant. After being injected with the antidote to the memory wiping drug, 47 reveals that the first Constant is an ex-KGB spy named Janus who currently resides in a quiet Vermont suburb. Diana then files a false ICA report claiming Janus is the Shadow Client and that Grey is just a subordinate, giving 47 permission to infiltrate the suburban town and kill Janus and his top bodyguard, Nolan Cassidy, and to search for clues about the Constant's whereabouts. While in Vermont, 47 finds evidence Janus and the Constant were planning to meet at an annual gathering held by a group of the global elite known as \"The Ark Society\" that has ties to Providence. Hall reveals that the gathering is being held on the Isle of Sgail in the North Atlantic, but the Constant, revealed as the man who hired Diana at the end of ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', has implanted himself with a suicide chip that releases lethal poison into his body if he is compromised. 47 is then tasked to eliminate Zoe and Sophia Washington, the chairwomen of The Ark Society who hold the kill-switches for the poison chip, and to assist Grey in extracting the Constant from the island. The game leaves off with the Constant revealing the names of the Partner families and by taunting Diana about what she does not know. In a cutscene, it is revealed that 47 was the one contracted with killing Diana's parents.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSet mainly in a third-person perspective, the core objective in each level of the games is to kill assigned targets (usually multiple and sometimes additional targets as an optional bonus). In most cases, ''Hitman'' allows the player different options to accomplish this task. Players can perform precise assassinations or slaughter indiscriminately in order to achieve the mission goals; however, the games reward a subtle approach by awarding special weapons or cash bonuses if players earn a favourable rank (usually achievable by eliminating only the assigned target, and without raising the alarm doing so). 47 can wear a variety of disguises (such as repairmen, police officers and waiters) to fool enemies and gain access to restricted areas. The focus of ''Hitman'' is not hiding in the shadows from the enemy, but rather blending in amongst them. It is up to the player to initiate violence, since guards do not usually open fire unless provoked.\n\nIn every game, the player character, Agent 47, has limited maneuverability; he cannot jump, scale walls, or mantle up ledges (there are a few pre-scripted places where he can jump from one balcony to another, but these are very rare). This generally limits the player to a single plane of movement, although he is often presented the opportunity to move to higher or lower areas through the use of ladders, stairs, elevators, or hills.\n\nAgent 47 is given the ability to hop over minor obstructions in  ''Codename 47'', and other subsequent installments. In the fourth installment, ''Blood Money'', he is now able to climb certain edifices (such as fencing, vines, loose bricks, crates etc.) and is also given with the option of climbing onto the top of elevators through the hatch, allowing the player to strangle a victim from above.\n\nA major feature in the game is the tension meter or \"Suspicion Meter\", detailing how much attention or suspicion the player is receiving from the public or guards and is dependent on many things. For example, walking around in a guard's uniform with the correct corresponding gun will not gather much notice, whereas running around in a waiter's uniform in a restricted area while carrying a visible weapon instead of an appetizer tray will result in an unwanted confrontation with the guards.\n\nThe second game of the series, ''Silent Assassin'', enforced the concept of kills without firing more than a single shot. As per the number of shots fired and stealth used, ratings were given after every mission. The best of these ratings was Silent Assassin, indicating no more than one shot per target (and a guard) with no alerts raised.\n\nIn most cases, 47 is required to hide any dead bodies, to prevent alarms. As introduced in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 can hide a body in a place such as a garbage dump/rubbish bin. Many targets can be assassinated without firing a single shot; this style of gameplay became more prevalent in ''Blood Money'', where the focus was to make some of 47's hits look like accidents. Accidents can be caused remotely with RU-AP mines acting on some (usually heavy and suspended) object, directly by pushing someone over a railing, and by other, more elaborate methods such as:\n* Replacing a World War I replica gun to be used in the opera ''[[Tosca]]'' with a real World War I era pistol.\n* Crushing a man's neck using weights during his morning workout.\n* Rigging a grill to set a victim on fire.\n\n===Methods of assassination===\nThe ''Hitman'' series permits the player to kill targets (or non-targets) in a variety of ways, using firearms, melee weapons, or conventional objects that 47 picks up (such as shovels, fireplace pokers, pool cues, etc.).  In ''Hitman: Contracts'', melee weapons such as knives can be used to kill in more than one method, including forward stabs, horizontal throat slitting, frontal slashes, repeated stabs under the ribcage, or thrusting the blade into the carotid artery.\n\n47 also has a [[garrote]], or fiber wire. The fiber wire is specially made for strangulation, with reinforced handles. He carries it with him on every mission, even those in which he is stripped of all other weaponry. It is also one of the few weapons which can bypass metal detectors.\n\nTo achieve the ideal 'Silent Assassin' rank, it is required that 47 only kills his assigned targets, and few or no other NPCs. The sedative syringes, or chloroform in ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (which only has a temporary, dose-dependent effect, unlike syringes), exist for this purpose, so that 47 may incapacitate an innocent person to take items or clothing from their body without harming them, so it does not count against the player in the final ranking. In ''Blood Money'', the ability to add sedatives to food and drink was added, to avoid direct confrontation. ''Blood Money'' also introduced the option to hold any NPC hostage using smaller arms and use them as a human shield, and allows the player to knock the hostage unconscious with the gun, saving the player sedatives for food items or any impeding characters that are seated in chairs. In some missions, if a murder can be made to look like accidental death (using the accident system introduced in ''Blood Money''), some kills will not be counted as hits, but as accidents.  Any civilians or armed personnel who witness a kill will count as witnesses, and will harm the player's rank if they remain alive or alert nearby guards. If however, someone (target or civilian) dies because of an accident, it will not matter if there are witnesses. 47 has the option of killing witnesses before they reach a guard, but the unnecessary murder will still count against his rank, unless he kills them with an accident.  Witnesses also include anybody who sees 47 changing disguises or holding a weapon. In the games prior to ''Blood Money'', the only consequence of having witnesses to a crime is that they will seek out police/guards and trigger an alert.\n\nThere are mission-specific options for killing a target in certain levels. Notable examples include locking a target in a sauna to stimulate a heart condition and cause cardiac arrest, poisoning a target's meal (this becomes more widespread in ''Blood Money''), disguising 47 as a doctor and sabotaging a surgical operation, replacing a prop [[Mauser C96]] handgun with a real one at an opera rehearsal, causing an actor to unwittingly kill the target, and causing stage pyrotechnics to explode and set the target on fire.\n\nIn most cases, it is required that 47 also hide the body of killed or unconscious victims, in order to avoid any unwanted alarm or if this is the desired effect 47 can leave the victims body in a wide open space for all to see.\n\n===''Hitman'' insignia===\n\nThe ''Hitman'' insignia, a stylized [[fleur de lis]], appears in ''Hitman: Codename 47'' on the gates of Prof. Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's asylum, throughout his laboratory and is formed by Ort-Meyer's pool of blood when 47 kills him at the end of the game. It also appears in 'Hitman: Contracts' on the floor of the cloning lab, this time as though it is the actual floor design, as well as on Ort-Meyer's belt buckle. In ''Blood Money'', it appears on books throughout the levels as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe symbol is engraved on the handles of his custom [[AMT Hardballer]] pistol; they are referred to as 'Silverballers' in ''Hitman: Contracts'', ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Absolution''. After ''Hitman: Contracts'', the symbol is on the slides as well. It is also found on 47's equipment such as his laptop, briefcase and cell phone. In the film, 47 wears a pair of silver cufflinks with his insignia enameled in red.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Agent 47]]''': A genetically-engineered assassin created from the [[recombinant DNA]] of five of the world's most dangerous criminals. The fact that the DNA came from multiple ethnicities allows 47 to blend in to a certain degree in most places in the world, or at least not look immediately suspicious and out-of-place. His name comes from the last two digits of a bar code on the back of his head \u2013 640509-040147. According to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'', Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |title=Hitman 2 Interview \u2013 ( Review, Preview, Article, Interview, Q&A ) |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002754/http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies,\" and other similar media.<ref name=\"PC Int.\">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |title=GamesRadar+ |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919132927/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |archivedate=19 September 2009}}</ref> According to game director Rasmus H\u00f8jengaard, the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the ''Hitman'' team.<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> H\u00f8jengaard felt the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning \"evolved with the character before the first ''Hitman'' game was done\".<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> [[David Bateson]] has voiced 47 in every ''Hitman'' game to date.\n* '''Diana Burnwood''': 47's handler at the Agency. Diana briefs 47 on his assignments, oversees his progress, and serves as his guide over the radio. For the vast majority of the series, 47 never sees Diana, recognising her only by voice, however, they do come face-to-face at the conclusion of ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Contracts''. Although Diana usually handles 47's affairs from afar, she turns out to be a major character in ''Hitman: Blood Money''; serving as a double agent, faking 47's death, saving the Agency from liquidation, and dodging death herself a few times.<ref>'''Diana:''' You and I are all that's left of the Agency 47, and I doubt I'll last much longer. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman: Blood Money'' ([[United States]]) 26 May 2006</ref> In the end, her efforts pay off when the Agency is brought back online.<ref>'''Diana:''' Yes, your Majesty, almost all of our resources are online again. ''Hitman: Blood Money'' ([[United States]]) 26 May 2006</ref>  In ''Hitman:  Absolution'', she is shot by 47 in her home after betraying the agency. Although presumed dead, it is later revealed that 47 had only non-lethally wounded Diana, allowing her to fake her own death. She returns as 47's handler with the ICA in [[Hitman (2016 video game)|the 2016 Hitman]] game. She also presumably continues to care for Victoria, a young girl that she and 47 both rescued from the ICA and other captors. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|2007 Hitman film]], Diana's only form of contact with 47 is through a synthesized voice via laptop. However, she does directly call 47 by phone in order to warn him that the Organization has targeted him. In [[Hitman: Agent 47]], Diana is portrayed by [[Angelababy]]. Diana is voiced by Vivienne McKee from Hitman: Codename 47 until Hitman: Blood Money, Marsha Thomason in Hitman: Absolution and Jane Perry in Hitman\u2122.\n* '''Agent Carlton Smith''': A fairly inept American [[CIA]] agent with ties to the Agency. He has a tendency to be captured and [[torture]]d by the people he has been assigned to spy on. As a result, the Agency has sent 47 to rescue him on a number of occasions. His torture experiences have caused him to take up drinking on the job, making him even more ineffective. Like 47, Agent Smith dons a variety of disguises, but most often he's seen beaten and stripped down to his American Flag [[boxer shorts]]. He seems to regard 47 as a friend, no doubt because 47 has rescued him so many times.  The feeling is not mutual. 47 initially treats his relationship with Agent Smith as detached and professional, but as he is forced to rescue Smith again and again, he increasingly sees Smith as a hindrance. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 puts a gun to Smith's head and threatens to kill him, but in the end didn't as Smith provides him a job which will then lead to the White House assassination. Smith's appearance changes somewhat in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', having lost most of his hair through long term alcoholism and depression. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|Hitman film]], Smith is instead portrayed as a very competent and dutiful CIA agent. In return for assassinating a high priority CIA target (Udre Belicoff, the brother of 47's original target), Smith helps 47 elude arrest by [[Interpol]].\n* '''Mei-Ling''': A young woman from the Chinese mainland, abducted and recruited into the brothel of Hong Kong crime lord Lee Hong. 47 rescues her in exchange for information about her employer in preparation for assassinating him.<ref>'''Mei Ling:''' You foreigner. Then you understand. Listen, you have to help me, please. They kidnapped me and then they brought me here... [...] First you have to get me out of here and then the combination is yours. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman: Contracts'' 20 April 2004 (''[[United States|US]]'')</ref> After escaping from Lee Hong, Mei-Ling is later revealed to be prostituting herself to Hayamoto, another [[Asia]]n crime lord.  47 ends up rescuing her again (much to his consternation).<ref>'''47:''' Still living a lousy life I see. I save you from Lee Hong and his Triad outfit in Hong Kong, and first thing after that mess, you're in it with another hotshot crimelord! '''Mei Ling:''' Well, I don't mind. The hours are short and the pay is good. But he is just an old rich bastard and I am bored now. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' 10 January 2002 (''[[United States|US]]'')</ref> Mei-Ling is apparently the first woman who has ever kissed 47; his reaction is different in the original game from the remake. In the original ''Hitman: Codename 47'', 47 reacts with significant revulsion.  In the remake ''Hitman: Contracts'', his reaction is one of detached bemusement. She was known as Lei Ling in the original game.\n* '''Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer''': 47's creator and the ultimate antagonist of ''Hitman: Codename 47''. A brilliant but unhinged individual ostracized by the scientific community for his radical theories on genetic manipulation, Ort-Meyer ran a sophisticated lab hidden beneath a Romanian asylum. There he labored on DNA splicing in an effort to create a flawless human being. He took a great part in raising and indoctrinating 47 at the asylum, where 47 was kept a prisoner until he matured. Ort-Meyer eventually engineered 47's \"escape\" from the asylum in order to test his performance in the real world. The consummate megalomaniac, Ort-Meyer contracted with the Agency to have 47 kill the other 4 men behind the Hitman Project (47's \"fathers\"), so that Ort-Meyer could enjoy the fruits of his labor by himself. Ort-Meyer then attempted to lure 47 to his death, having perfected \"No. 48\", an improved, mindlessly loyal clone. However, Ort-Meyer underestimated how far 47 had advanced. In the final showdown, 47 slaughtered 48 and the clones, then killed Ort-Meyer himself by snapping his neck.\n\n==Games==\nAs of 2019, seven games had been released, all of them developed by [[IO Interactive]].

(2000)====\n{{main|Hitman: Codename 47}}\nThe first installment in the ''Hitman'' series revolves around a test subject known as 47 escaping the asylum where he had been experimented on all his life and being employed by the Agency. 47 meets his handler, Diana Burnwood, who assigns him to kill four criminal masterminds and then a doctor who is revealed to be the one who treated 47 at the asylum. 47 learns that he is a clone who has been trained since birth to become an assassin. The four criminal masterminds that 47 killed were part of the cloning experiment and their deaths were ordered by Professor Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, the one behind the entire cloning process. Ort-Meyer planned 47's escape, so he could have 47 kill the other four associates and use 47 for his own purposes. 47, with the help of a CIA agent named Carlton Smith, returns to the asylum and plans to kill his creator. Ort-Meyer, having prepared for 47's return, sends his group of clones to kill 47. The clones fail their duties and 47 confronts Ort-Meyer. 47 shoots Ort-Meyer, then snaps his neck, killing him.\n\n====''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (2002)====\n{{main|Hitman 2: Silent Assassin}}\nAfter murdering Dr. Ort-Meyer, Agent 47 has faked his death and unofficially resigned from the ICA, leaving behind his life as an assassin, and retreated to a church in Sicily to seek peace. He works as a gardener for Father Vittorio, his best friend and mentor. 47 attends a confession to admit his sins, but Vittorio understands and believes 47 is decent at heart.\n\nOne day, while 47 is working in a garden, Father Vittorio is kidnapped and a ransom note is left for 47. 47 decides to go back to his old job as an assassin to track down Father Vittorio. He contacts his agency, who thought he was dead, and makes a deal with his handler, Diana Burnwood. He states that he will return to his post as an ICA assassin if the agency can help him locate Father Vittorio. They accept the deal.\n\nDiana informs 47 that Father Vittorio was kidnapped by a Sicilian Mafia boss named Giuseppe Giuliano. The man is holding the priest in a cell under his mansion, dubbed Villa Borghese. 47 infiltrates and kills Giuliano, but fails to find Vittorio. 47 is later told by Diana, that a satellite image shows Father Vittorio being taken away by 'Russian-looking types in uniform'.\n\n47 works with the Agency to repay their attempt to find Vittorio, and eventually saves him. As 47 realizes that he cannot find inner peace, 47 leaves the church and narrates that he can never retire in safety and must return to his life as an assassin.\n\n====''Hitman: Contracts'' (2004)====\n{{main|Hitman: Contracts}}\nThe game begins with a cutscene showing a wounded [[Agent 47]] wandering through a dark hotel corridor and entering his room. He collapses and begins to have flashbacks regarding previous assassinations he committed, beginning with the aftermath of killing [[Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer|Dr. Ort-Meyer]] at the end of the [[Hitman: Codename 47|first Hitman game]]. The missions are primarily focused on replays of previous missions in the original game, except played in reverse. The graphics, maps and artificial intelligence have been customized and improved. In the game, 47 visits several locations, including [[Romania]], [[Kamchatka]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Budapest]], [[Hong Kong]], and finally [[Paris]].\n\n====''Hitman: Blood Money'' (2006)====\n{{main|Hitman: Blood Money}}\nEach mission is framed around the killing of one or more individuals, which the main protagonist, Agent 47 must accomplish. Standing between him and success are armed guards, security checkpoints, possible witnesses and other obstacles. The player guides 47 through the game's levels with the help of a satellite map which can be accessed at any time. The map indicates the layout of each topographical area of the level, the whereabouts of 47 's main targets, and other AI-controlled characters. In order to carry out his mission, 47 may use any method at his disposal to eliminate his targets, regardless of witnesses or violence done to bystanders. Beyond rewarding stealth over bloodshed as is traditional in the series, ''Blood Money'' includes features that directly penalize the player for making too much noise and/or being too violent; either toward their targets, bystanders, or both.\n\n====''Hitman: Absolution'' (2012)====\n{{main|Hitman: Absolution}}\n''Hitman: Absolution'' was announced by [[Square Enix]] and it was released on 20 November 2012 worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"hitman5_news\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124070324/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2013 |title=SCi reveals new Hitman |publisher=Gamespot UK |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman5\">{{cite web |url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |title=Page 17 of SCi Entertainment Group Plc Annual Report 2007 |publisher=SCi Entertainment Group Plc |accessdate=6 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105214640/http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman_mag_scan\">{{cite web |url=http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |title=Magazine scan of Hitman: Absolution reveal |publisher=Xbox World |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 |format=JPG |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717092040/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |archivedate=17 July 2011}}</ref> The fifth installation in the series offers a few different angles from which to observe surroundings.\n\n====''Hitman'' (2016)====\n{{main|Hitman (2016 video game)}}\nA new ''Hitman'' game was originally to be developed by [[Square Enix]] developer Square Enix Montreal, a newly established studio.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lund |first=Karsten |date=25 October 2012 |url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |title=The Future Hitman Game, on a Post-it: Square Enix Montr\u00e9al |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022155821/http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |archivedate=22 October 2013}}</ref> However, due to cutbacks and [[layoff]]s at IO Interactive, a Square Enix representative said that IO Interactive will only focus on the ''Hitman'' franchise in the future.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nath |first=Debabrata |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |title=Hitman studio face lay-offs, nearly half of the staff lose jobs |publisher=[[VG247]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824000242/http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |archivedate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=Danny |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to/ |title=Report: IO Interactive cancels projects, loses half of staff to layoffs |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728110516/http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to |archivedate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |title=IO Interactive cancels everything that isn't Hitman, including Kane & Lynch |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820045305/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |archivedate=20 August 2013}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=This paragraph makes no sense.

After a year, he is shown to be working for the covert International Contract Agency, or ICA, under his handler Diana Burnwood. He is sent on a mission to eliminate four crime bosses across the world, before being hired to kill a fifth target, Doctor Kovacs, at the sanitarium where 47 was imprisoned. As events transpire, 47 finds out that all his targets were part of an advanced cloning experiment, with him as the result; the perfect assassin. Professor Ort-Meyer, himself the scientific head of the experiments, is revealed to be the client who ordered the hits and, to protect himself, sends a squad of docile, highly trained 48 clones against 47. With help from a fellow agent, 47 defeats the clones and kills Ort-Meyer. In the aftermath of this revelation, 47 tries to leave his assassin past behind (in ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]''), seeking peace in a Sicilian monastery, but is forced to become an assassin when his mentor and friend, Father Vittorio, is kidnapped. Getting back in contact with the ICA, he arranges with Diana that he will work for them if they help trace Father Vittorio. Eventually, it is revealed that Father Vittorio's kidnapping was orchestrated by Sergei Zavorotko, the brother of one of the men whose DNA helped create 47, to bring 47 out of retirement and kill everyone who was in on a deal by Zavorotko to purchase a nuclear warhead. 47 successfully infiltrates Father Vittorio's monastery, killing Zavorotko and all his men. Though Father Vittorio begs 47 to lead a good life, the assassin decides to return to the ICA full-time.\n\nA few years later, 47's reputation has spread far and wide with a list of clients requesting his services. After an operation in [[Paris]] [[France]], 47 himself is nearly killed, prompting [[Hitman: Contracts|flashbacks over previous missions]]. In ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', it emerges that the ICA is under attack from a rival agency called the Franchise, who are planting incriminating evidence against 47 through one of their agents, Alexander Leland Cayne. Eventually, the agency is depleted to the point that Diana and 47 are the only ones left. 47 kills one of the two Franchise assassins and is given a final contract by Diana, who has dissolved the ICA, to take down the Franchise. Soon, an old acquaintance of 47, former CIA agent Smith, reveals that the Franchise, planning to assassinate the US president, is merely a puppet organization for Alpha Xerox, a shadowy political organization who wish to monopolize the cloning techniques that gave birth to 47: they wish to kill the President before he can put a halt to their plans. 47 prevents the assassination, but must go into hiding from the Franchise and the police. At his hideout, he is seemingly betrayed and poisoned by Diana, with the Franchise preparing to cremate the assassin so his DNA cannot be used for further cloning experiments. 47's 'death' is later revealed to be a tactic which would bring 47 within killing range of everyone at the funeral, including Franchise agent Cayne. 47, his identity now a secret, goes into hiding and Diana uses the remains of the Franchise to revive the ICA.\n\nYears later, in ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'', Diana seemingly betrays the ICA, exposing it to the public. When the Agency learns of her betrayal, they send operatives to eliminate her. During a mission, Diana is forced to suddenly abandon 47 when she sees that the Agency operatives are coming for her. Due to her sudden disconnection from him, 47 is nearly killed during the mission and decides to cut contact with the ICA. The Agency is eventually able to locate 47 once again. Benjamin Travis, who is Diana's superior within the Agency, contracts him to kill Diana and bring a girl she has in her care, Victoria, to the Agency. 47 infiltrates Diana's base and shoots her, but promises to keep Victoria safe from the ICA. It is revealed that Victoria is a clone, like 47, created in secret by Travis, whom the ICA would train to be an assassin. Diana did what she did to protect the girl from becoming like 47. The assassin soon comes into conflict with Blake Dexter, the head of Dexter Industries and a top figure in the criminal underworld, who wishes to sell Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 finds himself fighting to keep Victoria safe as she is hunted by Dexter's forces and the ICA. 47 eventually kills Dexter and his conspirators along with Travis and his lieutenants, saving Victoria. At the end, it is revealed that 47 spared Diana and it is implied that she and 47 are once more working for the ICA.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', the game's prologue reveals 47's recruitment into the ICA and his first meeting with Diana. While Diana is impressed with 47's skills as a silent assassin, training director Erich Soders believes that 47 is too dangerous as they could find nothing on his background check that gives the ICA any leverage over him. Soders rigs 47's final test so that it would be impossible to complete on his own, although Diana learns of Soders plot and in turn assists 47 in completing the test. Though angered by Diana's actions, Soders reluctantly makes 47 an agent and assigns Diana as his handler. Twenty years later, following the events of the previous game, 47 is sent to Paris to eliminate fashion mogul Viktor Novikov and his partner Dahlia Margolis, who are secretly the ring leaders of the international spy ring IAGO. After completing the contract he is sent to Sapienza, [[Italy]] to eliminate the wealthy bioengineer Silvio Caruso and his Head of Lab Francesca DeSantis who both work for the Ether Bio Corporation and to destroy a genetically engineered virus that targets an individual unique DNA signature. Later, 47 is sent to [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]] to eliminate Claus Strandberg and General Zeydan, who are planning to overthrow the Moroccan government. A contract is then issued on an assumed murderer, Jordan Cross and his family's lawyer Ken Morgan in [[Bangkok]]. Diana then reveals that there's been a \u201cshadow client\u201d the entire time, operating out of [[Colorado]]. 47 proceeds to eliminate the lieutenants of the shadow client and discovers evidence that he has been using 47 to hunt members of Providence, a group of global elites who rule the world in secret. 47 also discovers that Erich Soders is a Providence double agent. Realizing his betrayal, 47 is sent to Hokkaido to eliminate Soders and another Providence operative, Yuki Yamazaki. The final cutscene of season 1 shows a Providence operative discussing a partnership with the ICA to track down the shadow client.\n\nIn ''[[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|Hitman 2]]'', 47 is sent to New Zealand to kill Alma Reynard, one of the Shadow Client's lieutenants, and search her house for information on the Shadow Client. 47 receives information connecting CEO of Kronstadt Industries, Robert Knox, and his daughter, Sierra Knox, to the Shadow Client, and Providence, impressed with their work, authorizes them to eliminate the rest of the Shadow Client's militia, as their attacks on CEOs are causing a global panic. 47 is then sent to Miami to kill the Knoxes, who defected from Providence to the Shadow Client after becoming paranoid about the attacks. After they have been eliminated, the Shadow Client is revealed as Lucas Grey, who attempts to fulfill his own plans along with hacktivist Olivia Hall and insists that they need 47's help to take down Providence. 47 is then sent to Colombia to assassinate drug kingpin Rico Delgado and two other members of the infamous Delgado cartel. After the mission, Diana has flashbacks of her parents being killed in a car bombing. It is revealed that the cartel had been creating fake IDs for the Shadow Client's militia, and 47 is sent to Mumbai to find and eliminate The Maelstrom, the Shadow Client's second lieutenant, as well as two other sea pirates that killed a Providence operative. Grey's location is traced to Romania at the facility where 47 was created. 47 encounters Grey, who reveals himself as Subject 6. As children, he and 47 had attempted to escape Dr. Ort-Meyer's facility, but only Grey succeeded, and 47 had his memory wiped. 47 then remembers that he and 6 made a pact that they would take revenge on whoever made them into assassins, and this prompts a meeting between 47, Grey, Diana, and Hall in Berlin. Grey reveals that Ort-Meyer was a member of Providence which is controlled by \"The Constant\" and three families known as \"The Partners\". Grey's only lead on the Constant is that 47 knows the identity of the Constant. After being injected with the antidote to the memory wiping drug, 47 reveals that the first Constant is an ex-KGB spy named Janus who currently resides in a quiet Vermont suburb. Diana then files a false ICA report claiming Janus is the Shadow Client and that Grey is just a subordinate, giving 47 permission to infiltrate the suburban town and kill Janus and his top bodyguard, Nolan Cassidy, and to search for clues about the Constant's whereabouts. While in Vermont, 47 finds evidence Janus and the Constant were planning to meet at an annual gathering held by a group of the global elite known as \"The Ark Society\" that has ties to Providence. Hall reveals that the gathering is being held on the Isle of Sgail in the North Atlantic, but the Constant, revealed as the man who hired Diana at the end of ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', has implanted himself with a suicide chip that releases lethal poison into his body if he is compromised. 47 is then tasked to eliminate Zoe and Sophia Washington, the chairwomen of The Ark Society who hold the kill-switches for the poison chip, and to assist Grey in extracting the Constant from the island. The game leaves off with the Constant revealing the names of the Partner families and by taunting Diana about what she does not know. In a cutscene, it is revealed that 47 was the one contracted with killing Diana's parents.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSet mainly in a third-person perspective, the core objective in each level of the games is to kill assigned targets (usually multiple and sometimes additional targets as an optional bonus). In most cases, ''Hitman'' allows the player different options to accomplish this task. Players can perform precise assassinations or slaughter indiscriminately in order to achieve the mission goals; however, the games reward a subtle approach by awarding special weapons or cash bonuses if players earn a favourable rank (usually achievable by eliminating only the assigned target, and without raising the alarm doing so). 47 can wear a variety of disguises (such as repairmen, police officers and waiters) to fool enemies and gain access to restricted areas. The focus of ''Hitman'' is not hiding in the shadows from the enemy, but rather blending in amongst them. It is up to the player to initiate violence, since guards do not usually open fire unless provoked.\n\nIn every game, the player character, Agent 47, has limited maneuverability; he cannot jump, scale walls, or mantle up ledges (there are a few pre-scripted places where he can jump from one balcony to another, but these are very rare). This generally limits the player to a single plane of movement, although he is often presented the opportunity to move to higher or lower areas through the use of ladders, stairs, elevators, or hills.\n\nAgent 47 is given the ability to hop over minor obstructions in  ''Codename 47'', and other subsequent installments. In the fourth installment, ''Blood Money'', he is now able to climb certain edifices (such as fencing, vines, loose bricks, crates etc.) and is also given with the option of climbing onto the top of elevators through the hatch, allowing the player to strangle a victim from above.\n\nA major feature in the game is the tension meter or \"Suspicion Meter\", detailing how much attention or suspicion the player is receiving from the public or guards and is dependent on many things. For example, walking around in a guard's uniform with the correct corresponding gun will not gather much notice, whereas running around in a waiter's uniform in a restricted area while carrying a visible weapon instead of an appetizer tray will result in an unwanted confrontation with the guards.\n\nThe second game of the series, ''Silent Assassin'', enforced the concept of kills without firing more than a single shot. As per the number of shots fired and stealth used, ratings were given after every mission. The best of these ratings was Silent Assassin, indicating no more than one shot per target (and a guard) with no alerts raised.\n\nIn most cases, 47 is required to hide any dead bodies, to prevent alarms. As introduced in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 can hide a body in a place such as a garbage dump/rubbish bin. Many targets can be assassinated without firing a single shot; this style of gameplay became more prevalent in ''Blood Money'', where the focus was to make some of 47's hits look like accidents. Accidents can be caused remotely with RU-AP mines acting on some (usually heavy and suspended) object, directly by pushing someone over a railing, and by other, more elaborate methods such as:\n* Replacing a World War I replica gun to be used in the opera ''[[Tosca]]'' with a real World War I era pistol.\n* Crushing a man's neck using weights during his morning workout.\n* Rigging a grill to set a victim on fire.\n\n===Methods of assassination===\nThe ''Hitman'' series permits the player to kill targets (or non-targets) in a variety of ways, using firearms, melee weapons, or conventional objects that 47 picks up (such as shovels, fireplace pokers, pool cues, etc.).  In ''Hitman: Contracts'', melee weapons such as knives can be used to kill in more than one method, including forward stabs, horizontal throat slitting, frontal slashes, repeated stabs under the ribcage, or thrusting the blade into the carotid artery.\n\n47 also has a [[garrote]], or fiber wire. The fiber wire is specially made for strangulation, with reinforced handles. He carries it with him on every mission, even those in which he is stripped of all other weaponry. It is also one of the few weapons which can bypass metal detectors.\n\nTo achieve the ideal 'Silent Assassin' rank, it is required that 47 only kills his assigned targets, and few or no other NPCs. The sedative syringes, or chloroform in ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (which only has a temporary, dose-dependent effect, unlike syringes), exist for this purpose, so that 47 may incapacitate an innocent person to take items or clothing from their body without harming them, so it does not count against the player in the final ranking. In ''Blood Money'', the ability to add sedatives to food and drink was added, to avoid direct confrontation. ''Blood Money'' also introduced the option to hold any NPC hostage using smaller arms and use them as a human shield, and allows the player to knock the hostage unconscious with the gun, saving the player sedatives for food items or any impeding characters that are seated in chairs. In some missions, if a murder can be made to look like accidental death (using the accident system introduced in ''Blood Money''), some kills will not be counted as hits, but as accidents.  Any civilians or armed personnel who witness a kill will count as witnesses, and will harm the player's rank if they remain alive or alert nearby guards. If however, someone (target or civilian) dies because of an accident, it will not matter if there are witnesses. 47 has the option of killing witnesses before they reach a guard, but the unnecessary murder will still count against his rank, unless he kills them with an accident.  Witnesses also include anybody who sees 47 changing disguises or holding a weapon. In the games prior to ''Blood Money'', the only consequence of having witnesses to a crime is that they will seek out police/guards and trigger an alert.\n\nThere are mission-specific options for killing a target in certain levels. Notable examples include locking a target in a sauna to stimulate a heart condition and cause cardiac arrest, poisoning a target's meal (this becomes more widespread in ''Blood Money''), disguising 47 as a doctor and sabotaging a surgical operation, replacing a prop [[Mauser C96]] handgun with a real one at an opera rehearsal, causing an actor to unwittingly kill the target, and causing stage pyrotechnics to explode and set the target on fire.\n\nIn most cases, it is required that 47 also hide the body of killed or unconscious victims, in order to avoid any unwanted alarm or if this is the desired effect 47 can leave the victims body in a wide open space for all to see.\n\n===''Hitman'' insignia===\n\nThe ''Hitman'' insignia, a stylized [[fleur de lis]], appears in ''Hitman: Codename 47'' on the gates of Prof. Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's asylum, throughout his laboratory and is formed by Ort-Meyer's pool of blood when 47 kills him at the end of the game. It also appears in 'Hitman: Contracts' on the floor of the cloning lab, this time as though it is the actual floor design, as well as on Ort-Meyer's belt buckle. In ''Blood Money'', it appears on books throughout the levels as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe symbol is engraved on the handles of his custom [[AMT Hardballer]] pistol; they are referred to as 'Silverballers' in ''Hitman: Contracts'', ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Absolution''. After ''Hitman: Contracts'', the symbol is on the slides as well. It is also found on 47's equipment such as his laptop, briefcase and cell phone. In the film, 47 wears a pair of silver cufflinks with his insignia enameled in red.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Agent 47]]''': A genetically-engineered assassin created from the [[recombinant DNA]] of five of the world's most dangerous criminals. The fact that the DNA came from multiple ethnicities allows 47 to blend in to a certain degree in most places in the world, or at least not look immediately suspicious and out-of-place. His name comes from the last two digits of a bar code on the back of his head \u2013 640509-040147. According to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of ''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'', Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |title=Hitman 2 Interview \u2013 ( Review, Preview, Article, Interview, Q&A ) |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002754/http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies,\" and other similar media.<ref name=\"PC Int.\">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |title=GamesRadar+ |accessdate=15 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919132927/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=145880 |archivedate=19 September 2009}}</ref> According to game director Rasmus H\u00f8jengaard, the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the ''Hitman'' team.<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> H\u00f8jengaard felt the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning \"evolved with the character before the first ''Hitman'' game was done\".<ref name=\"PC Int.\" /> [[David Bateson]] has voiced 47 in every ''Hitman'' game to date.\n* '''Diana Burnwood''': 47's handler at the Agency. Diana briefs 47 on his assignments, oversees his progress, and serves as his guide over the radio. For the vast majority of the series, 47 never sees Diana, recognising her only by voice, however, they do come face-to-face at the conclusion of ''Hitman: Blood Money'' and ''Hitman: Contracts''. Although Diana usually handles 47's affairs from afar, she turns out to be a major character in ''Hitman: Blood Money''; serving as a double agent, faking 47's death, saving the Agency from liquidation, and dodging death herself a few times.<ref>'''Diana:''' You and I are all that's left of the Agency 47, and I doubt I'll last much longer. [[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman: Blood Money'' ([[United States]]) 26 May 2006</ref> In the end, her efforts pay off when the Agency is brought back online.<ref>'''Diana:''' Yes, your Majesty, almost all of our resources are online again. ''Hitman: Blood Money'' ([[United States]]) 26 May 2006</ref>  In ''Hitman:  Absolution'', she is shot by 47 in her home after betraying the agency. Although presumed dead, it is later revealed that 47 had only non-lethally wounded Diana, allowing her to fake her own death. She returns as 47's handler with the ICA in [[Hitman (2016 video game)|the 2016 Hitman]] game. She also presumably continues to care for Victoria, a young girl that she and 47 both rescued from the ICA and other captors. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|2007 Hitman film]], Diana's only form of contact with 47 is through a synthesized voice via laptop. However, she does directly call 47 by phone in order to warn him that the Organization has targeted him. In [[Hitman: Agent 47]], Diana is portrayed by [[Angelababy]]. Diana is voiced by Vivienne McKee from Hitman: Codename 47 until Hitman: Blood Money, Marsha Thomason in Hitman: Absolution and Jane Perry in Hitman\u2122.\n* '''Agent Carlton Smith''': A fairly inept American [[CIA]] agent with ties to the Agency. He has a tendency to be captured and [[torture]]d by the people he has been assigned to spy on. As a result, the Agency has sent 47 to rescue him on a number of occasions. His torture experiences have caused him to take up drinking on the job, making him even more ineffective. Like 47, Agent Smith dons a variety of disguises, but most often he's seen beaten and stripped down to his American Flag [[boxer shorts]]. He seems to regard 47 as a friend, no doubt because 47 has rescued him so many times.  The feeling is not mutual. 47 initially treats his relationship with Agent Smith as detached and professional, but as he is forced to rescue Smith again and again, he increasingly sees Smith as a hindrance. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', 47 puts a gun to Smith's head and threatens to kill him, but in the end didn't as Smith provides him a job which will then lead to the White House assassination. Smith's appearance changes somewhat in ''Hitman: Blood Money'', having lost most of his hair through long term alcoholism and depression. In the [[Hitman (2007 film)|Hitman film]], Smith is instead portrayed as a very competent and dutiful CIA agent. In return for assassinating a high priority CIA target (Udre Belicoff, the brother of 47's original target), Smith helps 47 elude arrest by [[Interpol]].\n* '''Mei-Ling''': A young woman from the Chinese mainland, abducted and recruited into the brothel of Hong Kong crime lord Lee Hong. 47 rescues her in exchange for information about her employer in preparation for assassinating him.<ref>'''Mei Ling:''' You foreigner. Then you understand. Listen, you have to help me, please. They kidnapped me and then they brought me here... [...] First you have to get me out of here and then the combination is yours.

[[Eidos Interactive]] ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' 10 January 2002 (''[[United States|US]]'')</ref> Mei-Ling is apparently the first woman who has ever kissed 47; his reaction is different in the original game from the remake. In the original ''Hitman: Codename 47'', 47 reacts with significant revulsion.  In the remake ''Hitman: Contracts'', his reaction is one of detached bemusement. She was known as Lei Ling in the original game.\n* '''Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer''': 47's creator and the ultimate antagonist of ''Hitman: Codename 47''. A brilliant but unhinged individual ostracized by the scientific community for his radical theories on genetic manipulation, Ort-Meyer ran a sophisticated lab hidden beneath a Romanian asylum. There he labored on DNA splicing in an effort to create a flawless human being. He took a great part in raising and indoctrinating 47 at the asylum, where 47 was kept a prisoner until he matured. Ort-Meyer eventually engineered 47's \"escape\" from the asylum in order to test his performance in the real world. The consummate megalomaniac, Ort-Meyer contracted with the Agency to have 47 kill the other 4 men behind the Hitman Project (47's \"fathers\"), so that Ort-Meyer could enjoy the fruits of his labor by himself. Ort-Meyer then attempted to lure 47 to his death, having perfected \"No. 48\", an improved, mindlessly loyal clone. However, Ort-Meyer underestimated how far 47 had advanced. In the final showdown, 47 slaughtered 48 and the clones, then killed Ort-Meyer himself by snapping his neck.\n\n==Games==\nAs of 2019, seven games had been released, all of them developed by [[IO Interactive]].

(2000)====\n{{main|Hitman: Codename 47}}\nThe first installment in the ''Hitman'' series revolves around a test subject known as 47 escaping the asylum where he had been experimented on all his life and being employed by the Agency. 47 meets his handler, Diana Burnwood, who assigns him to kill four criminal masterminds and then a doctor who is revealed to be the one who treated 47 at the asylum. 47 learns that he is a clone who has been trained since birth to become an assassin. The four criminal masterminds that 47 killed were part of the cloning experiment and their deaths were ordered by Professor Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, the one behind the entire cloning process. Ort-Meyer planned 47's escape, so he could have 47 kill the other four associates and use 47 for his own purposes. 47, with the help of a CIA agent named Carlton Smith, returns to the asylum and plans to kill his creator. Ort-Meyer, having prepared for 47's return, sends his group of clones to kill 47. The clones fail their duties and 47 confronts Ort-Meyer. 47 shoots Ort-Meyer, then snaps his neck, killing him.\n\n====''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'' (2002)====\n{{main|Hitman 2: Silent Assassin}}\nAfter murdering Dr. Ort-Meyer, Agent 47 has faked his death and unofficially resigned from the ICA, leaving behind his life as an assassin, and retreated to a church in Sicily to seek peace. He works as a gardener for Father Vittorio, his best friend and mentor. 47 attends a confession to admit his sins, but Vittorio understands and believes 47 is decent at heart.\n\nOne day, while 47 is working in a garden, Father Vittorio is kidnapped and a ransom note is left for 47. 47 decides to go back to his old job as an assassin to track down Father Vittorio. He contacts his agency, who thought he was dead, and makes a deal with his handler, Diana Burnwood. He states that he will return to his post as an ICA assassin if the agency can help him locate Father Vittorio. They accept the deal.\n\nDiana informs 47 that Father Vittorio was kidnapped by a Sicilian Mafia boss named Giuseppe Giuliano. The man is holding the priest in a cell under his mansion, dubbed Villa Borghese. 47 infiltrates and kills Giuliano, but fails to find Vittorio. 47 is later told by Diana, that a satellite image shows Father Vittorio being taken away by 'Russian-looking types in uniform'.\n\n47 works with the Agency to repay their attempt to find Vittorio, and eventually saves him. As 47 realizes that he cannot find inner peace, 47 leaves the church and narrates that he can never retire in safety and must return to his life as an assassin.\n\n====''Hitman: Contracts'' (2004)====\n{{main|Hitman: Contracts}}\nThe game begins with a cutscene showing a wounded [[Agent 47]] wandering through a dark hotel corridor and entering his room. He collapses and begins to have flashbacks regarding previous assassinations he committed, beginning with the aftermath of killing [[Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer|Dr. Ort-Meyer]] at the end of the [[Hitman: Codename 47|first Hitman game]]. The missions are primarily focused on replays of previous missions in the original game, except played in reverse. The graphics, maps and artificial intelligence have been customized and improved. In the game, 47 visits several locations, including [[Romania]], [[Kamchatka]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Budapest]], [[Hong Kong]], and finally [[Paris]].\n\n====''Hitman: Blood Money'' (2006)====\n{{main|Hitman: Blood Money}}\nEach mission is framed around the killing of one or more individuals, which the main protagonist, Agent 47 must accomplish. Standing between him and success are armed guards, security checkpoints, possible witnesses and other obstacles. The player guides 47 through the game's levels with the help of a satellite map which can be accessed at any time. The map indicates the layout of each topographical area of the level, the whereabouts of 47 's main targets, and other AI-controlled characters. In order to carry out his mission, 47 may use any method at his disposal to eliminate his targets, regardless of witnesses or violence done to bystanders. Beyond rewarding stealth over bloodshed as is traditional in the series, ''Blood Money'' includes features that directly penalize the player for making too much noise and/or being too violent; either toward their targets, bystanders, or both.\n\n====''Hitman: Absolution'' (2012)====\n{{main|Hitman: Absolution}}\n''Hitman: Absolution'' was announced by [[Square Enix]] and it was released on 20 November 2012 worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"hitman5_news\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124070324/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/action/hitman5/news.html?sid=6179961&mode=all |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2013 |title=SCi reveals new Hitman |publisher=Gamespot UK |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman5\">{{cite web |url=http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |title=Page 17 of SCi Entertainment Group Plc Annual Report 2007 |publisher=SCi Entertainment Group Plc |accessdate=6 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105214640/http://miranda.hemscott.com/ir/seg/pdf/AnnualReport07.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"hitman_mag_scan\">{{cite web |url=http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |title=Magazine scan of Hitman: Absolution reveal |publisher=Xbox World |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=16 December 2008 |format=JPG |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717092040/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/9283/secretgames4ol6uy9.jpg |archivedate=17 July 2011}}</ref> The fifth installation in the series offers a few different angles from which to observe surroundings.\n\n====''Hitman'' (2016)====\n{{main|Hitman (2016 video game)}}\nA new ''Hitman'' game was originally to be developed by [[Square Enix]] developer Square Enix Montreal, a newly established studio.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lund |first=Karsten |date=25 October 2012 |url=http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |title=The Future Hitman Game, on a Post-it: Square Enix Montr\u00e9al |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022155821/http://gamasutra.com/blogs/KarstenLund/20121025/179479/The_Future_Hitman_Game_on_a_Postit_Square_Enix_Montral.php |archivedate=22 October 2013}}</ref> However, due to cutbacks and [[layoff]]s at IO Interactive, a Square Enix representative said that IO Interactive will only focus on the ''Hitman'' franchise in the future.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nath |first=Debabrata |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |title=Hitman studio face lay-offs, nearly half of the staff lose jobs |publisher=[[VG247]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824000242/http://www.vg247.com/2013/06/17/hitman-studio-faces-lay-off-nearly-half-of-the-staff-lose-jobs/ |archivedate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Cowan |first=Danny |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to/ |title=Report: IO Interactive cancels projects, loses half of staff to layoffs |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728110516/http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/17/report-io-interactive-cancels-projects-loses-half-of-staff-to |archivedate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |date=17 June 2013 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |title=IO Interactive cancels everything that isn't Hitman, including Kane & Lynch |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=11 August 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820045305/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-17-io-interactive-lays-off-nearly-half-its-staff |archivedate=20 August 2013}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=This paragraph makes no sense.

A sequel to 2013's ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', it is the seventh installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise and stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Paul Walker]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Jordana Brewster]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]]. ''Furious 7'' follows [[Dominic Toretto]] (Diesel), [[Brian O'Conner]] (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the [[United States]] to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in ''Fast & Furious 6'', until Deckard Shaw (Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother Owen Shaw, puts the team in danger once again.\n\nWith the previous three installments set between ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006), ''Furious 7'' is the first installment in the franchise to take place after ''Tokyo Drift''.

Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally.

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

The film also marks the final film appearance of Walker, who died in a [[single-vehicle crash]] on November 30, 2013, with filming only half-completed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fast and Furious star Paul Walker killed in car crash|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/paul-walker-dies-car-crash|work=Guardian|first=Catherine|last=Shoard|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Following Walker's death, filming was delayed for script rewrites and his brothers, Caleb and [[Cody Walker (actor)|Cody]], were used as stand-ins to complete his remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Brothers\">{{cite news|title=Paul Walker's Surprising Replacement in Fast & Furious 7|url=http://time.com/64024/paul-walker-replacement-fast-furious-7/|accessdate=25 May 2015|work=[[Time.com]]|publisher=Nolan Feeney|date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> These script rewrites completed the story arc for Walker's character, which was subsequently retired.\n\nPlans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of ''Fast & Furious 6''. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film in place of [[Justin Lin]], who left the franchise after directing the previous four installments. Casting began in the same month with the returns of Diesel and Walker and an initial release date was set. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in September 2013, resumed in April 2014 and ended in July 2014, with other filming locations including [[Los Angeles]], [[Colorado]], [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n''Furious 7'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 3, 2015, playing in [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], and [[4DX]] internationally. Upon release, the film became a critical and blockbuster success, with praise being aimed at the film's action sequences and its emotional tribute to Walker. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the [[List of highest-grossing openings for films|tenth highest-grossing opening of all time]]. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing [[2015 in film|film of 2015]]<ref>{{cite web|title = 5 Success Lessons Learned From 'Fast and Furious' Franchise|url = http://www.empirehive.com/success-lessons-learned-from-fast-and-furious/|website = EmpireHive|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}</ref> and the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth highest-grossing film of all time]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Fate of the Furious]]'', was released on April 14, 2017.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature-length films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAfter defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and securing amnesty for their past crimes,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]''.}} [[Dominic Toretto|Dominic \"Dom\" Toretto]], [[Brian O'Conner]], and the rest of their team have returned to the United States to live normal lives again. Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a [[letter bomb]] sent from [[Tokyo]], explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is apparently killed by Shaw in Tokyo.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2006 film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' and ''Fast & Furious 6''.}} Dom visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and acquires personal items found at Han's crash site from Han's friend, Sean Boswell.\n\nDuring Han's funeral in [[Los Angeles]], Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by [[List of The Fast and the Furious characters#Mr. Nobody|Mr. Nobody]]. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then [[airdrop]] their cars over the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to [[Abu Dhabi]], where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near [[repeater|telecommunications repeaters]], the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.\n\nWhile Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a [[stealth helicopter]] and an [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle|aerial drone]], Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, though his car crash-lands. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, \"It's about time\".\n\nShaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family. As Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he intends to say goodbye. Dom says, \"It's never goodbye.\" He drives away, but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad. \n\nAs Dom remembers the times that he had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg|175px|right|thumb|''Furious 7'' marked the final film performance of [[Paul Walker]], who died in a car accident on November 30, 2013.

This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6'', which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.<ref name=\"Sequel1\"/> However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Fast & Furious 6 Director Justin Lin|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=104306|work=Comingsoon.net|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Australian director [[James Wan]], predominantly known for [[horror film]]s, was announced as the sequel's director, with [[Neal H.

Their first reaction to a threat is often to flee, although sometimes they stand their ground and defend themselves or their offspring in cases where flight is untenable, such as when a foal would be threatened.<ref name=\"KinseyDenison\">{{cite book |last=Kinsey |first=J.

Humans [[domesticated]] horses thousands of years ago, and they have been used by humans ever since.  Through selective breeding, some breeds of horses have been bred to be quite docile, particularly certain large [[draft horse]]s.  On the other hand, most light horse riding [[List of horse breeds|breeds]] were developed for speed, agility, alertness, and endurance; building on natural qualities that extended from their wild ancestors.\n\nHorses' instincts can be used to human advantage to create a bond between human and horse.  These techniques vary, but are part of the art of [[horse training]].\n\n==The \"fight-or-flight\" response==\nHorses evolved from small mammals whose survival depended on their ability to flee from predators.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCall |first=C.A. |year=2006 |title=Understanding your horses' behaviour|website=Alabama Cooperative Extension System|location= Alabama|accessdate=October 21, 2013|url= http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-1305/index2.tmpl}}</ref> This survival mechanism still exists in the modern domestic horse. Humans have removed many predators from the life of the domestic horse; however, its first instinct when frightened is to escape. If running is not possible, the horse resorts to biting, kicking, striking or rearing to protect itself. Many of the horse's natural behavior patterns, such as herd-formation and [[Social facilitation in animals|social facilitation]] of activities, are directly related to their being a prey species.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greene |first1=B. |last2=Comerford |first2=P.|year= 2009|title= Horse Fight vs Flight instinct|website=extension.org|accessdate=October 23, 2013|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/23342/horse-fight-vs-flight-instinct#.Umeyr_mnpLY}}</ref>\n\nThe [[fight-or-flight]] response involves nervous impulses which result in [[hormone]] secretions into the bloodstream.

In fact, many [[domesticated]] horses will become anxious, flighty, and hard to manage if they are isolated.  Horses kept in near-complete isolation, particularly in a closed [[stable]] where they cannot see other animals, may require a stable companion such as a cat, goat, or even a small pony or donkey, to provide company and reduce stress.\n\nWhen anxiety over separation occurs while a horse is being handled by a human, the horse is described as  \"herd-bound\". However, through proper training, horses learn to be comfortable away from other horses, often because they learn to trust a human handler.\" It is important to note, that horses are able to trust a human handler. Since it is not possible to form interspecies herds, humans are no part of a Horse herd Hierarchy and therefore, a human can never take the place of a \"lead-mare\" or \"lead-stallion\".\n\n===Social organization in the wild===\n[[Feral horse|Feral]] and [[wild horse]] \"herds\" are usually made up of several separate, small \"bands\" which share a territory. Size may range from two to 25 individuals, mostly mares and their offspring, with one to five stallions.<ref name=Movement/>\n\nBands are defined as a [[Harem (zoology)|harem model]]. Each band is led by a dominant [[mare (horse)|mare]] (sometimes called the \"lead mare\" or the \"boss mare\").<ref>{{cite journal |title=Social Structure of Feral Horses in the Llanos of Venezuela |doi= 10.2307/1382634 |volume=78 |issue= 1 |journal= Journal of Mammalogy |pages= 15\u201322|jstor= 1382634 |year= 1997 |last1= Pacheco |first1= M.

As with many animals that live in large groups, establishment of a stable [[Hierarchy|hierarchical system]] or \"pecking order\" is important to reduce aggression and increase group cohesion.  This is often, but not always, a linear system. In non-linear hierarchies horse A may be dominant over horse B, who is dominant over horse C, yet horse C may be dominant over horse A.  Dominance can depend on a variety of factors, including an individual's need for a particular resource at a given time. It can therefore be variable throughout the lifetime of the herd or individual animal.  Some horses may be dominant over all resources and others may be submissive for all resources. It is important to note, that this is not part of natural horse behavior. It is forced by humans forcing horses to live together in limited space with limited resources. So called \"dominant horses\" are often horses with dysfunctional social abilities - caused by human intervention in their early lives (weaning, stable isolation, etc.).\n\nOnce a dominance hierarchy is established, horses more often than not will travel in rank order.<ref name=Movement/>\n\nMost young horses in the wild are allowed to stay with the herd until they reach sexual maturity, usually in their first or second year. Studies of wild herds have shown that the herd stallion will usually drive out both [[Colt (horse)|colt]]s and [[filly|fillies]]; this may be an instinct that prevents [[inbreeding]]. The fillies usually join another band soon afterward, and the colts driven out from several herds usually join together in small \"bachelor\" groups until those who are able to establish dominance over an older stallion in another herd.<ref>{{cite web|website=ADVS 3910|title=Wild Horses Behavior|accessdate=June 22, 2007|url=http://www.advs.usu.edu/academics/pdf/ADVS3910WildHorses.pdf 7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630064947/http://www.advs.usu.edu/academics/pdf/ADVS3910WildHorses.pdf|archive-date=June 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Role of the lead mare===\n\nContrary to popular belief, the herd stallion is not the \"ruler\" of a [[harem]] of females, though he usually engages in herding and protective behavior.

When the herd travels, the stallion is usually at the rear and apparently drives straggling herd members forward, keeping the herd together. Mares and lower-ranked males do not usually engage in this herding behavior.<ref name=Movement/>  During the [[mating season]], stallions tend to act more aggressively to keep the mares within the herd, however, most of the time, the stallion is relaxed and spends much of his time \"guarding\" the herd by [[scent-marking]] manure piles and urination spots to communicate his dominance as herd stallion.<ref>\"The Natural Horse and Unnatural Behaviour.\" Reproduced with permission from ''the Proceedings of the BEVA Specialist Days on Behaviour and Nutrition.''

Traditionally, [[thoroughbred]] stud farms limited stallions to breeding with between 40 and 60 mares a year.  By breeding mares only at the peak of their [[estrous cycle]], a few thoroughbred stallions have mated with over 200 mares per year. With use of [[artificial insemination]], one stallion could potentially sire thousands of offspring annually, though in practice, economic considerations usually limit the number of foals produced.<ref>Bergstein, Stan. [http://www.harnesstracks.com/2002_DRF/DRF_March_12_2002.htm \"We have the technology...\"] originally published in ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'', March 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Domesticated stallion behavior===\n{{Main article|Horse breeding|Stallion (horse)}}\nSome breeders keep horses in semi-natural conditions, with a single stallion amongst a group of mares.  This is referred to as \"pasture breeding.\" Young immature stallions are kept in a separate \"bachelor herd.\"  While this has advantages of less intensive labor for human caretakers, and full-time turnout{{(living in pasture)}} may be psychologically healthy for the horses, pasture breeding presents a risk of injury to valuable breeding stock, both stallions and mares, particularly when unfamiliar animals are added to the herd.  It also raises questions of when or if a mare is bred, and may also raise questions as to parentage of foals.  Therefore, keeping stallions in a natural herd is not common, especially on breeding farms mating multiple stallions to mares from other herds.  Natural herds are more often kept on farms with closed herds, i.e. only one or a few stallions with a stable mare herd and few, if any, mares from other herds.\n\nMature, domesticated stallions are commonly kept by themselves in a [[stable]] or small paddock.  When stallions are stabled in a manner that allows visual and tactile communication, they will often challenge each another and sometimes attempt to fight.  Therefore, stallions are often kept isolated from each other to reduce the risk of injury and disruption to the rest of the stable.   If stallions are provided with access to paddocks, there is often a corridor between the paddocks so the stallions cannot touch each other.  In some cases, stallions are released for exercise at different times of the day to ensure they do not see or hear each another.\n\nTo avoid [[stable vices]] associated with isolation, some stallions are provided with a non-horse companion, such as a [[castrated]] donkey or a goat (the [[Godolphin Arabian]] was particularly fond of a barn [[cat]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}).  While many domesticated stallions become too aggressive to tolerate the close presence of any other male horse without fighting, some tolerate a [[gelding]] as a companion, particularly one that has a very calm temperament.  One example of this was the racehorse [[Seabiscuit]], who lived with a gelding companion named \"Pumpkin\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Seabiscuit: An American Legend|date=2001|isbn=978-0-449-00561-3|author=Hillenbrand, Laura|edition=First Trade Paperback|page=[https://archive.org/details/seabiscuitameric00hill_0/page/100 100]|title-link=Seabiscuit: An American Legend}}</ref> Other stallions may tolerate the close presence of an immature and less dominant stallion.\n\nStallions and mares often compete together at [[horse show]]s and in [[horse racing|horse races]], however, stallions generally must be kept away from close contact with mares, both to avoid unintentional or unplanned matings, and away from other stallions to minimize fighting for dominance.  When horses are lined up for award presentations at shows, handlers keep stallions at least one horse length from any other animal. Stallions can be taught to ignore mares or other stallions that are in close proximity while they are working.\n\nStallions live peacefully in bachelor herds in the wild and in natural management settings.  For example, the stallions in the [[New Forest]] (U.K.) live in bachelor herds on their winter grazing pastures.  When managed as domesticated animals, some farms assert that carefully managed social contact benefits stallions.  Well-tempered stallions intended to be kept together for a long period may be stabled in closer proximity, though this method of stabling is generally used only by experienced stable managers.  An example of this is the stallions of the [[Spanish Riding School]], which travel, train and are stabled in close proximity.  In these settings, more dominant animals are kept apart by stabling a young or less dominant stallion in the stall between them.\n\n===Dominance in domesticated herds===\nBecause [[domestication of the horse]] usually requires stallions to be isolated from other horses, either mares or [[gelding]]s may become dominant in a domestic herd.  Usually dominance in these cases is a matter of age and, to some extent, temperament.  It is common for older animals to be dominant, though old and weak animals may lose their rank in the herd.  There are also studies suggesting that a [[foal]] will \"inherit\" or perhaps [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] dominance behavior from its dam, and at maturity seek to obtain the same rank in a later herd that its mother held when the horse was young.\n\nStudies of [[domesticated]] horses indicate that horses appear to benefit from a strong female presence in the herd. Groupings of all [[gelding]]s, or herds where a gelding is dominant over the rest of the herd; for example if the mares in the herd are quite young or of low status,  may be more anxious as a group and less relaxed than those where a mare is dominant.<ref>Barakat, Christine. \"Is your horse sleep deprived?\"  ''Equus'', February 2007, issue 353, p. 34.</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n[[File:APHA Mare2.jpg|thumb|left|Forward ear position indicating alertness.]]\n[[File:Arabheadshotalpha.jpg|thumb|left|One ear forward and one ear back, usually indicating divided attention or environmental monitoring.]]\n\nHorses communicate in various ways, including [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s such as nickering, squealing or whinnying; touch, through [[Social grooming|mutual grooming]] or nuzzling; smell; and [[body language]]. Horses use a combination of ear position, neck and head height, movement, and foot stomping or tail swishing to communicate.<ref name=Scott>[http://www.equisearch.com/horses%5Fcare/health/behavior/understanding%5Fhorse%5Fbody%5Flanguage%5F022409/  Scott, Laurel. \"Equine Expressions: Understanding Your Horse's Body Language\"]  Equisearch.com.  Accessed July 2, 2010</ref>  Discipline is maintained in a horse herd first through body language and gestures, then, if needed, through physical contact such as biting, kicking, nudging, or other means of forcing a misbehaving herd member to move.  In most cases, the animal that successfully causes another to move is dominant, whether it uses only body language or adds physical reinforcement.\n\nHorses can interpret the body language of other creatures, including humans, whom they view as [[predator]]s.  If socialized to human contact, horses usually respond to humans as a non-threatening predator.  Humans do not always understand this, however, and may behave in a way, particularly if using aggressive discipline, that resembles an attacking predator and triggers the horse's [[fight-or-flight response]].    On the other hand, some humans exhibit fear of a horse, and a horse may interpret this behavior as human submission to the authority of the horse, placing the human in a subordinate role in the horse's mind.  This may lead the horse to behave in a more dominant and aggressive fashion.  Human handlers are more successful if they learn to properly interpret a horse's body language and temper their own responses accordingly.  Some methods of horse training explicitly instruct horse handlers to behave in ways that the horse will interpret as the behavior of a trusted leader in a herd and thus more willingly comply with commands from a human handler.  Other methods encourage [[operant conditioning]] to teach the horse to respond in a desired way to human body language, but also teach handlers to recognize the meaning of horse body language.\n[[File:Curly-horse.jpg|thumb|Relaxed ear position of a bored or resting horse.

Accessed July 2, 2010</ref>\n\nEar position is often one of the most obvious behaviors that humans notice when interpreting horse body language.   In general, a horse will direct the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] of an ear toward the source of input it is also looking at.  Horses have a narrow range of [[binocular vision]], and thus a horse with both ears forward is generally concentrating on something in front of it.  Similarly, when a horse turns both ears forward, the degree of tension in the horse's pinna suggests if the animal is calmly attentive to its surroundings or tensely observing a potential danger.  However, because horses have strong [[monocular vision]], it is possible for a horse to position one ear forward and one ear back, indicative of similar divided visual attention.  This behavior is often observed in horses while working with humans, where they need to simultaneously focus attention on both their handler and their surroundings.  A horse may turn the pinna back when also seeing something coming up behind it.\n\nDue to the nature of a horse's [[equine eye|vision]], head position may indicate where the animal is focusing attention.  To focus on a distant object, a horse will raise its head.  To focus on an object close by, and especially on the ground, the horse will lower its nose and carry its head in a near-vertical position.  Eyes rolled to the point that the white of the eye is visible often indicates fear or anger.\n\nEar position, head height, and body language may change to reflect emotional status as well.  For example, the clearest signal a horse sends is when both ears are flattened tightly back against the head, sometimes with eyes rolled so that the white of the eye shows, often indicative of pain or anger, frequently foreshadowing aggressive behavior that will soon follow.  Sometimes ears laid back, especially when accompanied by a strongly swishing tail or stomping or pawing with the feet are signals used by the horse to express discomfort, irritation, impatience, or anxiety.   However, horses with ears slightly turned back but in a loose position, may be drowsing, bored, fatigued, or simply relaxed.  When a horse raises its head and neck, the animal is alert and often tense.  A lowered head and neck may be a sign of relaxation, but depending on other behaviors may also indicate fatigue or illness.\n\n[[tail (horse)|Tail]] motion may also be a form of communication.  Slight tail swishing is often a tool to dislodge biting insects or other skin irritants.  However, aggressive tail-swishing may indicate either irritation, pain or anger.  The tail tucked tightly against the body may indicate discomfort due to cold or, in some cases, pain.  The horse may demonstrate tension or excitement by raising its tail, but also by flaring its nostrils, snorting, and intently focusing its eyes and ears on the source of concern.\n\nThe horse does not use its mouth to communicate to the degree that it uses its ears and tail, but a few mouth gestures have meaning beyond that of eating, grooming, or biting at an irritation.  Bared teeth, as noted above, are an expression of anger and an imminent attempt to bite.  Horses, particularly [[foal]]s, sometimes indicate appeasement of a more aggressive herd member by extending their necks and clacking their teeth. Horses making a chewing motion with no food in the mouth do so as a soothing mechanism, possibly linked to a release of tension, though some horse trainers view it as an expression of submission.  Horses will sometimes extend their upper lip when scratched in a particularly good spot, and if their mouth touches something at the time, their lip and teeth may move in a mutual grooming gesture.  A very relaxed or sleeping horse may have a loose lower lip and chin that may extend further out than the upper lip.  The curled lip flehmen response, noted above, most often is seen in stallions, but is usually a response to the smell of another horse's urine, and may be exhibited by horses of any sex. Horses also have assorted mouth motions that are a response to a [[bit (horse)|bit]] or the [[riding aids|rider's hands]], some indicating relaxation and acceptance, others indicating tension or resistance.\n\n==Sleep patterns==\n[[Image:Cheval ardennais expo.jpg|thumb|A [[draft horse]] sleeping while standing up]]\nHorses can sleep both standing up and lying down.

In fact, many [[domesticated]] horses will become anxious, flighty, and hard to manage if they are isolated.  Horses kept in near-complete isolation, particularly in a closed [[stable]] where they cannot see other animals, may require a stable companion such as a cat, goat, or even a small pony or donkey, to provide company and reduce stress.\n\nWhen anxiety over separation occurs while a horse is being handled by a human, the horse is described as  \"herd-bound\". However, through proper training, horses learn to be comfortable away from other horses, often because they learn to trust a human handler.\" It is important to note, that horses are able to trust a human handler.

As with many animals that live in large groups, establishment of a stable [[Hierarchy|hierarchical system]] or \"pecking order\" is important to reduce aggression and increase group cohesion.  This is often, but not always, a linear system. In non-linear hierarchies horse A may be dominant over horse B, who is dominant over horse C, yet horse C may be dominant over horse A.  Dominance can depend on a variety of factors, including an individual's need for a particular resource at a given time. It can therefore be variable throughout the lifetime of the herd or individual animal.  Some horses may be dominant over all resources and others may be submissive for all resources. It is important to note, that this is not part of natural horse behavior. It is forced by humans forcing horses to live together in limited space with limited resources. So called \"dominant horses\" are often horses with dysfunctional social abilities - caused by human intervention in their early lives (weaning, stable isolation, etc.).\n\nOnce a dominance hierarchy is established, horses more often than not will travel in rank order.<ref name=Movement/>\n\nMost young horses in the wild are allowed to stay with the herd until they reach sexual maturity, usually in their first or second year. Studies of wild herds have shown that the herd stallion will usually drive out both [[Colt (horse)|colt]]s and [[filly|fillies]]; this may be an instinct that prevents [[inbreeding]]. The fillies usually join another band soon afterward, and the colts driven out from several herds usually join together in small \"bachelor\" groups until those who are able to establish dominance over an older stallion in another herd.<ref>{{cite web|website=ADVS 3910|title=Wild Horses Behavior|accessdate=June 22, 2007|url=http://www.advs.usu.edu/academics/pdf/ADVS3910WildHorses.pdf 7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630064947/http://www.advs.usu.edu/academics/pdf/ADVS3910WildHorses.pdf|archive-date=June 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Role of the lead mare===\n\nContrary to popular belief, the herd stallion is not the \"ruler\" of a [[harem]] of females, though he usually engages in herding and protective behavior.

Mares and lower-ranked males do not usually engage in this herding behavior.<ref name=Movement/>  During the [[mating season]], stallions tend to act more aggressively to keep the mares within the herd, however, most of the time, the stallion is relaxed and spends much of his time \"guarding\" the herd by [[scent-marking]] manure piles and urination spots to communicate his dominance as herd stallion.<ref>\"The Natural Horse and Unnatural Behaviour.\" Reproduced with permission from ''the Proceedings of the BEVA Specialist Days on Behaviour and Nutrition.''

Traditionally, [[thoroughbred]] stud farms limited stallions to breeding with between 40 and 60 mares a year.  By breeding mares only at the peak of their [[estrous cycle]], a few thoroughbred stallions have mated with over 200 mares per year. With use of [[artificial insemination]], one stallion could potentially sire thousands of offspring annually, though in practice, economic considerations usually limit the number of foals produced.<ref>Bergstein, Stan. [http://www.harnesstracks.com/2002_DRF/DRF_March_12_2002.htm \"We have the technology...\"] originally published in ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'', March 12, 2002.</ref>\n\n===Domesticated stallion behavior===\n{{Main article|Horse breeding|Stallion (horse)}}\nSome breeders keep horses in semi-natural conditions, with a single stallion amongst a group of mares.  This is referred to as \"pasture breeding.\" Young immature stallions are kept in a separate \"bachelor herd.\"  While this has advantages of less intensive labor for human caretakers, and full-time turnout{{(living in pasture)}} may be psychologically healthy for the horses, pasture breeding presents a risk of injury to valuable breeding stock, both stallions and mares, particularly when unfamiliar animals are added to the herd.  It also raises questions of when or if a mare is bred, and may also raise questions as to parentage of foals.  Therefore, keeping stallions in a natural herd is not common, especially on breeding farms mating multiple stallions to mares from other herds.  Natural herds are more often kept on farms with closed herds, i.e. only one or a few stallions with a stable mare herd and few, if any, mares from other herds.\n\nMature, domesticated stallions are commonly kept by themselves in a [[stable]] or small paddock.  When stallions are stabled in a manner that allows visual and tactile communication, they will often challenge each another and sometimes attempt to fight.  Therefore, stallions are often kept isolated from each other to reduce the risk of injury and disruption to the rest of the stable.   If stallions are provided with access to paddocks, there is often a corridor between the paddocks so the stallions cannot touch each other.  In some cases, stallions are released for exercise at different times of the day to ensure they do not see or hear each another.\n\nTo avoid [[stable vices]] associated with isolation, some stallions are provided with a non-horse companion, such as a [[castrated]] donkey or a goat (the [[Godolphin Arabian]] was particularly fond of a barn [[cat]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}).  While many domesticated stallions become too aggressive to tolerate the close presence of any other male horse without fighting, some tolerate a [[gelding]] as a companion, particularly one that has a very calm temperament.  One example of this was the racehorse [[Seabiscuit]], who lived with a gelding companion named \"Pumpkin\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Seabiscuit: An American Legend|date=2001|isbn=978-0-449-00561-3|author=Hillenbrand, Laura|edition=First Trade Paperback|page=[https://archive.org/details/seabiscuitameric00hill_0/page/100 100]|title-link=Seabiscuit: An American Legend}}</ref> Other stallions may tolerate the close presence of an immature and less dominant stallion.\n\nStallions and mares often compete together at [[horse show]]s and in [[horse racing|horse races]], however, stallions generally must be kept away from close contact with mares, both to avoid unintentional or unplanned matings, and away from other stallions to minimize fighting for dominance.  When horses are lined up for award presentations at shows, handlers keep stallions at least one horse length from any other animal. Stallions can be taught to ignore mares or other stallions that are in close proximity while they are working.\n\nStallions live peacefully in bachelor herds in the wild and in natural management settings.  For example, the stallions in the [[New Forest]] (U.K.) live in bachelor herds on their winter grazing pastures.  When managed as domesticated animals, some farms assert that carefully managed social contact benefits stallions.  Well-tempered stallions intended to be kept together for a long period may be stabled in closer proximity, though this method of stabling is generally used only by experienced stable managers.  An example of this is the stallions of the [[Spanish Riding School]], which travel, train and are stabled in close proximity.  In these settings, more dominant animals are kept apart by stabling a young or less dominant stallion in the stall between them.\n\n===Dominance in domesticated herds===\nBecause [[domestication of the horse]] usually requires stallions to be isolated from other horses, either mares or [[gelding]]s may become dominant in a domestic herd.  Usually dominance in these cases is a matter of age and, to some extent, temperament.  It is common for older animals to be dominant, though old and weak animals may lose their rank in the herd.  There are also studies suggesting that a [[foal]] will \"inherit\" or perhaps [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] dominance behavior from its dam, and at maturity seek to obtain the same rank in a later herd that its mother held when the horse was young.\n\nStudies of [[domesticated]] horses indicate that horses appear to benefit from a strong female presence in the herd. Groupings of all [[gelding]]s, or herds where a gelding is dominant over the rest of the herd; for example if the mares in the herd are quite young or of low status,  may be more anxious as a group and less relaxed than those where a mare is dominant.<ref>Barakat, Christine. \"Is your horse sleep deprived?\"  ''Equus'', February 2007, issue 353, p. 34.</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n[[File:APHA Mare2.jpg|thumb|left|Forward ear position indicating alertness.]]\n[[File:Arabheadshotalpha.jpg|thumb|left|One ear forward and one ear back, usually indicating divided attention or environmental monitoring.]]\n\nHorses communicate in various ways, including [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s such as nickering, squealing or whinnying; touch, through [[Social grooming|mutual grooming]] or nuzzling; smell; and [[body language]]. Horses use a combination of ear position, neck and head height, movement, and foot stomping or tail swishing to communicate.<ref name=Scott>[http://www.equisearch.com/horses%5Fcare/health/behavior/understanding%5Fhorse%5Fbody%5Flanguage%5F022409/  Scott, Laurel. \"Equine Expressions: Understanding Your Horse's Body Language\"]  Equisearch.com.  Accessed July 2, 2010</ref>  Discipline is maintained in a horse herd first through body language and gestures, then, if needed, through physical contact such as biting, kicking, nudging, or other means of forcing a misbehaving herd member to move.  In most cases, the animal that successfully causes another to move is dominant, whether it uses only body language or adds physical reinforcement.\n\nHorses can interpret the body language of other creatures, including humans, whom they view as [[predator]]s.  If socialized to human contact, horses usually respond to humans as a non-threatening predator.  Humans do not always understand this, however, and may behave in a way, particularly if using aggressive discipline, that resembles an attacking predator and triggers the horse's [[fight-or-flight response]].    On the other hand, some humans exhibit fear of a horse, and a horse may interpret this behavior as human submission to the authority of the horse, placing the human in a subordinate role in the horse's mind.  This may lead the horse to behave in a more dominant and aggressive fashion.  Human handlers are more successful if they learn to properly interpret a horse's body language and temper their own responses accordingly.  Some methods of horse training explicitly instruct horse handlers to behave in ways that the horse will interpret as the behavior of a trusted leader in a herd and thus more willingly comply with commands from a human handler.  Other methods encourage [[operant conditioning]] to teach the horse to respond in a desired way to human body language, but also teach handlers to recognize the meaning of horse body language.\n[[File:Curly-horse.jpg|thumb|Relaxed ear position of a bored or resting horse.

Accessed July 2, 2010</ref>\n\nEar position is often one of the most obvious behaviors that humans notice when interpreting horse body language.   In general, a horse will direct the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] of an ear toward the source of input it is also looking at.  Horses have a narrow range of [[binocular vision]], and thus a horse with both ears forward is generally concentrating on something in front of it.  Similarly, when a horse turns both ears forward, the degree of tension in the horse's pinna suggests if the animal is calmly attentive to its surroundings or tensely observing a potential danger.  However, because horses have strong [[monocular vision]], it is possible for a horse to position one ear forward and one ear back, indicative of similar divided visual attention.  This behavior is often observed in horses while working with humans, where they need to simultaneously focus attention on both their handler and their surroundings.  A horse may turn the pinna back when also seeing something coming up behind it.\n\nDue to the nature of a horse's [[equine eye|vision]], head position may indicate where the animal is focusing attention.  To focus on a distant object, a horse will raise its head.  To focus on an object close by, and especially on the ground, the horse will lower its nose and carry its head in a near-vertical position.  Eyes rolled to the point that the white of the eye is visible often indicates fear or anger.\n\nEar position, head height, and body language may change to reflect emotional status as well.  For example, the clearest signal a horse sends is when both ears are flattened tightly back against the head, sometimes with eyes rolled so that the white of the eye shows, often indicative of pain or anger, frequently foreshadowing aggressive behavior that will soon follow.  Sometimes ears laid back, especially when accompanied by a strongly swishing tail or stomping or pawing with the feet are signals used by the horse to express discomfort, irritation, impatience, or anxiety.   However, horses with ears slightly turned back but in a loose position, may be drowsing, bored, fatigued, or simply relaxed.  When a horse raises its head and neck, the animal is alert and often tense.  A lowered head and neck may be a sign of relaxation, but depending on other behaviors may also indicate fatigue or illness.\n\n[[tail (horse)|Tail]] motion may also be a form of communication.  Slight tail swishing is often a tool to dislodge biting insects or other skin irritants.  However, aggressive tail-swishing may indicate either irritation, pain or anger.  The tail tucked tightly against the body may indicate discomfort due to cold or, in some cases, pain.  The horse may demonstrate tension or excitement by raising its tail, but also by flaring its nostrils, snorting, and intently focusing its eyes and ears on the source of concern.\n\nThe horse does not use its mouth to communicate to the degree that it uses its ears and tail, but a few mouth gestures have meaning beyond that of eating, grooming, or biting at an irritation.  Bared teeth, as noted above, are an expression of anger and an imminent attempt to bite.  Horses, particularly [[foal]]s, sometimes indicate appeasement of a more aggressive herd member by extending their necks and clacking their teeth. Horses making a chewing motion with no food in the mouth do so as a soothing mechanism, possibly linked to a release of tension, though some horse trainers view it as an expression of submission.  Horses will sometimes extend their upper lip when scratched in a particularly good spot, and if their mouth touches something at the time, their lip and teeth may move in a mutual grooming gesture.  A very relaxed or sleeping horse may have a loose lower lip and chin that may extend further out than the upper lip.  The curled lip flehmen response, noted above, most often is seen in stallions, but is usually a response to the smell of another horse's urine, and may be exhibited by horses of any sex. Horses also have assorted mouth motions that are a response to a [[bit (horse)|bit]] or the [[riding aids|rider's hands]], some indicating relaxation and acceptance, others indicating tension or resistance.\n\n==Sleep patterns==\n[[Image:Cheval ardennais expo.jpg|thumb|A [[draft horse]] sleeping while standing up]]\nHorses can sleep both standing up and lying down.

They obtain needed sleep by many short periods of rest. This is to be expected of a [[prey]] animal, that needs to be ready on a moment's notice to flee from [[predator]]s.

After alterations, exit 44 connected to Route 5 for all traffic to get on and off. As a result, exit 43 was shut down and closed in that same time frame. Exit 43 was a northbound exit/southbound entrance on State Route 510/Main Street in East Windsor, which was about {{convert|320|m|ft|order=flip}} away from exit 44.\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]], a seldom-staffed temporary border patrol checkpoint was installed near [[White River Junction, Vermont]], about {{convert|100|mi|km}} from the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.acluvt.org/issues/border_patrol_stops.php |title = Border Patrol Stops |publisher = American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont |author = American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont |date = n.d. |access-date = December 17, 2011 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120213170823/http://www.acluvt.org/issues/border_patrol_stops.php |archive-date = February 13, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Massachusetts Highway Department completed a rebuild of on- and off-ramps in Springfield, to reduce accidents caused by weaving near the tightly spaced exits.<ref name=\"bostonroads\" />\n\n== Future ==\n{{update|section|date=September 2019}}\n\nDuring its construction in the 1960s, I-91 sliced through three Springfield neighborhoods: the [[North End, Springfield, Massachusetts|North End]], [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]], and the [[South End, Springfield, Massachusetts|South End]]. Widely regarded as positive progress at the time, by 2011, Springfield's portion of I-91 was perceived as disrupting the urban fabric of each riverfront neighborhood, while in effect amputating everything east of the highway\u2014the majority of the city\u2014from the [[Connecticut River]], the [[Connecticut River Walk Park]], and the Basketball Hall of Fame. However, I-91 was erected without tunnels, footbridges, and other paths leading to the riverfront, and thus continues to pose logistical problems for people getting to the riverfront, which in turn poses problems for businesses that would like to set up along Springfield's riverfront. The placement of I-91 has left Springfield's riverfront virtually undeveloped aside from the sliver of land surrounding the Basketball Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news |author = The Republican Editorials |url = http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2010/02/editorial_tapping_potential_of.html |title = Editorial: Tapping Potential of Springfield's Riverfront |work = MassLive |date = February 26, 2010 |access-date = December 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the [[Urban Land Institute]] made recommendations for how Springfield might reconnect with its riverfront, suggesting the most cost-effective but also the most development-limiting strategy (constructing pathways beneath I-91).

Preliminary findings indicate that I-91's placement negatively impacts tourism in Springfield's Metro Center\u2014the site of many of Springfield's historic, cultural, and entertainment venues. Springfield's most popular tourist attraction, the riverfront Basketball Hall of Fame, is separated from Metro Center by a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} stone wall, buttressing an elevated portion of the six-lane Interstate 91, and greatly discouraging travel between the two areas. Academic suggestions that involve the demolition of the current highway and moving it to a less obtrusive site in the city have been proposed, including the demolition of the highway and following the original path suggested, Riverdale Road, and, least obtrusive but still requiring a great deal of work, a plan to construct numerous walkways beneath the elevated highway to better integrate the neighborhoods with the waterfront despite the highway's presence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fay |first1=Tony |title=Long term solutions: What could become of I-91 in Springfield? |url=https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/long-term-solutions-what-could-become-of-i-91-in-springfield/1043655415 |website=WWLP.com/news |publisher=WWLP News |access-date=August 15, 2018 |date=January 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:I-91 in Hartford CT.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|I-91 looking north in Downtown Hartford at the I-84 interchange.

The highway's rural character and long distances between exits in Vermont are in stark contrast to its south, where exits are more frequent and the road carries four lanes of traffic in each direction at some points. The major control cities in Vermont are [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], [[White River Junction, Vermont|White River Junction]], [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]], and [[Newport (city), Vermont|Newport]]. When re-entering northbound I-91 at exit 28 in [[Derby, Vermont|Derby]], the control city sign is for Canada. Of these destinations, only Newport is a city, although the other towns are sizable. In general, the road parallels its predecessor, US&nbsp;5.<ref>{{google maps |link = no |url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.730126,-72.5698703/45.0058814,-72.0876317/@45.0062274,-72.0894927,17.96z|title=Interstate 91 in Vermont|access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Tree |first1=Christina |last2=Foulds |first2=Diane E. |title=Explorer's Guide Vermont |date=2009 |publisher=The Countryman Press |isbn=9780881508482 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=MvkoQmVCQlMC&pg=PA238 |access-date=17 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Tree |first1=Christina |last2=Hamm |first2=Christine |last3=Imbrie |first3=Katherine |title=Explorer's Guide New Hampshire |date=2010 |publisher=The Countryman Press |isbn=9780881508413 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QpvEeOtVBXsC&pg=PA194 |access-date=17 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nI-91 enters Vermont in the town of [[Guilford, Vermont|Guilford]].

{"title_page": "Storylines of Coronation Street", "text_new": "{{short description|Storylines of Coronation Street, a British soap opera}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Storylines of ''Coronation Street''}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2014}}\n<!--Coronation Street appears in italics.-->\n'''Storylines of ''Coronation Street''''', the British [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], have spanned more than five decades, from the programme's inception in December 1960, until the present day. ''[[Coronation Street]]'' has covered a number of storylines that created dispute and debate in the [[British media|media]] and caused public outcry from viewers. Popular storylines have also seen an increase in the number of viewers, such [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] being jailed in 1998<ref>Little, Daran. p.241-242.</ref> and the reign of [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] from 2016\u20132018, as well as large media coverage; notably the sacking of [[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]] ([[Len Fairclough]]) in 1983.<ref>Little. (2000) p.153.</ref>  Some storylines are seen as having caused [[controversy]] amongst viewers and in the media due to the sudden sacking of an actor by the programme's producer, or as a result of a topic or theme that openly shocked viewers or was seen as [[taboo]].\n\nAlthough the programme is recognised as a [[drama]] serial, ''Coronation Street'' is known for its light humour and comic characters.\n\n==Controversial sackings==\n===Death of Martha Longhurst (1964)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Coronation Street]] -->\nIn 1964, ''Coronation Street'' appointed new producer, Tim Aspinall.<ref name=\"Little. 2000 p.28\">Little. (2000) p.28.</ref>  Aspinall decided on a new broom policy and 'The Bloody Purge' of 1964 began, with nine actors being sacked in total.<ref name=\"Little. 2000 p.28\"/><ref>Tinker, Jack. p.31.</ref>\n\nThe first cast member to be written out was [[Lynne Carol]], who had played [[Martha Longhurst]] since episode two and the preview of the programme.<ref>Little. (2000) p.6.</ref>  Martha Longhurst was a popular character, and formed part of the trio of 'Ena, Minnie and Martha' who were regularly seen drinking [[milk stout]] in the Snug bar of the [[Rovers Return]] and gossiping about the other residents.  Her sacking was so controversial that fellow actress [[Violet Carson]] ([[Ena Sharples]]) threatened to quit, but she was eventually persuaded not to.<ref name=\"Little. 2000 p.28\"/>  The media reported extensively on the storyline, and when Lynne Carol took a private trip to the [[Daily Mail]] [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] in [[London]], she was mobbed by fans and asked to leave on the grounds of public safety.<ref name=\"Tinker. p.31\">Tinker. p.&nbsp;31.</ref>\n\nOn 13 May 1964, Martha's death was broadcast, and she died of a heart attack in the Snug of the Rovers Return.\n\nMany, including ''Coronation Street'' writer H.V. Kershaw, saw the killing of Martha as a desperate move to boost viewer ratings.<ref name=\"Tinker. p.31\"/>\n\n===Sacking of Jennifer Moss (1974)===\nDuring the 1960s and early-1970s, core cast member [[Jennifer Moss (actress)|Jennifer Moss]] (who had played [[Lucille Hewitt]] since episode four) had struggled with alcohol addiction.<ref name=\"Little. 2000 p.93\">Little. (2000) p.93.</ref>  In 1974, new producer Susi Hush fired Moss rather abruptly. Moss was a fan favourite and many viewers were not happy at the turn of events, with Lucille suddenly disappearing to live in Ireland with no explanation.<ref>Little. (2000) p.96.</ref>\n\nWhile actors in the 1990s might have been helped through such a period by ''Coronation Street'' production company [[Granada Television]], Moss was offered no such support.<ref name=\"Little. 2000 p.93\"/>\n\n===Killing of Ernest Bishop (1978)===\nIn September 1977, the [[News of the World]] quoted actor [[Stephen Hancock]] ([[Ernest Bishop]]) as saying '' 'The Street kills an actor. I'm just doing a job, not acting. The scriptwriters have turned me into Ernie Bishop. I've tried to resist it but it is very hard not to play the part all the time, even at home.' ''<ref>Little. (2000) p.114.</ref>  This was the first sight the public had of a bitter argument between Hancock and Granada Television. Hancock objected to the cast payment system, and threatened to quit the show to safeguard his principles.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.33\">Podmore. p.33.</ref>  The main dispute was between Hancock and the show's producer at the time, [[Bill Podmore]], with Podmore being nicknamed 'The Godfather' by the British media.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.33\"/>\n\nThe basis of Hancock's argument was that different actors were guaranteed different numbers of episode appearances per year, thus some were paid more than others.  Actors from the earliest days of the programme, including [[Pat Phoenix]], [[Doris Speed]] and Peter Adamson, were guaranteed payment for every one of the year's episodes, regardless of whether or not they actually appeared.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.34\">Podmore. p.34.</ref>  Podmore was not willing to change what he called a 'complex and well-established system',<ref name=\"Podmore. p.34\"/> leading Hancock to stand by his principles and resign.\n\nThe problem now shifted, and writers had to write Ernie out but save his wife [[Emily Bishop|Emily]]. The decision was made for Ernest to be killed off in a bungled robbery at [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s factory, where he worked in payroll. Ernest was killed by a single gunshot to the stomach on 11 January 1978.<ref>Little. (2000) p.21.</ref>  It was the first time that violence on such a scale had been shown on ''Coronation Street'' and after the episode was aired, Granada's [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] was jammed by angry viewers. Letters of complaint arrived in their hundreds, and the Lobby Against TV Violence fiercely objected Granada's decision to broadcast the episode.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.33\"/>  Granada stated that the storyline was not about violence, but that it aimed to show the desolation and loss felt by Ernest's widow, Emily.<ref>Podmore. p.36.</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight years later, in 2006 [[Ed Jackson (Coronation Street)|Thomas Edward \"Ed\" Jackson]], known only as Ed, befriended Emily Bishop, having joined her church.

He had been warned by Granada Television for writing unauthorised newspaper articles criticising the show and cast.  ''Coronation Street'' producer [[Bill Podmore]] sacked Adamson when it was revealed he had sold his memoirs ''after'' the previous warning.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.78\">Podmore. p.78.</ref>\n\nThe sacking coincided with allegations of Adamson having [[Indecent assault|indecently assaulted]] two young girls. In April 1983, a Sunday newspaper reported that Adamson had been arrested for indecently assaulting two eight-year-old girls at a swimming pool.<ref>Podmore. p.77.</ref> The police complaint was that Adamson's hands had strayed while giving the girls swimming lessons. Granada Television gave Adamson financial support through his legal problems, with a [[Crown Court]] jury finding him not guilty in July 1983.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.78\"/>\n\nAdamson's dispute over his memoirs and newspaper articles was not known to the public, and the media reported that Adamson had been dismissed because of the shame indecent assault allegations had brought onto Granada and the ''Coronation Street'' brand.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.78\"/>\n\nLen Fairclough was killed off-screen in a motorway crash on 7 December 1983. To demonise the character, it was revealed that he had been returning home from an affair, cheating on his wife [[Rita Sullivan|Rita]] ([[Barbara Knox]]).<ref>Little. p.153.</ref>\n\nAdamson celebrated the character's death by delivering an obituary on [[TV-am]] dressed as an [[undertaker]].<ref>Podmore. p.76.</ref>\n\n===Killing of Brian Tilsley (1988)===\nIn 1988, actor [[Christopher Quinten]], who had played [[Brian Tilsley]] since 27 December 1978,<ref>Little. p.121.</ref> told bosses at Granada that he was going to move to the United States to marry his then-fianc\u00e9e, American [[talk show]] host [[Leeza Gibbons]] and to build an acting career in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>Podmore. p.135.</ref>  In announcing his resignation, Quinten tried to ensure that his role would be left open for him to return in the event that his stint in America failed.\n\nAt the time, his character Brian Tilsley was married to [[Gail Platt|Gail]] ([[Helen Worth]]), and the story conference called to write Brian out struggled to find a justifiable way to write him out while still leaving enough scope for a possible return. The decision was made that Brian should die.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\">Podmore. p.136.</ref>\n\nQuinten was in Los Angeles when the storyline was decided, and upon his return to the United Kingdom, he was shocked at Brian's fate and threatened to fly back to America so that scenes could not be filmed.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\"/>  He was talked round by co-star Helen Worth, who pointed out that he might be blacklisted by [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] if he quit the programme abruptly.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\"/>\n\nBrian Tilsley's death was broadcast on 15 February 1989.  After the breakdown of his marriage to Gail, Brian started spending his evenings going to discos and meeting up with various women. He tried to protect a young lady from a group of thugs outside a nightclub, but was stabbed in the stomach. He died as a result of his injuries.<ref>Little. p.190.</ref>  The stabbing brought massive complaints from viewers, and [[Mary Whitehouse]] delivered an angry sermon about television violence.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\"/>\n\n===Sacking of Bruno Langley (2017)===\nIn October 2017, actor [[Bruno Langley]], who portrayed [[Todd Grimshaw]], was faced with allegations of sexual assault by two women who alleged that he groped them at a nightclub some years previously. Following an internal investigation, ''Coronation Street'' announced that Langley's contract with the show had been terminated, and consequently, Todd Grimshaw would be written out of the programme towards Christmas.\n\nLangley's sacking came at an unfortunate time. The character of Todd was set to become integral to a storyline involving his long-term romantic partner Billy Mayhew ([[Daniel Brocklebank]]) being outed as having a role in the death of former character Susan Barlow sixteen years previously; Susan was the mother of Todd's business partner Adam Barlow ([[Samuel Robertson]]). At the time Langley was sacked, Todd was set to be absent from the show over Christmas, having taken his and Billy's foster daughter Summer Spellman to safety when her bigoted grandmother is contacted by Susan's twin brother [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), after his attempt at scaring Billy goes horribly wrong and the latter plummets into a quarry. Initially, Todd and Summer were both set to return at some point after the New Year, but Langley's sacking threw those storyline plans into uncertainty. Instead, it was announced that the story would be rewritten, with Todd's mother [[Eileen Phelan]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) receiving a phone call from the police stating that Todd has gone on the run after assaulting a police officer.\n\nAt a court hearing in November 2017, Langley admitted to two counts of sexual assault. He was sentenced to a twelve-month community order and forty days of rehabilitation activity. Additionally, Langley was required to observe a curfew, wear an electronic tag, pay compensation to his victims and register as a sex offender. Langley blamed his actions on the stress of portraying a gay character in a soap opera, which caused an uproar among the public.\n\nHowever, many fans of ''Coronation Street'' called for Langley to be rehired by the show, with reasons ranging from his \"genuine remorse\" to the fact that he apologised for his actions. Langley's final appearance in the role aired in the episode dated 22 December 2017. As Langley hadn't filmed any official final scenes before his sacking, Todd's exit story involved a body double driving a car into the street and ordering the aforementioned Summer Spellman to get in, as Todd's mother Eileen looks on.\n\n==Controversial themes==\n===Sheila Birtles' suicide attempt (1963)===\nIn 1963, ''Coronation Street'' announced that the character of [[Sheila Birtles]] (Eileen Mayers) would commit suicide, after her husband [[Neil Crossley (Coronation Street)|Neil Crossley]] ([[Geoffrey Matthews]]) hit her in an angry rage. The public were outraged to hear of Sheila's suicide. Instead, the storyline was re-written so that the viewers only saw Sheila taking the pills and the screen faded into blackness. Actress Eileen Mayers stated that, \"It was disappointing, it was good and it wasn't shown\", referring to Sheila's suicide scenes. However, in 2011, the scenes were shown in the documentary series, ''The Corrie Years'', for the first time. Upon the announcement that the suicide scenes were to be shown 50 years later, a ''Coronation  Street'' insider said in an interview, \"At the time, it deemed controversial. But compared to what goes on in soap operas nowadays, I don't think the scenes will be very shocking\". Sheila's suicide attempt has been compared to that of [[Natasha Blakeman]]'s ([[Rachel Leskovac]]) in 2010 in the soap.\n\n===Valerie Barlow's attack (1968)===\nIn 1968, ''Coronation Street'' scriptwriters developed one of the programme's most dramatic storylines to date.<ref>Little. (1995) p.84.</ref> While Ken Barlow was working on a school play, his wife Valerie was kept hostage after a convicted rapist, Frank Riley, who had escaped from prison, forced his way into the Barlow flat.  The Barlow twins were asleep in their bed, with Valerie insisting that she was alone, only for one of the twins to wake up crying allowing Riley to use them as a threat to Valerie if she did not comply with his wishes. The story was spread across two episodes, the second seeing the police surround the Barlow flat and Riley tell Valerie that he might as well have some fun with her now he had been caught. The storyline saw a turning-point in the Barlow marriage, as Ken refused to believe that Valerie had not been raped.<ref>Little. (1995) p.85.</ref>\n\n===Parentage of Gordon Clegg (1974)===\nIn 1974, [[Irene Sutcliffe]] decided to leave the show, having played cornershop owner [[Maggie Clegg]] since 1 April 1968.<ref>Little. p.51.</ref>  Maggie emigrated to Zaire in 1974 with old flame Ron Cooke.  Susi Hush, the producer at the time, decided to write a storyline in which Gordon Clegg was revealed to be not the son of Maggie but the illegitimate son of her sister, [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]].<ref name=\"Little. p.93\">Little. p.93.</ref>\n\nSutcliffe made it known that she felt very hurt by the storyline, since she believed it tore apart the foundation of the character she had spent six years building.<ref name=\"Little. p.93\"/>  In an attempt to extend an olive branch in an informal apology, Hush invited Sutcliffe to return for Christmas festivities in a couple of episodes at the end of the year, which she accepted.\n\n===Deirdre Langton's attack (1977)===\nIn 1977, the writers of the show wrote a controversial storyline turn for actress Anne Kirkbride and her character, [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]]. In the story, Deirdre walked home from her exercise class and was attacked by a man who tried to [[rape]] her. He molested her, but she managed to run home. Filled with guilt and shame, she would not tell her husband, [[Ray Langton|Ray]], what had happened. Eventually, her thoughts turned to suicide. Deirdre decided to jump off a bridge, but was distracted when a passer-by asked for directions. At that time, she had an epiphany and told Ray what had transpired.\n\n===Ken, Deirdre and Mike (1982)===\nIn late 1982, writer [[Adele Rose]] came up with the idea that Deirdre, quickly bored in new marriage to Ken Barlow, would have an affair with Mike Baldwin. In Rose's line of reasoning, Deirdre would strongly believe that Ken was neglecting her, and that being with Mike would make her feel alive. In the widely viewed episode in which Deirdre confessed all to Ken, she told him that she felt like \"the wallpaper, or a piece of furniture that's been around forever... it's like [they've] been married for twenty years.\" In an unscripted move, Ken, blinded by anger, grabbed Deirdre by the throat and started to strangle her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/21/carla-rape-controversial-coronation-street-storyline|first=Kathy|last=Sweeney|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Coronation Street's most controversial storylines|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>  [[Anne Kirkbride]], who did not know of the sudden change in direction, reacted with more conviction, she admitted later, than had she known of the action beforehand. Eventually, Deirdre began to have doubts about staying with Mike Baldwin. The writers of the series scheduled the episode, in which Deirdre reconciled with Ken, effectively ending her relationship with Mike Baldwin, on the night that popular football teams [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.]] played at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]]. At the end of the episode, which aired on 23 February 1983, Deirdre slammed the door of No. 1 in Mike's face. Dejected and with a shattered hubris, Mike drove away from the Street. As soon as the credits finished rolling, the scoreboard at the stadium read \"Deirdre and Ken United Again!\" and \"Ken 1 Mike 0\" in big letters, to the excitement of cheering fans. The episode was one of the highest-rated in ''Corrie's'' history.\n\n===First transsexual person in a British soap opera (1998)===\nIn 1998, the Street introduced the first [[transsexual]] person in British soap history. Its handling of the story, and [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) ultimately \"marrying\" bookish nerd Roy Cropper, proved immensely popular, and was praised by [[LGBT|transgender groups]], not least in how it highlighted [[transgender]] issues, such as how she remained registered for tax purposes as a man called \"Harold\", leading to ridicule from her boss, Mike Baldwin.\n\n''Coronation Street'' did not feature a gay resident until 2003, unlike ''EastEnders'' which had gay-themed storylines in the 1980s, and ''Emmerdale'' which has a lesbian vet and a number of other gay characters, both male and female. Recently the soap introduced its first lesbian couple, [[Sophie Webster]] and [[Sian Powers]].\n\n===Deirdre Rachid jailed (1998)===\nOn 29 March 1998, Deirdre Rachid was sent to prison after a former lover implicated her in a bank fraud scheme. A campaign led by tabloid newspapers and the occasional graffiti artist, with the slogan of \"''Free the Weatherfield One!''\", petitioned the Home Secretary to become involved on Deirdre's behalf. Even the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Tony Blair]] called for Deirdre to be freed. After three weeks, Deirdre was released from prison and four different newspapers claimed victory for themselves and their readers. However, the producers of the programme had planned the entire time for Deirdre to stay in prison for three weeks.\n\n===Illegal immigration (2007)===\nIn Spring 2007, ''Coronation Street'' began broadcasting one of its most politically sensitive storylines for some time with an illegal immigration storyline. Two [[Poles|Polish]] women were hired at the Underworld factory co-owned by Connor brothers [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) and [[Liam Connor|Liam]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]). The storyline included the police raiding the factory after receiving a tip off from a disgruntled [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]), only to declare all the Polish workers legal. However, it was discovered that another factory worker [[Joanne Jackson (Coronation Street)|Joanne Jackson]] ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]) was an illegal immigrant due to her being a [[Liberia]]n national, who was brought to Britain illegally by a relative when she was eight years old. This came as a shock to all the Underworld staff, but  especially Janice as she never intended to have one of her closest friends deported. Joanne was arrested and placed in a [[deportation]] centre as a result, but was released and was allowed to stay in the UK. She briefly returned to working at Underworld until she received a pay-off from new majority owner [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]); where Carla told her the firm was overstaffed.\n\n===Baby Freddie and the fire (2007)===\nIn May 2007, there was a problem surrounding the storyline which saw the burning of [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] and [[Claire Peacock]]'s house and the subsequent disappearance of baby [[Freddie Peacock|Freddie]].  The production team felt the storyline too closely reflected the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]] in Portugal which was ongoing simultaneously.  As a result of this, the storyline was shortened and rewritten.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Lara |title=Coronation Street axed child abduction plot as it would be too \"insensitive\" after Madeleine McCann disappearance |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-axed-child-abduction-10313898 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tony Gordon's escape from prison and the gun siege in ''Underworld'' (2010)===\nOver the week of 31 May-4 June 2010, it was intended to show an episode of ''Coronation Street'' each night where [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) had escaped from prison and was intending to take revenge on those who he had believed wronged him, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) and (by accident) [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), hostage at gunpoint in ''Underworld''. However, on 2 June 2010 in Cumbria, gunman [[Cumbria shootings|Derrick Bird]] went on a killing spree killing 12 people and injuring many others before turning on himself. As a mark of respect to the victims, the remaining episodes were pulled from the rest of the week and were rescheduled for the following week in double bills with the scheduled episodes of that week. The storyline followed Tony escaping from prison with his accomplice, former cellmate [[Robbie Sloan]] ([[James Fleet]]). Robbie tricks Carla into thinking he is a businessman and going into the factory alone with him. Robbie then held Carla at gunpoint and forced her to evacuate the factory premises. He then left her tied to a chair and gagged with duct tape while he lured Hayley into the factory too. Tony appeared, taking the tape off Carla's mouth allowing her to speak, while announcing his plans to murder them. Tony shoots dead Robbie, and Maria accidentally intrudes on the proceedings. Tony lets Maria go, and Carla pleads with him to let Hayley go, which he does, on the condition that she will die with him. Tony then sets fire to ''Underworld''. The storyline ended with Carla managing to untie herself and escaping but Tony perishing in the blaze.\n\n===Hayley Cropper's suicide (2013\u20132014)===\nIn July 2013, long-standing character [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) was diagnosed with stage-two [[pancreatic cancer]], and was told she must undergo two operations and [[chemotherapy]] to try and eliminate the cancer. In September, when she had her major operation, the consultant revealed that the cancer was incurable and that she was dying, devastating Hayley and her husband, [[Roy Cropper|Roy]] ([[David Neilson]]). During a conversation with Roy, Hayley decided that she wanted to end her life on her terms, meaning that she wanted to commit suicide when her pain became unbearable. Roy could not come to terms with Hayley's decision, and eventually lied to her that he was fine about her killing herself. By January 2014, Hayley was taking extremely strong painkillers and needing to travel in a wheelchair. On 20 January, Hayley said her goodbyes to her friends, and sat on her bed, with Roy by her side. She drank the lethal cocktail, which killed her within a few minutes. Roy and Hayley's friends [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) and [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) rushed up to their flat, where they found Hayley's corpse on the bed, with Roy's arm around her.\n\nThe public started the belief that the storyline was a \"right to die\" storyline <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/17/julie-esmondhalgh-assisted-suicide-coronation-street-hayley-cropper|date= 17 January 2014|accessdate=1 April 2020|title=Coronation Street and the right to die: why Hayley Cropper's story matter|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> but Hesmondhalgh later announced that it was not a \"right to die\" storyline, and merely a pancreatic cancer storyline.  The episode in which Hayley killed herself with Roy by her side attracted 9.7 million viewers, the show's largest figure in almost a year.  The storyline, Hesmondhalgh, and Neilson have won numerous awards.{{Vague|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Bethany Platt's sexual exploitation (2017)===\nIn December 2016, it was announced that [[Bethany Platt]]'s ([[Lucy Fallon]]) crush on her mother [[Sarah Platt|Sarah]]'s ([[Tina O'Brien]]) boyfriend [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) will reach some \"devastating consequences.\". After having a diet pill overdose and being rescued by [[List_of_Coronation_Street_characters_(2016)#Nathan_Curtis|Nathan Curtis]] ([[Christopher_Harper_(actor)|Christopher Harper]]), it was announced a month later that Bethany will be involved in a \"dark\" and \"nail biting sex ring storyline\" as articles say that Nathan will \"pimp her out to older friends.\" This storyline was created to highlight the issue of child [[sexual exploitation]], and was also inspired by the Rochdale sex ring, which occurred in 2012.\n\nBethany befriended Nathan after her rescue, and she began to do hair tutorial videos in his tanning salon. Bethany was charmed by Nathan's flirting, and after being informed by \"friend\" Mel Maguire ([[Sonia Ibrahim]]) that Nathan liked her, Bethany and Nathan began dating. Sarah was less than pleased to find out her daughter was dating a boy twice her age, but kept her true feelings aside in order to not lose her daughter.\n\nViewers expressed their discomfort of the storyline on [[Twitter]], and even the scene involving Bethany sleeping with Nathan was controversial. This caused [[Ofcom]] to view more upcoming scenes of the storyline, and they gave them the all clear.\n\n===Pat Phelan's killing spree (2017\u20132018)===\nIn the episode broadcast on 27 October 2017, the villainous character of [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) controversially caused the deaths of two characters; [[Vinny Ashford]] (Ian Kelsey) and [[Andy Carver]] (Oliver Farnworth) in scenes which were described as \"too dark and violent to air pre-watershed\".\n\nIn December 2016, Phelan blackmailed Andy in retaliation for the latter attacking him with a brick \u2014 as Andy had correctly suspected Phelan of causing the death of his late surrogate father, [[Michael Rodwell]] (Les Dennis). This culminated on the day of Phelan's wedding to [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) in 20 January 2017, when he brutally kidnapped Andy for attempting to expose his involvement in both Michael's death and the \"Calcutta Street\" flats scam development. After exploiting his girlfriend Steph Britton to leave Weatherfield, Phelan kept Andy in a cellar for months until the latter proposed that he find a \"replacement\" for him. At first Phelan refused, but while managing to stop local journalist Daniel Osbourne from investigating the truth about \"Calcutta Street\", he manages to track down his old crooked business partner Vinny Ashford \u2014 whose real name is Harvey McArdle. Upon seeking revenge on Vinny for his betrayal at the climax of their \"Calcutta Street\" scam operation, Phelan agrees to Andy's plan and blackmails Vinny in returning to Weatherfield \u2014 threatening to hurt his mother Flora otherwise. Vinny complies and delivers the money to Phelan, who subsequently kidnaps Vinny and instructs Andy to kill him in order to secure his freedom. After driving the pair to an abandoned mill, Phelan manipulates Andy into executing Vinny with a gun under the guise that ''he'' is responsible for Michael's death \u2014 not Phelan. Following Vinny's death, Phelan took the gun from Andy and turned it on him. Andy's attempts to bargain for his life were futile, as Phelan simply uttered: \"You don't know me at all\", before shooting Andy dead. Phelan supposedly did this because Andy \"wouldn't be able to live with himself\". \n\nIn the same episode, Phelan's daughter [[Nicola Rubinstein]] ([[Nicola Thorp]]) discovered her birth was in fact the result of a serious sexual assault committed by Pat against her late mother Annabel, twenty-eight years earlier. She subsequently disowned Phelan in response to this, as well as learning from the other night that he previously raped his archenemy [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) back in 2014.\n\nThe scenes prompted an almost immediate uproar from some fans, while others praised the show for \"bringing drama back to the Street\".\n\nOn 5 January 2018, Phelan would kill Steph's brother Luke Britton for investigating and unwittingly learning the truth about Andy's death. The broadcast of the episode had garnered 662 complaints to Ofcom and the show received an extraordinary backlash from fans on social media; though most of this was due to the fact that these scenes were broadcast pre-watershed, not because of the quality of the storyline.\n\n===David Platt\u2019s male rape ordeal (2018)===\nIn August 2017, producer Kate Oates announced that she was working on another controversial storyline, two months before [[Bethany Platt]]\u2019s ([[Lucy Fallon]]) child sexual exploitation storyline came to an end. Oates has expressed her fears about how viewers will take the subject of the storyline; \u201cI am still scared but I think that the trepidation that I feel about is useful. It\u2019s one of those storylines that makes you check what you are doing and it will make people talk about it \u2013 we will seek a lot of advice and we have talked about it a lot as a team. So it is a good thing that I feel a bit scared about it as it means that everything we do with it will be done in a very considered way and I hope that will come across.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, it was announced that Bethany\u2019s uncle [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) will become the victim of [[male rape]] by a new local mechanic named Josh, who will also get the street residents ready for a boxing match. The crew of the show will be working closely with male rape charity Survivors Manchester to make sure that the storyline is handled accurately. [[Manchester Evening News]] reported; \u201cThere won\u2019t be any sexually explicit scenes, what has happened to David will be implied by his reaction and behavior when he wakes up the next day and starts to remember some of what happened. With Josh still on the street, David struggles to deal with the shame of what has happened to him. This is a big storyline for Jack and everyone is determined to get it right.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that the role of Josh was offered to actor Ryan Clayton; he made his first onscreen appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 January 2018. Josh arrived at Webster\u2019s Auto Center to apply for a job after the murder of local mechanic [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan). Josh decided to do a charity boxing match in honor of Luke\u2019s memory, and he later met David at the [[Rovers Return Inn]]. David later signed up to be a part of the boxing match, and later bonded with Josh during training sessions, which caused problems between him and his girlfriend [[Shona Ramsey]] ([[Julia Goulding]]).\n===Aidan Connor\u2019s suicide (2018)===\nIn May 2018, [[Aidan Connor]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) commits suicide after secret battling with depression. The song \u201c[[Cosmic Love]]\u201d by British indie-rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] played in Aidan\u2019s final scene on the show. The storyline highlights male suicide in the UK and to \u201cspeak out\u201d more about it and was highly praised throughout the media.\n\n==Major \"whodunnit\" storylines==\n===Who Killed Frank? (2012)===\nAfter he was found not guilty of raping [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), it was announced that [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]]'s ([[Andrew Lancel]]) departure from the soap would be centred across a murder mystery, which was broadcast in March 2012.\n\nPrior to his death, several people in Weatherfield had well-known reasons for wanting Frank dead with the investigation being focused on five main suspects.\n* [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), Frank's ex-fianc\u00e9e and rape victim, forced to sign off her share of the factory to Frank.\n* [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), [[Carla Connor]]'s lover, whose relationship was exposed in Frank's rape trial which resulted in estranged wife [[Leanne Battersby]] throwing him out of their house.\n* [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]), Frank's lover, found out she was being cheated on by Frank's business associate, [[Jenny Sumner]].\n* [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]), [[Sally Webster]]'s ex-husband, vowed to take revenge upon learning of Frank's infidelity.\n* [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), [[Carla Connor]]'s ex-sister-in-law determined to protect Carla from the wrath of Frank's bad deeds.\n\nShortly after officially signing the contract to take full control of Underworld, Frank was battered to death by a whisky bottle. The prime suspect was [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), and she was soon arrested after a DNA test revealed traces of her blood on the bottle.\n\nThe majority of viewers believed that all five suspects were innocent and that there would be an upcoming twist, revealing that [[Anne Foster]] ([[Gwen Taylor]]),  Frank's mother turned out to be the real killer. It was also leaked online that this was the upcoming plot twist. Anne Foster was revealed to have killed Frank after she found out that her son had indeed, raped Carla.\n\n===Who Kills Tina? (2014)===\nIn April 2013, [[Michelle Keegan]], who had played [[Tina McIntyre]] since 2008, decided to leave the soap. The show's bosses managed to persuade her to continue to appear in the show  until May 2014. In January 2014, it was announced that the character of Tina would be murdered.\n\nThe four suspects who could have killed Tina:\n* [[Carla Connor|Carla Barlow]] ([[Alison King]]), whose husband [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] had been having an affair with Tina.\n* [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), who had been threatened by Tina that she was going to tell his wife Carla about their affair.\n* [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), whose illegal dealings in her second-hand shop with her fianc\u00e9, [[Rob Donovan]], which Tina had uncovered.\n* [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]), who, like his fianc\u00e9e, [[Tracy Barlow]], wanted to keep Tina quiet about his illegal dealings and did not want Tina to tell his sister, [[Carla Connor|Carla]], about her affair with her husband, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]], as it could have effects on her unborn child.\n\nAll four endings were filmed but only one was chosen to be shown. All endings of characters pushing Tina off the balcony were posted on the programme's YouTube channel.\n\nIt was later announced that Tina would be pushed from a balcony to her death. Before the episode was aired on 27 May 2014, ''Coronation Street'' bosses confirmed that Tracy would not be Tina's killer, leaving only Peter, Carla and Rob in the frame. By the end of the episode, it was shown that Rob was Tina's murderer, after pushing her from the balcony unintentionally following an argument. In the following episode, it was revealed that Tina survived the fall, but when she threatened to tell the police that Rob deliberately pushed her in an attempt to kill her, Rob picks up a metal pipe and hits her on the head. Tina made her final appearance on 2 June 2014, where she died in hospital. Carla was considered a prime murder suspect, as Tina had been her husband's mistress; while Peter was also a possible suspect because Tina had threatened to reveal their affair to Carla. A few weeks after Tina's death, it was announced that [[Marc Baylis]], who plays Rob, would be leaving the soap. Rob left ''Coronation Street'' on 5 November 2014, after being caught and arrested for Tina's murder.\n\n===Who Attacked Ken? (2017)===\n{{Main|Who Attacked Ken?}}\nIn March 2017, a surprise \"[[whodunnit]]\" storyline took place when the soap's longest-serving character, [[Ken Barlow]], played by [[William Roache]], was pushed down the stairs of his home by an unknown assailant. After upsetting a majority of his family and certain locals, the media narrowed the suspects down to seven possible suspects:\n\n* [[Adam Barlow]], played by [[Sam Robertson]]. Earlier in March, Ken was disgusted with Adam when he realised that he had got involved in selling cocaine, so he shunned Adam and sent him back to [[Canada]]. Adam had always been paranoid that Ken does not see him as his grandson and solely as the son of his arch-enemy [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]), who had a highly publicised affair with Ken's late wife, [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]). When the attack took place, Adam was seen lurking around Weatherfield and got on a bus to leave town after Ken had been pushed.\n* [[Amy Barlow]], played by Elle Mulvaney. Amy was due to perform at a violin concert on the night of the attack, but went missing after she refused to participate. Tracy and her boyfriend, [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan), went looking for Amy, unknown that someone was spying on them. On 19 April 2017, she called DS MacKinnon to inform her of new evidence. A new kitchen worktop was fitted on the night of the attack, believing that Adam was the attacker. Amy had become a suspect in the investigation after calling DS MacKinnon ([[Sandra Huggett]]).\n* [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]], played by [[Chris Gascoyne]]. After seeing Peter arguing with a woman named [[List of Coronation Street characters (2017)#Chloe Tipton|Chloe Tipton]] ([[Jo-Anne Knowles]]) in the ginnel, Ken invited her back to his house, where she lied that she and Peter were having an affair, when really she was infatuated with him. Ken was disgusted by his son and informed his girlfriend [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), who moves out. After nearly turning to alcohol, Peter summarises that Ken is always at the heart of his problems, and tells Ken that he is dead to him before the attack.\n* [[Tracy Barlow]], played by [[Kate Ford]]. Ken's adoptive daughter and the daughter of his late-wife Deirdre, Tracy has always felt that Ken favours the rest of the family over her and her daughter, [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Elle Mulvaney). When Ken is having a discussion with Daniel's girlfriend [[Sinead Tinker]] (Katie McGlynn), Tracy and Amy are furious to hear Ken state that marrying Deirdre is one of his biggest regrets in life. After continuously refusing to help Tracy out financially, Ken apparently confirms Tracy's paranoia by not attending Amy's violin concert. Tracy is seen looking guilty outside the florist when the attack took place.\n* [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]], played by [[Rob Mallard]]. Ken's youngest son who returned to Weatherfield following his stroke in October 2016. Daniel and Ken share a good relationship, however was not impressed by Ken's pushy attitude for him to attend [[Oxford University]]. After his girlfriend Sinead aborts his unborn baby, Daniel realises that Ken manipulated her into doing so, in order for Daniel to go to Oxford and to fulfil one of his wishes. Daniel has an aggressive side, and is very secretive about what really happened to his mother, [[Denise Osbourne|Denise]] ([[Denise Black]]). When Ken is pushed down the stairs, Daniel arrives at the house to find [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) standing over him.\n* [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]], played by Connor McIntyre. Phelan had been doing a conversion job in Ken's kitchen for some weeks prior to Ken being pushed. After informing Ken that he would have to extend the job, Ken snaps with mounting pressure from his family - raging that Phelan is untrustworthy eue to how he sparked the events of their community's most recent ordeal - the Calcutta Street scam development, which left the majority of Ken's closest friends and neighbors defrauded by Phelan and his business partner [[Vinny Ashford]] ([[Ian Kelsey]]) as a result. In the ensuing outcome of the Calcutta Street ordeal, Phelan ended up causing the death of his love rival [[Michael Rodwell]] ([[Les Dennis]]) and later abducted his surrogate son [[Andy Carver]] ([[Oliver Farnworth]]) - thus leaving Ken unaware of Phelan's darker nature despite already figuring out about his responsibility behind the Calcutta Street incident. On the night of Ken's attack, Phelan was caught by Daniel standing over Ken when he was pushed down the stairs.\n* [[Sinead Tinker]], played by Katie McGlynn. Ken was unhappy with his son Daniel's fast relationship with Sinead, and was concerned when he found out that Daniel had turned down a place at Oxford University. After confronting Sinead, she revealed that she was pregnant with Daniel's baby. Ken coldly manipulated Sinead into aborting the baby to help Daniel, while also insulting his late wife Deirdre, overheard by Deirdre's daughter Tracy and granddaughter Amy. When Sinead is forced to tell Daniel the truth, he breaks up with Sinead, so she gets excessively drunk and is seen banging on Ken's door to angrily confront him before Ken is attacked.\n\nThe storyline was not announced until after the episode where Ken was attacked was broadcast. Since then, other possible suspect have emerged, such as Ken's adoptive granddaughter Amy after hearing him insulting her late grandmother Deirdre; Peter's stalker Chloe in an attempt to frame Peter for the attack and the theory that Amy and Adam worked together after Amy was seen making a mysterious phonecall before the attack, and Tracy makes a discovery involving Adam and Ken's will.\n\n[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] released a poll to the ''Coronation Street'' website so fans could share their thoughts of who pushed Ken. Fans and viewers used the pool, with the majority's believing the attacker to be Adam Barlow, with other suspects being; Daniel Osbourne, Pat Phelan, Sinead Tinker, Peter Barlow and Tracy Barlow. The polls changed after Pat Phelan was cleared and found to be innocent, and Amy Barlow became a suspect. The polls currently{{When|date=May 2017}} stand at:\n* Adam Barlow \u2013 36%\n* Amy Barlow \u2013 32%\n* Daniel Osborne \u2013 13%\n* Sinead Tinker \u2013 10%\n* Tracy Barlow \u2013 5%\n* Peter Barlow \u2013 4%\n\nOn 27 March 2017, Ken is found lying lifeless at the bottom of the stairs, with his youngest son, Daniel, walking in to find Phelan standing over him. The ambulance then arrives and Ken is rushed to hospital. The residents initially believe that Ken has suffered another stroke which caused the fall, however, the doctors contact the police after finding a legion on the back of Ken's head; indicating that he was struck with a blunt instrument which led to him falling down the stairs. Daniel, Tracy and Peter are all questioned by the police, with Tracy convincing her boyfriend [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan) to tell them that he was with her all night. Adam is also interviewed, however refuses to cooperate with inquiries and answer any questions. Both Daniel and Tracy informed the police of Ken's fraught relationship with Phelan, who was arrested for the attempted murder. However, [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) had CCTV footage proving that Phelan could not possibly have attacked Ken, which he handed into the police. When Ken regained consciousness, the police inform him that a family member could have potentially attacked him after he is suffering from memory loss, and therefore refuses to see his relatives. Tracy begins to suspect Adam after seeing him discretely talking to Amy, while the police close in on Daniel after he did not report his mother, Denise, missing for six years, believing him to be hiding something. Tracy finds Ken's final will, and finds that she has been completely cut out of it, with only Adam, Daniel and Peter inheriting Ken's assets. Confused, she confronts Adam and threatens to take it to the police, however he states that it gives her a motive to have attacked Ken. Peter's son [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) finds a voicemail on his mobile phone from Peter, sounding very frantic and apologetic, and suspects that it is linked to Ken's attack. However, Peter tells Simon, Toyah and the rest of his family that he was visiting Chloe, and an altercation lead to her face being cut. Peter later visits her to ask her to be his alibi, however Chloe lies to the police that Peter assaulted her and that this occurred on a separate night to when Ken was pushed down the stairs.\n\n==Other major storylines==\n===The train crash (1967)===\nIn 1967, one of Coronation Street's biggest storylines took place, when the viaduct collapsed after a train derailed and fell into the street. Many of the show's popular characters including [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]) and [[Jack Walker (Coronation Street)|Jack Walker]] ([[Arthur Leslie]]) were feared dead but survived. One person died in the ordeal. It was this storyline, and its limits because of filming outdoor scenes in the studio, that prompted the Street's bosses to create an outdoor set. The storyline was repeated in 2010 to celebrate the soap's 50th Anniversary only this time it was a tram rather than a train crashing into the street.\n\n===Death of Valerie Barlow (1971)===\n[[Anne Reid]] joined the cast of ''Coronation Street'' in August 1961 on a temporary basis. She left the soap in November but her character had been popular, especially the storyline centred around her and [[Ken Barlow]]'s ([[William Roache]]) romance. She returned in June 1962 and on 1 August she married Ken. Over the next eight years fans would watch their stories, including two separations, the birth of twins, and Valerie's affair with Ken's best friend. Ken and Valerie were a very early example of a television [[supercouple]]. But late in 1970, Anne Reid asked to be released from her contract. She was engaged to [[[Peter Eckersley (TV producer)|Peter Eckersley]], Granada Television's Head of Drama and one of the soap's producers and was pregnant with their son.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/annes-swinging-sixties-6944169.html|title=Anne's Swinging Sixties|date=14 November 2003|accessdate=1 April 2020|work=[[Evening Standard]]|first=Nick|last=Curtis}}</ref> The show's then-Executive producer, [[H.V. Kershaw]] reluctantly agreed and Valerie was killed off on 27 January 1971 in one of the show's most famous episodes. She died of a massive electric shock whilst plugging in her faulty hairdryer with wet hair and hands. The story had wide media coverage and many angry viewers wrote to Granada. On 3 February 1971 more than 15 million viewers tuned in for Valerie's funeral.\n\n===The Rovers Return fire (1986)===\nThe programme moved to modernise its sets in 1986. Its producers and writers chose to do this by having [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]] set ablaze on-screen, then re-built.\n\n[[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]) was on the upper storey of the pub when the fire broke out. [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) and [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]), coming home from a late-night rock concert, happened to walk past at the time, noticed the fire, and alerted the neighbours. The fire brigade eventually rescued Bet when Kevin could not, and she later recovered from smoke inhalation.\n\n[[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn|Liz Dawn]]) remarked sarcastically that she was \"probably smokin' in bed again,\" when in reality, [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) had attempted to repair a fuse and, in failing to do so, accidentally sparked a fire in the fusebox which spread to the rest of the establishment.\n\nFollowing the fire's devastation, The Brewery decided to knock The Rovers' main bar area, the Select, and the Snug into one larger bar making the interior set match the size of the outdoor set more closely. It has stayed the same layout ever since, but its wallpaper and fittings were updated in 2008.\n\n===The serial killer: Richard Hillman (2002\u201303)===\nIn 2002\u201303, ''Coronation Street'' featured a storyline of the show's would-be villain: [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]) \u2014 who entered as a relative of the late [[Alma Halliwell]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]). Initially the character was seen offering financial advice to residents and buying the house of [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]), in an arrangement where she would have the right to live in it for her lifetime, but on her death, Hillman would inherit the house. He then married [[Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]). Over the months, questions were raised about his trustworthiness, with suggestions of some irregularities in his dealings with people elsewhere. He left his business partner, [[Duggie Ferguson]] ([[John Bowe (actor)|John Bowe]]) to die after falling over a balcony. Hillman then murdered his second wife, [[Patricia Hillman|Patricia]], ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) and buried her under concrete at a housing development he owned. In late 2002, Hillman subtly made his wealthy mother-in-law, [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]), question whether she was experiencing the onset of dementia, through such things as unlocking doors she had locked, hanging out washing that she could not remember hanging out, turning on lights she had switched off and taking a dress in to be dry-cleaned, which she could not remember taking. Finally, he tried to kill her in a [[structure fire|house fire]], made to look like the result of her [[dementia]], with Hillman removing the battery from the smoke alarm. She was saved by her friend, undertaker [[Archie Shuttleworth]] ([[Roy Hudd]]) and taxi driver [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]).\n\nIn 2003, Hillman was in severe financial trouble, and failing in his attempt to get his hands on Audrey's considerable wealth, he planned to murder Emily and thus claim her house. While Emily was babysitting [[Joshua Peacock]] ([[Benjamin Beresford]]), he planned to kill her and frame his stepdaughter, [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise]]'s former boyfriend, Aiden Critchley, who was sleeping rough nearby. Hillman broke into the Peacock's house and struck Emily round the head with a crowbar, but unfortunately [[Maxine Peacock]] ([[Tracy Shaw]]) returned to check on her son, and Hillman brutally attacked her with the crowbar. Maxine died instantly, but Emily survived.\n\nFollowing Maxine's murder, February 2003 saw a number of street residents, along with Audrey, suspect Hillman of Maxine's murder, with Audrey challenging him at Maxine's funeral. Audrey had realised he had made two slip ups with her; knowing there was no battery in a smoke alarm before the fire brigade had checked it, and leaving in the dress to be cleaned on a day when she had independent witnesses to confirm that she had been with them all that day. She managed to convince Archie of Hillman's nefarious schemes (the undertaker had been suspicious of Richard when he was quick to identify a woman's body as that of Patricia, only to be mistaken afterwards). Emily's lodger [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) had also suspected that Richard was less-than honest in his financial dealings with his elderly clients. Meanwhile, [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]), having seen the drunken state of Aidan on the night of the murder, doubted his ability to carry out the crime. However, Audrey, Archie, Norris and Ken were boycotted by other residents, especially Hillman's wife, Gail, who became estranged from her mother, Audrey, after she accused him of lighting the fire in her house. Maxine's family and Emily (who survived with no memory of the attack) all saw Hillman as a perfect husband, neighbour and friend.\n\nHillman himself was racked by guilt at his actions, all the more so when it turned out that someone ''else'' whose house he owned had died the previous week, meaning that his financial problems were already solved ''before'' he tried to murder Emily and murdered Maxine. Hillman's trusting wife, Gail, finally twigged and challenged him, leading to his full and frank admission, in the belief that she would stand by him and not reveal his actions. She however refused to protect him and Hillman disappeared, pursued by the police, who eventually found his second wife's body.  He returned to kidnap his family and try to gas them in the family car, before being discovered, and driving off and crashing the car into a canal, where Hillman died but Gail, Sarah, David and Bethany survived. In the aftermath, Hillman's financial dealings saw his wife and family face the possible loss of their home, as did Emily, while the Duckworths lost their entire life savings.\n\n===Mad Maya (2004)===\nIn 2004, [[Maya Sharma]] ([[Sasha Behar]]) was unceremoniously dumped by her boyfriend, Corner Shop owner [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]). He discovered that his all-time love [[Sunita Alahan|Sunita Parekh]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]) had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]. Maya who had shown glimpses of her true self on a few previous occasions including dog-napping [[Tyrone Dobbs]]' ([[Alan Halsall]]) pet greyhound Monica and dumping it on the Red Rec, stealing an expensive vase on impulse from a designer shop, and driving high speed with Dev into the countryside in her characteristic red MG sports car, refusing to stop until he proposed to her, was hell-bent on revenge. She trashed the apartment he shared with her in Weatherfield Quays causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.\n\nShe disappeared for a few weeks but returned, posing as Sunita entering into illegally arranged marriages to immigrants seeking residency in the UK. She then tipped off the police and had both Sunita and Dev arrested on their wedding day in front of most of the Street's shocked residents with Maya lurking in the background.\n\nMaya then began a campaign of destruction against Dev's business empire. One of his employees working in his Eccles shop called Dev saying it was on fire. It soon became clear his shops were being targeted and Dev knew from that point on that Maya was behind the arson attacks. He soon realised that Sunita herself might be in danger and when he called home his worst fears were realised when Maya answered the phone saying she had Sunita hostage. When Dev returned to the apartment he discovered Maya and Sunita were nowhere to be seen and he drove straight to the remaining shop not yet targeted, the Coronation Street shop in Weatherfield. Maya tied up Sunita in the upstairs flat (No. 15A) and when Dev entered she hit him over the head with a fire extinguisher. She then tied and gagged them both before turning on the gas on the cooker in the flat, before moving downstairs and starting a fire in the shop itself. They were rescued by [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) and [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) as the building sensationally exploded in a large ball of flame which led to the panic stricken Websters evacuating their house next door and all the residents of Coronation Street rushing outside to a scene of utter devastation. With her first attempt to kill her former fianc\u00e9 and his lover thwarted, in desperation she tried to run down the couple in front of virtually all the Street residents but missed and crashed into the viaduct. While attempting a second try her MG was shunted by a refuse truck and forced into a small business on Viaduct Street leading to her being seriously injured.\n\nBoth Dev and Sunita survived the ordeal and Maya was admitted to hospital under police guard.\n\n===The murder of Charlie Stubbs (2007)===\nIn January 2007, [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) was killed by former lover [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]).\nThe storyline had started when Tracy had claimed to neighbours that she was being domestically abused by Charlie, persuading [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) to keep a diary of the \"attacks\" on Tracy, which she'd inflicted herself. The murder itself was ''planned'' when Tracy had found out that Charlie had been having an affair with fellow street resident, [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]). The murder, involved Tracy knocking him out with an ornament, and then carelessly placing a knife, to make it look like self-defence. [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) and [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) at this point, rushed over to the house, to try to find out what was happening. Getting no answer at the door, Peter forces the door down, revealing a \"shocked\" Tracy on the phone to the police. The police arrived later, along with an ambulance, revealing Charlie still alive at this point. Tracy was at this moment disturbed by it, however, she is relieved when Charlie later dies in hospital.\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Tracyincourt.JPG|thumb|150px| Tracy's guilty!]] -->\nAfter the murder, [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) claimed that he had seen the murder, and claimed it was indeed self-defence. It was revealed that he wanted to use Tracy for sex, which he never did do, as the outcome was guilty.\nThe trial was aired from March until April 2007 in which [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had filmed two different endings; the outcomes  were that she was to be found guilty or not guilty. She was found guilty by the jury, even with David's testimony \u2013 and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of fifteen years.\n\n===Liam Connor's murder and Tony Gordon's relationship with Maria (2008)===\nIn October 2008, after discovering [[Liam Connor]]'s ([[Rob James-Collier]]) affair with his then fianc\u00e9e, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) \u2013 Liam's ex-sister-in-law \u2013 [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) ordered his henchman, [[Jimmy Dockerson]] ([[Robert Beck (actor)|Robert Beck]]) to run over Liam at his stag night. Tony held Liam in his arms as he died.\n\nAt Carla and Tony's wedding, a drunken [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) showed Liam's widow, [[Maria Connor|Maria]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) footage of Liam and Carla kissing on her daughter, [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]]'s ([[Helen Flanagan]]), mobile phone. Maria then became convinced that Tony had killed Liam, even trying to run Tony over in her car.\n\nIn 2009, Carla became suspicious of her husband after [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]), who Tony had previously attacked, showed her marks on his neck from where Tony had strangled him. Tony finally confessed to Carla he murdered Liam; Carla made a dramatic exit.\n\nFilled with remorse, Tony visited tearfully visited Liam's grave. Maria saw Tony and he gave her a lift home. The pair began a gradual friendship, with Tony moving in with Maria whilst she was pregnant.\n\nIn June 2009, Tony helped Maria deliver her baby, which she named Liam. When Maria's in-laws visited their grandson, Tony moved out, but the pair realised how much they could not be without each other and gave in to temptation, kissing passionately.\n\nSince then, they had been a happy couple and became engaged on the date of Liam's death. Carla learned of their engagement from Leanne and threatened to expose Tony to the police if he didn't leave Maria. However, when she attacked Tony's henchman Jimmy and thought him to be dead, Tony turned the tables and told Carla to leave if she didn't want to end up in prison.\n\nIn November 2009, Tony suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) found him in the street and saved him. Roy refused to leave Tony's side at the hospital, and they talked all night. Tony then suffered another heart attack, and grabbed Roy, confessing, \"I killed Liam Connor.\" Roy then began stalking Tony, acting as his \"conscious\", insisting he tell Maria everything. Furious, Tony threatened to kill Roy and his wife, [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]). Hayley and Roy then reported Tony to the police.\n\nTony was taken in for questioning, but released due to lack of evidence. Roy, believing Tony was in police custody, went to the canal to do some bat-watching. Tony confessed to Maria he'd been questioned by the police over Liam's murder. Scared, Maria left. When she returned, Tony was gone \u2013 he was at Roy's Rolls, hiding behind the counter with a knife in his hand. Maria arrived at the caf\u00e9 and begged Hayley to tell her what was going on, to which Hayley admitted Tony killed Liam. As Maria sobbed, Tony was shown silently crying, digging the knife into his hand.\n\nOnce it was safe to leave, Tony went to the canal and taunted Roy, implying he had murdered Hayley by revealing the knife when Roy asked what he'd done to his wife. Roy then took Tony by surprise, attacking Tony. Tony then pushed Roy into the canal and watched him sink to the bottom from the bridge above. As Tony was about to leave, guilt sank in and he dived into the canal and rescued Roy. After giving him the kiss of life, Roy coughed up water. Tony asked Roy if he was all right, then left and handed himself in to the police.\n\nMaria found out Tony was at the police station and demanded to see him. She then asked Tony why he did it, then asked if her or baby Liam was planned to be next. Tony insisted he'd never lay a finger on the baby, and said he regretted what he did to Liam but regretted what he'd done to her even more. Maria then told Tony baby Liam was nothing to do with him, and that if there was any justice in the world he'd be hanged. She said she'd stand and watch and cheer, then dance on his grave afterwards. The police officer then told Maria her time with Tony was up. As she left, Tony called to Maria that he loved her. Outside, Maria began to sob. Inside the cell, Tony began crying too.\n\n===The tram crash (2010)===\nIn Summer 2010, to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary, it was reported that the street would be at the centre of a \"major disaster\". It was later announced by producer [[Phil Collinson]] that a tram would crash into the cobbles and the resulting incident will change everyone's lives forever.\n\nThe storyline aired across the entire birthday week, 6\u201310 December, with a special live episode broadcast on 9 December.\n\nThe storyline saw the deaths of [[Ashley Peacock]] ([[Steven Arnold]]), crushed by falling debris in the remains of The Joinery, [[Molly Dobbs]] ([[Vicky Binns]]), who died of internal injuries when waiting to be rescued from the Corner Shop rubble and [[Charlotte Hoyle]] ([[Becky Hindley]]), who was struck on the head by a hammer from [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]) in the minutes leading up to the tram crash and later declared brain dead. The fourth death was an unknown taxi driver, which caused outrage with fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2010/12/15/coronation-streets-four-funerals-and-a-wedding-tag-line-deemed-a-cop-out-612855/|title=Coronation Street\u2019s \u2018four funerals and a wedding\u2019 tag-line deemed a \u2018cop-out|date=15 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe drama is set on the night of [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]'s ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) hen and stag parties ahead of their wedding the next day. On that night, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), who had been having an affair with Leanne, ushered Peter into his office of The Joinery bar, with the intention of revealing all. Molly decided to leave her husband [[Tyrone Dobbs|Tyrone]] ([[Alan Halsall]]), however, when he refused to allow her to leave with baby [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]], was forced to reveal to him that he wasn't the boy's father but didn't name [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) as his actual biological father. As a result, a devastated Tyrone allowed her to leave with him and she headed to the corner shop to say her goodbyes. [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) discovered that her nephew [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max Turner]] had gone missing resulting in her and her husband [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) frantically combed the Street searching for him.\n\nBut just before Nick can tell Peter his shocking secret, a sudden explosion rips through the building as a result of a gas leak, trapping the pair and Ashley Peacock. The resulting force of the explosion also severely damaged the above viaduct, resulting in a nearby tram derailing, despite the best efforts of the tram driver to bring it to a stop beforehand, and crashed into the Alahan's Corner Shop, injuring [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]) along with Molly and baby Jack. After a moment of suspense, one of the carriages tipped down and smashed into ''The Kabin'', with [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) being crushed by a falling shelf case. The crash also set No. 13 Coronation Street, the Peacock's home, on fire, trapping [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]), her two children, [[Freddie Peacock|Freddie]] (Niall Beresford) and [[Joshua Peacock|Joshua]] ([[Benjamin Beresford]]), their friend [[Russ Gray|Russ]] (Finton Flynn), and [[Simon Barlow]] (Alex Bain). A telegraph pole is also struck down in the carnage, knocking out the electricity across the street.\n\nThe initial blast briefly knocks several people out cold and with emergency services delayed due to a motorway traffic accident, the residents began the rescue efforts. [[Lloyd Mullaney]] ([[Craig Charles]]) manages to save Claire, her children and Russ from their burning house before [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) ventures inside to search for Simon. During the furore, [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) is caught in the debris and goes into premature labour. Her husband, John, is warned that if ambulances don't come sooner and if Fiz isn't able to stop the contractions, both she and the baby will die.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, fire crews, police and ambulances finally arrive on the scene and relieve the residents of their work. The first casualties, Sunita and Fiz, are taken to hospital whilst Molly's baby Jack is pulled out from the rubble of the corner shop and Jason is able to get Simon out the Peacocks' house. Meanwhile, Becky and Steve frantically continue to search for Max but soon find themselves in trouble when Max's mother [[Kylie Platt|Kylie]] ([[Paula Lane]]) unexpectedly turns up. Rita remained trapped in the remains of ''The Kabin'' and was undiscovered as everyone thought she had gone out for the evening with a friend, not realising that her friend had cancelled resulting in Rita deciding to stay in for the night.\n\nInside the remains of The Joinery, Nick and Ashley continue to struggle in getting a seriously wounded Peter to safety. Rescue workers are able to locate them in time and quickly pull Peter out and into a waiting ambulance. Weakened by the fumes and dust, Ashley tells Nick to get out immediately, sacrificing his life for him. Nick reluctantly does so, just as the roof of the building caves in and collapses on top of Ashley, resulting in his death.\n\nThe drama continued throughout a special live episode, broadcast on 9 December, the soap's date of birth 50 years ago. The 60-minute instalment saw Fiz give birth to a baby girl 3 months premature; John attempting to hide the body of Charlotte, whom he had supposedly killed in the second 6 December episode only to be caught by the police, but got away as he had already discarded the evidence however he was horrified to discover she was still alive; Claire attempting to cope with the devastating news of Ashley's death; [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) opening up over his refusal to help out as it reminded him about the trauma he suffered when on his army tour of duty in Afghanistan; Kylie admitting to Steve and Becky that she had removed Max and, after already spending the \u00a320,000 they had given her so they could keep him, demanding another payment of \u00a35,000 from them if they wanted him returned; Molly telling [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) the truth about baby Jack's father before succumbing to her injuries and Peter marrying Leanne before suffering a [[cardiac arrest]] as the episode ended.\n\nAs the tragic situation continued to unfold, Peter was rushed into emergency surgery which was successful but still remained critically ill. Peter then married Leanne while in critical condition, with Carla watching on, in the fear that he wouldn't recover to wed her properly. John made an attempt to switch off Charlotte's life support machinery and nearly got caught by her parents and John passed himself off as [[Colin Fishwick]] ([[David Crellin]]), who died during a heated argument with John and Charlotte back in July. John later got his wish when doctors declared Charlotte as brain dead.\n\nLeft stunned by the claims of Kevin cheating on her, Sally was left devastated when she forced Kevin to admit all. Upon learning that Kevin had planned to leave her before discovering she had cancer the previous Christmas she told him their marriage was over. Meanwhile, Tyrone pledged to Kevin that he would continue to care for baby Jack despite not being his true father, but swore revenge on the man who Molly had an affair with and got her pregnant not realising it was Kevin himself. Meanwhile, after having been trapped inside ''The Kabin'' for several hours with no notice, Rita was finally found and taken to hospital. The night's activity ended with most of the residents sleeping inside The Rovers Return as the police had cordoned off their houses.\n\nITV released the entire week of episodes on DVD release on 21 February 2011.<ref>http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/18438376/Coronation-Street-Tram-Crash/Product.html</ref>\n\n===Fire at Victoria Court (2015)===\nIn April 2015, it was announced that a huge fire would break out at the Victoria Court flats, after an unnamed person, living nearby to the ''Coronation Street'' set, dialled 999 after discovering a fire on the premises. The storyline was played out in May 2015, as the soap temporarily moved to a 9pm post-watershed slot to accommodate the live semi-finals of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', which has been the case each year for one week since 2010.\n\nAfter being thwarted by [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) in her sly attempts to take control of The Rovers Return in May, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) swears to take revenge on everyone that have ruined her plans. She first confesses to [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]), at her son [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) and [[Michelle Connor]]'s ([[Kym Marsh]]) wedding reception, that she had been having an affair with [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), as part of her plot the purchase the pub. She then heads into Carla's flat at Victoria Court, and briefly considers murdering her whilst she slept on the sofa, before instead lighting a candle and leaving it next to a lampshade.\n\nCarla's flat is soon engulfed in flames, but she is quickly rescued by [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]). Carla then reveals that Tracy's daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Elle Mulvaney) is still inside and both Leanne and her boyfriend [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]) go back inside to find her. As concerned onlookers soon arrived to help out, Leanne and Amy are helped to safety, with Leanne agreeing to marry Kal, having proposed to her shortly before the fire. Suddenly, a gas cylinder ignites on the balcony and the flat erupts in a huge fireball. Kal is pronounced dead at the scene, after he was still trapped on the balcony at the time of the explosion.\n\nWhilst the fire erupted, [[Jenny Bradley]] ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) made an attempt to snatch [[Kevin Webster]]'s ([[Michael Le Vell]]) son [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]], only to be thwarted by an unsuspecting [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]). As she made her way to her way to the scene of the fire to tell her girlfriend [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]), the pair had recently agreed to rent a flat to live in together, a second explosion erupted at the nearby builders' yard, caused by a stray flame that ignited a batch of flammable chemicals. Maddie took the full force of the blast, being knocked unconscious and left severely injured. She never regained consciousness and later died in hospital from head injuries sustained by the blast.\n\nCarla started drinking and gambling heavily after the fire, feeling that she was responsible. She goes to a quarry to drown her sorrows, taking Tracy with her, and, when Carla was about to commit suicide, Tracy confessed. Carla exposes Tracy as the culprit in the Rovers and gets her arrested. Tracy is released without charge due to lack of evidence. Underworld, which suffered heavily because of Carla's gambling, had to be bailed out by [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley]]).\n\n===Callum terrorises the Platts (2015)===\nDrug dealer [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward), the biological father of [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max Turner]] (Harry McDermott), harasses the Platt family for custody of Max for several months. He particularly antagonises [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), due to his remarks about Max's mother and David's wife, [[Kylie Platt|Kylie]] ([[Paula Lane]]). Callum begins a relationship with [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]), to the Platts' dismay. Callum manipulates Sarah's teenage daughter [[Bethany Platt]] ([[Lucy Fallon]]) to buy drugs for him whilst he films her. Sarah splits up with Callum in August 2015 after Max finds a gun in his bedroom in Callum's flat. Callum shows Sarah the footage of Bethany buying the drugs. Sarah warns Bethany to stay away from Callum.\n\nCallum wins custody of Max later that month, and Sarah confides in [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) that he is harassing her and Bethany. Jason enters the Rovers and warns Callum to stay away from Sarah and Bethany, throwing his drink onto his lap. At the same time, Sarah has Callum arrested for the gun. However, Max mistakenly tells the police that the gun was a toy and Callum is released. Callum promises Sarah that he will destroy the Platt family and Jason promises to get rid of him. After David refuses to let Callum see Max, Callum pins David up against a wall, Jason then stops him and throws him onto the street threatening him to stay away from the Platts or he will be dealt with. A furious Callum enlists two thugs to severely beat Jason up, which is witnessed by Max. Jason is discovered by Sarah and rushed to hospital, where his parents [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard) are told he might lose the use of his legs and speech. Max tells David and Kylie what he saw, and when Jason regains consciousness he reinforces Max's story. Max is interviewed by the police, but Callum drugs Sarah, threatening Bethany with the help of [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) to give him a false alibi or he will kill Sarah. The police believe Bethany and the Platts are furious when Bethany announces she lied to the police for Callum. Tony promises revenge and drags Callum into the ginnel and beats him up severely, but he is stopped by [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]).\n\nCallum kidnaps Max the following month and shouts at him when he demands to go home. Callum is under pressure to pay off a drugs supplier and forces the Platts to pay him \u00a320,000. They immediately refuse and Callum leaves but promises to return for the money. Jason goes to Callum's flat where he punches him. Callum then returns to the Platts and asks them if they sent Jason and Tony to his flat, however they deny having anything to do with it. Callum then states that he will ruin their lives until he is paid. Kylie slaps Callum in the caf\u00e9 and he gets his thugs to terrorise [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in her salon. Callum then trashes the Platt household and, when he returns, he faces Kylie who tries to call the police on Callum, but he stops her. He then intimidates her for the money but Gail throws Callum out of the house. He pushes Max in front of [[Nick Tilsley]]'s ([[Ben Price]]) van after Max hurts Callum by saying that David is his father and that he hates him. Max injures his leg in the accident. Soon after, Bethany confesses that she was forced to give a false alibi for Callum to the police after he threatened her by drugging Sarah and saying that he would kill her. The Platts tell Bethany to tell the police the truth about Callum and soon after in the bistro Callum shows up and asks about Max. Kylie then annoys Callum and he gets violent just as the police walk in and arrest him for assaulting Jason and perverting the course of justice. He is released on bail and tells David and Kylie that he'll leave them alone if he gets his money. David goes looking for money but can't make enough for Callum's demands in time. He then goes after Callum with his mind set on ending the war between the Platts and Callum. Sarah goes into the Rovers and finds Kylie. She tells her David has gone to find Callum which leaves Sarah panicking. As Kylie goes to the toilet, Sarah uses her phone and texts Callum saying she has the money and to meet her at the house. Sarah records Callum in the Platt house talking about his evil deeds. Callum finds her phone recording and after asking where David and Kylie and if they have the money, Sarah says they can't get that kind of money and Callum starts to torture her. When Sarah tries to escape the house, Callum pins her down on the floor and begins to rape her, only to be stopped when Kylie bludgeons him with a wrench, instantly killing Callum. They dump his corpse in a manhole in Gail's annex, which gets covered by cement. Sarah is left traumatised.\n\nAfter her ordeal, Sarah gives birth to Callum's child, [[Harry Platt (Coronation Street)|Harry Platt]], and is constantly concerned about his safety. She becomes mentally unstable, slowly developing [[postpartum psychosis]], and begins to believe Callum is still alive. She is then admitted to a psychiatric ward when her illness worsens.\n\nIn May 2016, after a series of events at Nick and [[Carla Connor]]'s ([[Alison King]]) wedding lead to [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) and [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) crashing into Gail's annexe. Callum's decomposed body is discovered and the Platts are all interviewed by the police. Sarah cannot control her emotions. She tells Jason's brother [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) that she is responsible for Callum's death, and, Todd believing that Sarah was confessing to killing him, protecting Sarah and Jason, tells the police that Tony, who has died off-screen, killed Callum. Evil builder [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) blackmails Jason in order to keep the murder wrench hidden. Jason then caves in and asks Phelan to retrieve the tool bag with wrench in it and he hands it in to the police who then believe Tony was the murderer after his and Callum's DNA is found on it. The Platts are then told of this and begin to think that the memory of Callum will no longer bother them again but Kylie thinks otherwise and convinces David to move to Barbados.\n\n===Tracy blackmails Carla (2016)===\nIn December 2015, [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) whilst in prison begins sending [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley]]) visiting orders, and reveals that Johnny could potentially be [[Carla Connor]]'s ([[Alison King]]) biological father. He does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. This reveals that he is Carla's biological father, and he decides to break the news to her. Carla is furious and slaps Johnny, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell children [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate]] ([[Faye Brookes]]). Carla heads for a casino where she bumps into [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), [[Tracy Barlow]]'s ([[Kate Ford]]) ex-husband, who had just broken up with her for planning to elope with Rob, and after gambling with him, Carla has sex with him. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell fianc\u00e9e [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]). Carla tells Aidan and Kate about Johnny being her dad and they disown him. They and Carla eventually reconcile with him.\n\nIn January 2016, Carla tries to stop Robert from buying into the bistro and they have an argument, with Tracy listening and discovering what happened. Two thugs rob the empty bistro and attack Carla, and when she chases them for her handbag she gets dragged down the street in their car and falls out, landing her in a critical condition. Tracy confronts Carla and blackmails her to move to Devon in turn for not telling Nick about her and Robert. Robert buys the bistro from Nick with Carla's money. Tracy continues to blackmail her.\n\nOn Carla's wedding day, Tracy is threatened by Johnny that she will not ruin her day. She does, first by sending the wedding flowers to the wrong place. Johnny, fearing that Tracy will ruin everything, locks her in a storeroom in Underworld. Carla, feeling guilty, tells Nick about Robert. He forgives her and they continue the wedding. Tracy breaks free and tells Nick about the blackmail, leading Nick to split up with her and to punch Robert, who splits up with Tracy, and [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Rodwell]] ([[Helen Worth]]) slapping Carla.\n\n=== Kylie Platt's death (2016) ===\nIn February 2016, when it was announced that [[Paula Lane]], who played [[Kylie Platt]] since 2010, had quit the soap after five years, ''Coronation Street'' producers also announced that they were working on a \"top secret storyline\" for Kylie's exit. Many fans and viewers thought that Kylie was going to be imprisoned for [[Callum Logan]]'s (Sean Ward) murder, but on 1 July 2016, it was finally revealed that Kylie will be killed off. Lane and [[Jack P. Shepherd]], who has played Kylie's husband [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] since 2000, said that they actually cried after reading the scripts and during Kylie's death scene.\n\nProducers kept details about Kylie's death quiet until the episode aired on 15 July 2016; she was stabbed in the chest by Callum's friend, [[Clayton Hibbs]] (Callum Harrison), during a fight with him in an attempt to protect her friend, [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell). She died in David's arms in the middle of the street just after an ambulance arrived.\n\nKylie's death received a mixed response from viewers and critics alike, many expressed disappointment, calling it an anticlimax, and others criticized her death scene for being too violent.<ref name=\"KylieDeathCriticism\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/tv/coronation-street/571659/coronation-street-did-you-notice-these-6-things-about-kylie-platts-death|title=Did you notice these 6 thiings about Kylie Platt's death?|first=Charlotte|last=Tutton|date=15 July 2016|work=[[OK! Magazine]]}}</ref> The scenes were further criticised for the many discrepancies, including slow ambulance response times, the close proximity of the medical centre, the failure of any characters to administer first-aid, and more.<ref name=\"KylieDeathCriticism\"/> However, Lane and Shepherd's acting was praised, along with the emotional nature of the scenes.\n\n===Car crash and explosion (2016)===\nIn July 2016, it was reported that an explosion would rip through the street later in the year. In August 2016, ''Coronation Street'' actress [[Samia Ghadie]], who plays [[Maria Connor]] in the soap said that another \"well\u2013loved\" character would be killed off in the explosion months after [[Kylie Platt]]'s ([[Paula Lane]]) heartbreaking death and that she had already had a read through of the scripts. The street explosion took place on 21 October 2016 after a week of events after a car crash caused by [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) happened as he was trying to get revenge on Kylie's killer. [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) was trapped under the car but managed to get out before it exploded however his mother [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) was set on fire and badly injured.\n\n==Smaller storylines==\n*On 11 September 1961, [[Ida Barlow]] ([[Noel Dyson]]) was struck by a bus and killed.\n*In 1961, [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Patricia Phoenix]]) received a poison pen letter during her affair with a married man.\n*In 1967, [[Elsie Tanner]] wed former GI [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] (his surname was almost changed at the last minute; no one would have changed Elsie's, since she was such a popular character) in the Street's first lavish wedding shoot. Steve was played by Canadian actor [[Paul Maxwell]].\n*In 1969, in time to usher in colour television transmissions, the show planned an outing to the Lake District, so that viewers could see the autumn foliage in all its glory. However, there was no colour film available for the episode, leading to the videotaped studio footage being in colour and the filmed exterior footage being in black and white.  So the first full colour episode aired was to be after the core cast members had been involved in a car accident on the way back from the Lake, and were all in hospital.\n*In 1975, a warehouse fire killed [[Edna Gee]] (Mavis Rogerson).\n*In 1980, [[Renee Bradshaw|Renee Roberts]] ([[Madge Hindle]]) was killed off after public opinion polls showed the character (as well as her marriage to [[Alf Roberts]], played by actor [[Bryan Mosley]]) to be very unpopular.

The storyline won high praise, including from [[Yvette Cooper]], the government health minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/662122.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Street drama wins praise|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref>\n*2001 featured the rape of [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), [[Les Battersby]]'s ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]) teenage stepdaughter, by Phil Simmonds ([[Jack Deam]]).\n*In 2001, [[Alma Halliwell|Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]), the ex-wife of Mike Baldwin, died from cervical cancer.\n*In 2001, Sarah Platt, daughter of fell foul of Gary Adams ([[Samuel Kane]]), an internet stalker whom she met through a chatroom.

Her grief-stricken but practical mother [[Angela Harris (Coronation Street)|Angela Harris]] ([[Kathryn Hunt]]) decided it was best if they denied all knowledge of the murder. When the police arrested Angela on suspicion of the murder of her husband, she believed Katy wouldn't survive in jail so she took the blame, plead guilty in court, and was sentenced to prison. Katy, who is diabetic, felt overwhelmed with the guilt of her parents' fate and committed suicide by drinking a bag of sugar mixed with cola and not taking her insulin. Although her suicide note exonerated Angela of the murder, she was still sentenced to prison for four years for [[perjury]].

''[[Coronation Street]]'' has covered a number of storylines that created dispute and debate in the [[British media|media]] and caused public outcry from viewers. Popular storylines have also seen an increase in the number of viewers, such [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Rachid]] being jailed in 1998<ref>Little, Daran. p.241-242.</ref> and the reign of [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] from 2016\u20132018, as well as large media coverage; notably the sacking of [[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]] ([[Len Fairclough]]) in 1983.<ref>Little. (2000) p.153.</ref>  Some storylines are seen as having caused [[controversy]] amongst viewers and in the media due to the sudden sacking of an actor by the programme's producer, or as a result of a topic or theme that openly shocked viewers or was seen as [[taboo]].\n\nAlthough the programme is recognised as a [[drama]] serial, ''Coronation Street'' is known for its light humour and comic characters.\n\n==Controversial sackings==\n===Death of Martha Longhurst (1964)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Coronation Street]] -->\nIn 1964, ''Coronation Street'' appointed new producer, Tim Aspinall.<ref name=\"Little. 2000 p.28\">Little.

I'm just doing a job, not acting. The scriptwriters have turned me into Ernie Bishop. I've tried to resist it but it is very hard not to play the part all the time, even at home.' ''<ref>Little. (2000) p.114.</ref>  This was the first sight the public had of a bitter argument between Hancock and Granada Television. Hancock objected to the cast payment system, and threatened to quit the show to safeguard his principles.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.33\">Podmore. p.33.</ref>  The main dispute was between Hancock and the show's producer at the time, [[Bill Podmore]], with Podmore being nicknamed 'The Godfather' by the British media.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.33\"/>\n\nThe basis of Hancock's argument was that different actors were guaranteed different numbers of episode appearances per year, thus some were paid more than others.  Actors from the earliest days of the programme, including [[Pat Phoenix]], [[Doris Speed]] and Peter Adamson, were guaranteed payment for every one of the year's episodes, regardless of whether or not they actually appeared.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.34\">Podmore. p.34.</ref>  Podmore was not willing to change what he called a 'complex and well-established system',<ref name=\"Podmore. p.34\"/> leading Hancock to stand by his principles and resign.\n\nThe problem now shifted, and writers had to write Ernie out but save his wife [[Emily Bishop|Emily]]. The decision was made for Ernest to be killed off in a bungled robbery at [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s factory, where he worked in payroll. Ernest was killed by a single gunshot to the stomach on 11 January 1978.<ref>Little. (2000) p.21.</ref>  It was the first time that violence on such a scale had been shown on ''Coronation Street'' and after the episode was aired, Granada's [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] was jammed by angry viewers. Letters of complaint arrived in their hundreds, and the Lobby Against TV Violence fiercely objected Granada's decision to broadcast the episode.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.33\"/>  Granada stated that the storyline was not about violence, but that it aimed to show the desolation and loss felt by Ernest's widow, Emily.<ref>Podmore. p.36.</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight years later, in 2006 [[Ed Jackson (Coronation Street)|Thomas Edward \"Ed\" Jackson]], known only as Ed, befriended Emily Bishop, having joined her church. Ed confessed to Emily that he was one of the men involved in the armed robbery, and that he had shot and killed her husband.\n\n===Death of Len Fairclough (1983)===\nPeter Adamson, who had played [[Len Fairclough]] since 1961,<ref>Little. p.10.</ref> was sacked in 1983 for [[breach of contract]]. He had been warned by Granada Television for writing unauthorised newspaper articles criticising the show and cast.  ''Coronation Street'' producer [[Bill Podmore]] sacked Adamson when it was revealed he had sold his memoirs ''after'' the previous warning.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.78\">Podmore. p.78.</ref>\n\nThe sacking coincided with allegations of Adamson having [[Indecent assault|indecently assaulted]] two young girls. In April 1983, a Sunday newspaper reported that Adamson had been arrested for indecently assaulting two eight-year-old girls at a swimming pool.<ref>Podmore. p.77.</ref> The police complaint was that Adamson's hands had strayed while giving the girls swimming lessons. Granada Television gave Adamson financial support through his legal problems, with a [[Crown Court]] jury finding him not guilty in July 1983.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.78\"/>\n\nAdamson's dispute over his memoirs and newspaper articles was not known to the public, and the media reported that Adamson had been dismissed because of the shame indecent assault allegations had brought onto Granada and the ''Coronation Street'' brand.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.78\"/>\n\nLen Fairclough was killed off-screen in a motorway crash on 7 December 1983. To demonise the character, it was revealed that he had been returning home from an affair, cheating on his wife [[Rita Sullivan|Rita]] ([[Barbara Knox]]).<ref>Little. p.153.</ref>\n\nAdamson celebrated the character's death by delivering an obituary on [[TV-am]] dressed as an [[undertaker]].<ref>Podmore. p.76.</ref>\n\n===Killing of Brian Tilsley (1988)===\nIn 1988, actor [[Christopher Quinten]], who had played [[Brian Tilsley]] since 27 December 1978,<ref>Little. p.121.</ref> told bosses at Granada that he was going to move to the United States to marry his then-fianc\u00e9e, American [[talk show]] host [[Leeza Gibbons]] and to build an acting career in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>Podmore. p.135.</ref>  In announcing his resignation, Quinten tried to ensure that his role would be left open for him to return in the event that his stint in America failed.\n\nAt the time, his character Brian Tilsley was married to [[Gail Platt|Gail]] ([[Helen Worth]]), and the story conference called to write Brian out struggled to find a justifiable way to write him out while still leaving enough scope for a possible return. The decision was made that Brian should die.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\">Podmore. p.136.</ref>\n\nQuinten was in Los Angeles when the storyline was decided, and upon his return to the United Kingdom, he was shocked at Brian's fate and threatened to fly back to America so that scenes could not be filmed.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\"/>  He was talked round by co-star Helen Worth, who pointed out that he might be blacklisted by [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] if he quit the programme abruptly.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\"/>\n\nBrian Tilsley's death was broadcast on 15 February 1989.  After the breakdown of his marriage to Gail, Brian started spending his evenings going to discos and meeting up with various women. He tried to protect a young lady from a group of thugs outside a nightclub, but was stabbed in the stomach. He died as a result of his injuries.<ref>Little. p.190.</ref>  The stabbing brought massive complaints from viewers, and [[Mary Whitehouse]] delivered an angry sermon about television violence.<ref name=\"Podmore. p.136\"/>\n\n===Sacking of Bruno Langley (2017)===\nIn October 2017, actor [[Bruno Langley]], who portrayed [[Todd Grimshaw]], was faced with allegations of sexual assault by two women who alleged that he groped them at a nightclub some years previously. Following an internal investigation, ''Coronation Street'' announced that Langley's contract with the show had been terminated, and consequently, Todd Grimshaw would be written out of the programme towards Christmas.\n\nLangley's sacking came at an unfortunate time. The character of Todd was set to become integral to a storyline involving his long-term romantic partner Billy Mayhew ([[Daniel Brocklebank]]) being outed as having a role in the death of former character Susan Barlow sixteen years previously; Susan was the mother of Todd's business partner Adam Barlow ([[Samuel Robertson]]). At the time Langley was sacked, Todd was set to be absent from the show over Christmas, having taken his and Billy's foster daughter Summer Spellman to safety when her bigoted grandmother is contacted by Susan's twin brother [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), after his attempt at scaring Billy goes horribly wrong and the latter plummets into a quarry. Initially, Todd and Summer were both set to return at some point after the New Year, but Langley's sacking threw those storyline plans into uncertainty. Instead, it was announced that the story would be rewritten, with Todd's mother [[Eileen Phelan]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) receiving a phone call from the police stating that Todd has gone on the run after assaulting a police officer.\n\nAt a court hearing in November 2017, Langley admitted to two counts of sexual assault. He was sentenced to a twelve-month community order and forty days of rehabilitation activity. Additionally, Langley was required to observe a curfew, wear an electronic tag, pay compensation to his victims and register as a sex offender. Langley blamed his actions on the stress of portraying a gay character in a soap opera, which caused an uproar among the public.\n\nHowever, many fans of ''Coronation Street'' called for Langley to be rehired by the show, with reasons ranging from his \"genuine remorse\" to the fact that he apologised for his actions. Langley's final appearance in the role aired in the episode dated 22 December 2017. As Langley hadn't filmed any official final scenes before his sacking, Todd's exit story involved a body double driving a car into the street and ordering the aforementioned Summer Spellman to get in, as Todd's mother Eileen looks on.\n\n==Controversial themes==\n===Sheila Birtles' suicide attempt (1963)===\nIn 1963, ''Coronation Street'' announced that the character of [[Sheila Birtles]] (Eileen Mayers) would commit suicide, after her husband [[Neil Crossley (Coronation Street)|Neil Crossley]] ([[Geoffrey Matthews]]) hit her in an angry rage. The public were outraged to hear of Sheila's suicide. Instead, the storyline was re-written so that the viewers only saw Sheila taking the pills and the screen faded into blackness. Actress Eileen Mayers stated that, \"It was disappointing, it was good and it wasn't shown\", referring to Sheila's suicide scenes. However, in 2011, the scenes were shown in the documentary series, ''The Corrie Years'', for the first time. Upon the announcement that the suicide scenes were to be shown 50 years later, a ''Coronation  Street'' insider said in an interview, \"At the time, it deemed controversial. But compared to what goes on in soap operas nowadays, I don't think the scenes will be very shocking\". Sheila's suicide attempt has been compared to that of [[Natasha Blakeman]]'s ([[Rachel Leskovac]]) in 2010 in the soap.\n\n===Valerie Barlow's attack (1968)===\nIn 1968, ''Coronation Street'' scriptwriters developed one of the programme's most dramatic storylines to date.<ref>Little. (1995) p.84.</ref> While Ken Barlow was working on a school play, his wife Valerie was kept hostage after a convicted rapist, Frank Riley, who had escaped from prison, forced his way into the Barlow flat.  The Barlow twins were asleep in their bed, with Valerie insisting that she was alone, only for one of the twins to wake up crying allowing Riley to use them as a threat to Valerie if she did not comply with his wishes. The story was spread across two episodes, the second seeing the police surround the Barlow flat and Riley tell Valerie that he might as well have some fun with her now he had been caught. The storyline saw a turning-point in the Barlow marriage, as Ken refused to believe that Valerie had not been raped.<ref>Little. (1995) p.85.</ref>\n\n===Parentage of Gordon Clegg (1974)===\nIn 1974, [[Irene Sutcliffe]] decided to leave the show, having played cornershop owner [[Maggie Clegg]] since 1 April 1968.<ref>Little. p.51.</ref>  Maggie emigrated to Zaire in 1974 with old flame Ron Cooke.  Susi Hush, the producer at the time, decided to write a storyline in which Gordon Clegg was revealed to be not the son of Maggie but the illegitimate son of her sister, [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Turpin]].<ref name=\"Little. p.93\">Little. p.93.</ref>\n\nSutcliffe made it known that she felt very hurt by the storyline, since she believed it tore apart the foundation of the character she had spent six years building.<ref name=\"Little. p.93\"/>  In an attempt to extend an olive branch in an informal apology, Hush invited Sutcliffe to return for Christmas festivities in a couple of episodes at the end of the year, which she accepted.\n\n===Deirdre Langton's attack (1977)===\nIn 1977, the writers of the show wrote a controversial storyline turn for actress Anne Kirkbride and her character, [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]]. In the story, Deirdre walked home from her exercise class and was attacked by a man who tried to [[rape]] her. He molested her, but she managed to run home. Filled with guilt and shame, she would not tell her husband, [[Ray Langton|Ray]], what had happened. Eventually, her thoughts turned to suicide. Deirdre decided to jump off a bridge, but was distracted when a passer-by asked for directions. At that time, she had an epiphany and told Ray what had transpired.\n\n===Ken, Deirdre and Mike (1982)===\nIn late 1982, writer [[Adele Rose]] came up with the idea that Deirdre, quickly bored in new marriage to Ken Barlow, would have an affair with Mike Baldwin. In Rose's line of reasoning, Deirdre would strongly believe that Ken was neglecting her, and that being with Mike would make her feel alive. In the widely viewed episode in which Deirdre confessed all to Ken, she told him that she felt like \"the wallpaper, or a piece of furniture that's been around forever... it's like [they've] been married for twenty years.\" In an unscripted move, Ken, blinded by anger, grabbed Deirdre by the throat and started to strangle her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/21/carla-rape-controversial-coronation-street-storyline|first=Kathy|last=Sweeney|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Coronation Street's most controversial storylines|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>  [[Anne Kirkbride]], who did not know of the sudden change in direction, reacted with more conviction, she admitted later, than had she known of the action beforehand. Eventually, Deirdre began to have doubts about staying with Mike Baldwin. The writers of the series scheduled the episode, in which Deirdre reconciled with Ken, effectively ending her relationship with Mike Baldwin, on the night that popular football teams [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.]] played at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]]. At the end of the episode, which aired on 23 February 1983, Deirdre slammed the door of No. 1 in Mike's face. Dejected and with a shattered hubris, Mike drove away from the Street. As soon as the credits finished rolling, the scoreboard at the stadium read \"Deirdre and Ken United Again!\" and \"Ken 1 Mike 0\" in big letters, to the excitement of cheering fans. The episode was one of the highest-rated in ''Corrie's'' history.\n\n===First transsexual person in a British soap opera (1998)===\nIn 1998, the Street introduced the first [[transsexual]] person in British soap history. Its handling of the story, and [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley Patterson]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) ultimately \"marrying\" bookish nerd Roy Cropper, proved immensely popular, and was praised by [[LGBT|transgender groups]], not least in how it highlighted [[transgender]] issues, such as how she remained registered for tax purposes as a man called \"Harold\", leading to ridicule from her boss, Mike Baldwin.\n\n''Coronation Street'' did not feature a gay resident until 2003, unlike ''EastEnders'' which had gay-themed storylines in the 1980s, and ''Emmerdale'' which has a lesbian vet and a number of other gay characters, both male and female. Recently the soap introduced its first lesbian couple, [[Sophie Webster]] and [[Sian Powers]].\n\n===Deirdre Rachid jailed (1998)===\nOn 29 March 1998, Deirdre Rachid was sent to prison after a former lover implicated her in a bank fraud scheme. A campaign led by tabloid newspapers and the occasional graffiti artist, with the slogan of \"''Free the Weatherfield One!''\", petitioned the Home Secretary to become involved on Deirdre's behalf. Even the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Tony Blair]] called for Deirdre to be freed. After three weeks, Deirdre was released from prison and four different newspapers claimed victory for themselves and their readers. However, the producers of the programme had planned the entire time for Deirdre to stay in prison for three weeks.\n\n===Illegal immigration (2007)===\nIn Spring 2007, ''Coronation Street'' began broadcasting one of its most politically sensitive storylines for some time with an illegal immigration storyline. Two [[Poles|Polish]] women were hired at the Underworld factory co-owned by Connor brothers [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) and [[Liam Connor|Liam]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]). The storyline included the police raiding the factory after receiving a tip off from a disgruntled [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]), only to declare all the Polish workers legal. However, it was discovered that another factory worker [[Joanne Jackson (Coronation Street)|Joanne Jackson]] ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]) was an illegal immigrant due to her being a [[Liberia]]n national, who was brought to Britain illegally by a relative when she was eight years old. This came as a shock to all the Underworld staff, but  especially Janice as she never intended to have one of her closest friends deported. Joanne was arrested and placed in a [[deportation]] centre as a result, but was released and was allowed to stay in the UK. She briefly returned to working at Underworld until she received a pay-off from new majority owner [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]); where Carla told her the firm was overstaffed.\n\n===Baby Freddie and the fire (2007)===\nIn May 2007, there was a problem surrounding the storyline which saw the burning of [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] and [[Claire Peacock]]'s house and the subsequent disappearance of baby [[Freddie Peacock|Freddie]].  The production team felt the storyline too closely reflected the [[disappearance of Madeleine McCann]] in Portugal which was ongoing simultaneously.  As a result of this, the storyline was shortened and rewritten.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Lara |title=Coronation Street axed child abduction plot as it would be too \"insensitive\" after Madeleine McCann disappearance |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-axed-child-abduction-10313898 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=Daily Mirror |date=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tony Gordon's escape from prison and the gun siege in ''Underworld'' (2010)===\nOver the week of 31 May-4 June 2010, it was intended to show an episode of ''Coronation Street'' each night where [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) had escaped from prison and was intending to take revenge on those who he had believed wronged him, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) and (by accident) [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), hostage at gunpoint in ''Underworld''. However, on 2 June 2010 in Cumbria, gunman [[Cumbria shootings|Derrick Bird]] went on a killing spree killing 12 people and injuring many others before turning on himself. As a mark of respect to the victims, the remaining episodes were pulled from the rest of the week and were rescheduled for the following week in double bills with the scheduled episodes of that week. The storyline followed Tony escaping from prison with his accomplice, former cellmate [[Robbie Sloan]] ([[James Fleet]]). Robbie tricks Carla into thinking he is a businessman and going into the factory alone with him. Robbie then held Carla at gunpoint and forced her to evacuate the factory premises. He then left her tied to a chair and gagged with duct tape while he lured Hayley into the factory too. Tony appeared, taking the tape off Carla's mouth allowing her to speak, while announcing his plans to murder them. Tony shoots dead Robbie, and Maria accidentally intrudes on the proceedings. Tony lets Maria go, and Carla pleads with him to let Hayley go, which he does, on the condition that she will die with him. Tony then sets fire to ''Underworld''. The storyline ended with Carla managing to untie herself and escaping but Tony perishing in the blaze.\n\n===Hayley Cropper's suicide (2013\u20132014)===\nIn July 2013, long-standing character [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) was diagnosed with stage-two [[pancreatic cancer]], and was told she must undergo two operations and [[chemotherapy]] to try and eliminate the cancer. In September, when she had her major operation, the consultant revealed that the cancer was incurable and that she was dying, devastating Hayley and her husband, [[Roy Cropper|Roy]] ([[David Neilson]]). During a conversation with Roy, Hayley decided that she wanted to end her life on her terms, meaning that she wanted to commit suicide when her pain became unbearable. Roy could not come to terms with Hayley's decision, and eventually lied to her that he was fine about her killing herself. By January 2014, Hayley was taking extremely strong painkillers and needing to travel in a wheelchair. On 20 January, Hayley said her goodbyes to her friends, and sat on her bed, with Roy by her side. She drank the lethal cocktail, which killed her within a few minutes. Roy and Hayley's friends [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) and [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) rushed up to their flat, where they found Hayley's corpse on the bed, with Roy's arm around her.\n\nThe public started the belief that the storyline was a \"right to die\" storyline <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/17/julie-esmondhalgh-assisted-suicide-coronation-street-hayley-cropper|date= 17 January 2014|accessdate=1 April 2020|title=Coronation Street and the right to die: why Hayley Cropper's story matter|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> but Hesmondhalgh later announced that it was not a \"right to die\" storyline, and merely a pancreatic cancer storyline.  The episode in which Hayley killed herself with Roy by her side attracted 9.7 million viewers, the show's largest figure in almost a year.  The storyline, Hesmondhalgh, and Neilson have won numerous awards.{{Vague|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Bethany Platt's sexual exploitation (2017)===\nIn December 2016, it was announced that [[Bethany Platt]]'s ([[Lucy Fallon]]) crush on her mother [[Sarah Platt|Sarah]]'s ([[Tina O'Brien]]) boyfriend [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) will reach some \"devastating consequences.\". After having a diet pill overdose and being rescued by [[List_of_Coronation_Street_characters_(2016)#Nathan_Curtis|Nathan Curtis]] ([[Christopher_Harper_(actor)|Christopher Harper]]), it was announced a month later that Bethany will be involved in a \"dark\" and \"nail biting sex ring storyline\" as articles say that Nathan will \"pimp her out to older friends.\" This storyline was created to highlight the issue of child [[sexual exploitation]], and was also inspired by the Rochdale sex ring, which occurred in 2012.\n\nBethany befriended Nathan after her rescue, and she began to do hair tutorial videos in his tanning salon. Bethany was charmed by Nathan's flirting, and after being informed by \"friend\" Mel Maguire ([[Sonia Ibrahim]]) that Nathan liked her, Bethany and Nathan began dating. Sarah was less than pleased to find out her daughter was dating a boy twice her age, but kept her true feelings aside in order to not lose her daughter.\n\nViewers expressed their discomfort of the storyline on [[Twitter]], and even the scene involving Bethany sleeping with Nathan was controversial. This caused [[Ofcom]] to view more upcoming scenes of the storyline, and they gave them the all clear.\n\n===Pat Phelan's killing spree (2017\u20132018)===\nIn the episode broadcast on 27 October 2017, the villainous character of [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) controversially caused the deaths of two characters; [[Vinny Ashford]] (Ian Kelsey) and [[Andy Carver]] (Oliver Farnworth) in scenes which were described as \"too dark and violent to air pre-watershed\".\n\nIn December 2016, Phelan blackmailed Andy in retaliation for the latter attacking him with a brick \u2014 as Andy had correctly suspected Phelan of causing the death of his late surrogate father, [[Michael Rodwell]] (Les Dennis). This culminated on the day of Phelan's wedding to [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) in 20 January 2017, when he brutally kidnapped Andy for attempting to expose his involvement in both Michael's death and the \"Calcutta Street\" flats scam development. After exploiting his girlfriend Steph Britton to leave Weatherfield, Phelan kept Andy in a cellar for months until the latter proposed that he find a \"replacement\" for him. At first Phelan refused, but while managing to stop local journalist Daniel Osbourne from investigating the truth about \"Calcutta Street\", he manages to track down his old crooked business partner Vinny Ashford \u2014 whose real name is Harvey McArdle. Upon seeking revenge on Vinny for his betrayal at the climax of their \"Calcutta Street\" scam operation, Phelan agrees to Andy's plan and blackmails Vinny in returning to Weatherfield \u2014 threatening to hurt his mother Flora otherwise. Vinny complies and delivers the money to Phelan, who subsequently kidnaps Vinny and instructs Andy to kill him in order to secure his freedom. After driving the pair to an abandoned mill, Phelan manipulates Andy into executing Vinny with a gun under the guise that ''he'' is responsible for Michael's death \u2014 not Phelan. Following Vinny's death, Phelan took the gun from Andy and turned it on him. Andy's attempts to bargain for his life were futile, as Phelan simply uttered: \"You don't know me at all\", before shooting Andy dead. Phelan supposedly did this because Andy \"wouldn't be able to live with himself\". \n\nIn the same episode, Phelan's daughter [[Nicola Rubinstein]] ([[Nicola Thorp]]) discovered her birth was in fact the result of a serious sexual assault committed by Pat against her late mother Annabel, twenty-eight years earlier. She subsequently disowned Phelan in response to this, as well as learning from the other night that he previously raped his archenemy [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) back in 2014.\n\nThe scenes prompted an almost immediate uproar from some fans, while others praised the show for \"bringing drama back to the Street\".\n\nOn 5 January 2018, Phelan would kill Steph's brother Luke Britton for investigating and unwittingly learning the truth about Andy's death. The broadcast of the episode had garnered 662 complaints to Ofcom and the show received an extraordinary backlash from fans on social media; though most of this was due to the fact that these scenes were broadcast pre-watershed, not because of the quality of the storyline.\n\n===David Platt\u2019s male rape ordeal (2018)===\nIn August 2017, producer Kate Oates announced that she was working on another controversial storyline, two months before [[Bethany Platt]]\u2019s ([[Lucy Fallon]]) child sexual exploitation storyline came to an end. Oates has expressed her fears about how viewers will take the subject of the storyline; \u201cI am still scared but I think that the trepidation that I feel about is useful. It\u2019s one of those storylines that makes you check what you are doing and it will make people talk about it \u2013 we will seek a lot of advice and we have talked about it a lot as a team. So it is a good thing that I feel a bit scared about it as it means that everything we do with it will be done in a very considered way and I hope that will come across.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, it was announced that Bethany\u2019s uncle [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) will become the victim of [[male rape]] by a new local mechanic named Josh, who will also get the street residents ready for a boxing match. The crew of the show will be working closely with male rape charity Survivors Manchester to make sure that the storyline is handled accurately. [[Manchester Evening News]] reported; \u201cThere won\u2019t be any sexually explicit scenes, what has happened to David will be implied by his reaction and behavior when he wakes up the next day and starts to remember some of what happened. With Josh still on the street, David struggles to deal with the shame of what has happened to him. This is a big storyline for Jack and everyone is determined to get it right.\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that the role of Josh was offered to actor Ryan Clayton; he made his first onscreen appearance during the episode broadcast on 26 January 2018. Josh arrived at Webster\u2019s Auto Center to apply for a job after the murder of local mechanic [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan). Josh decided to do a charity boxing match in honor of Luke\u2019s memory, and he later met David at the [[Rovers Return Inn]]. David later signed up to be a part of the boxing match, and later bonded with Josh during training sessions, which caused problems between him and his girlfriend [[Shona Ramsey]] ([[Julia Goulding]]).\n===Aidan Connor\u2019s suicide (2018)===\nIn May 2018, [[Aidan Connor]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) commits suicide after secret battling with depression. The song \u201c[[Cosmic Love]]\u201d by British indie-rock band [[Florence and the Machine]] played in Aidan\u2019s final scene on the show. The storyline highlights male suicide in the UK and to \u201cspeak out\u201d more about it and was highly praised throughout the media.\n\n==Major \"whodunnit\" storylines==\n===Who Killed Frank? (2012)===\nAfter he was found not guilty of raping [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), it was announced that [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]]'s ([[Andrew Lancel]]) departure from the soap would be centred across a murder mystery, which was broadcast in March 2012.\n\nPrior to his death, several people in Weatherfield had well-known reasons for wanting Frank dead with the investigation being focused on five main suspects.\n* [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), Frank's ex-fianc\u00e9e and rape victim, forced to sign off her share of the factory to Frank.\n* [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), [[Carla Connor]]'s lover, whose relationship was exposed in Frank's rape trial which resulted in estranged wife [[Leanne Battersby]] throwing him out of their house.\n* [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]), Frank's lover, found out she was being cheated on by Frank's business associate, [[Jenny Sumner]].\n* [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]), [[Sally Webster]]'s ex-husband, vowed to take revenge upon learning of Frank's infidelity.\n* [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), [[Carla Connor]]'s ex-sister-in-law determined to protect Carla from the wrath of Frank's bad deeds.\n\nShortly after officially signing the contract to take full control of Underworld, Frank was battered to death by a whisky bottle. The prime suspect was [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), and she was soon arrested after a DNA test revealed traces of her blood on the bottle.\n\nThe majority of viewers believed that all five suspects were innocent and that there would be an upcoming twist, revealing that [[Anne Foster]] ([[Gwen Taylor]]),  Frank's mother turned out to be the real killer. It was also leaked online that this was the upcoming plot twist. Anne Foster was revealed to have killed Frank after she found out that her son had indeed, raped Carla.\n\n===Who Kills Tina? (2014)===\nIn April 2013, [[Michelle Keegan]], who had played [[Tina McIntyre]] since 2008, decided to leave the soap. The show's bosses managed to persuade her to continue to appear in the show  until May 2014. In January 2014, it was announced that the character of Tina would be murdered.\n\nThe four suspects who could have killed Tina:\n* [[Carla Connor|Carla Barlow]] ([[Alison King]]), whose husband [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] had been having an affair with Tina.\n* [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), who had been threatened by Tina that she was going to tell his wife Carla about their affair.\n* [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), whose illegal dealings in her second-hand shop with her fianc\u00e9, [[Rob Donovan]], which Tina had uncovered.\n* [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]), who, like his fianc\u00e9e, [[Tracy Barlow]], wanted to keep Tina quiet about his illegal dealings and did not want Tina to tell his sister, [[Carla Connor|Carla]], about her affair with her husband, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]], as it could have effects on her unborn child.\n\nAll four endings were filmed but only one was chosen to be shown. All endings of characters pushing Tina off the balcony were posted on the programme's YouTube channel.\n\nIt was later announced that Tina would be pushed from a balcony to her death. Before the episode was aired on 27 May 2014, ''Coronation Street'' bosses confirmed that Tracy would not be Tina's killer, leaving only Peter, Carla and Rob in the frame. By the end of the episode, it was shown that Rob was Tina's murderer, after pushing her from the balcony unintentionally following an argument. In the following episode, it was revealed that Tina survived the fall, but when she threatened to tell the police that Rob deliberately pushed her in an attempt to kill her, Rob picks up a metal pipe and hits her on the head. Tina made her final appearance on 2 June 2014, where she died in hospital. Carla was considered a prime murder suspect, as Tina had been her husband's mistress; while Peter was also a possible suspect because Tina had threatened to reveal their affair to Carla. A few weeks after Tina's death, it was announced that [[Marc Baylis]], who plays Rob, would be leaving the soap. Rob left ''Coronation Street'' on 5 November 2014, after being caught and arrested for Tina's murder.\n\n===Who Attacked Ken? (2017)===\n{{Main|Who Attacked Ken?}}\nIn March 2017, a surprise \"[[whodunnit]]\" storyline took place when the soap's longest-serving character, [[Ken Barlow]], played by [[William Roache]], was pushed down the stairs of his home by an unknown assailant. After upsetting a majority of his family and certain locals, the media narrowed the suspects down to seven possible suspects:\n\n* [[Adam Barlow]], played by [[Sam Robertson]]. Earlier in March, Ken was disgusted with Adam when he realised that he had got involved in selling cocaine, so he shunned Adam and sent him back to [[Canada]]. Adam had always been paranoid that Ken does not see him as his grandson and solely as the son of his arch-enemy [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]), who had a highly publicised affair with Ken's late wife, [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]). When the attack took place, Adam was seen lurking around Weatherfield and got on a bus to leave town after Ken had been pushed.\n* [[Amy Barlow]], played by Elle Mulvaney. Amy was due to perform at a violin concert on the night of the attack, but went missing after she refused to participate. Tracy and her boyfriend, [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan), went looking for Amy, unknown that someone was spying on them. On 19 April 2017, she called DS MacKinnon to inform her of new evidence. A new kitchen worktop was fitted on the night of the attack, believing that Adam was the attacker. Amy had become a suspect in the investigation after calling DS MacKinnon ([[Sandra Huggett]]).\n* [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]], played by [[Chris Gascoyne]]. After seeing Peter arguing with a woman named [[List of Coronation Street characters (2017)#Chloe Tipton|Chloe Tipton]] ([[Jo-Anne Knowles]]) in the ginnel, Ken invited her back to his house, where she lied that she and Peter were having an affair, when really she was infatuated with him. Ken was disgusted by his son and informed his girlfriend [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), who moves out. After nearly turning to alcohol, Peter summarises that Ken is always at the heart of his problems, and tells Ken that he is dead to him before the attack.\n* [[Tracy Barlow]], played by [[Kate Ford]]. Ken's adoptive daughter and the daughter of his late-wife Deirdre, Tracy has always felt that Ken favours the rest of the family over her and her daughter, [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Elle Mulvaney). When Ken is having a discussion with Daniel's girlfriend [[Sinead Tinker]] (Katie McGlynn), Tracy and Amy are furious to hear Ken state that marrying Deirdre is one of his biggest regrets in life. After continuously refusing to help Tracy out financially, Ken apparently confirms Tracy's paranoia by not attending Amy's violin concert. Tracy is seen looking guilty outside the florist when the attack took place.\n* [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]], played by [[Rob Mallard]]. Ken's youngest son who returned to Weatherfield following his stroke in October 2016. Daniel and Ken share a good relationship, however was not impressed by Ken's pushy attitude for him to attend [[Oxford University]]. After his girlfriend Sinead aborts his unborn baby, Daniel realises that Ken manipulated her into doing so, in order for Daniel to go to Oxford and to fulfil one of his wishes. Daniel has an aggressive side, and is very secretive about what really happened to his mother, [[Denise Osbourne|Denise]] ([[Denise Black]]). When Ken is pushed down the stairs, Daniel arrives at the house to find [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) standing over him.\n* [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]], played by Connor McIntyre. Phelan had been doing a conversion job in Ken's kitchen for some weeks prior to Ken being pushed. After informing Ken that he would have to extend the job, Ken snaps with mounting pressure from his family - raging that Phelan is untrustworthy eue to how he sparked the events of their community's most recent ordeal - the Calcutta Street scam development, which left the majority of Ken's closest friends and neighbors defrauded by Phelan and his business partner [[Vinny Ashford]] ([[Ian Kelsey]]) as a result. In the ensuing outcome of the Calcutta Street ordeal, Phelan ended up causing the death of his love rival [[Michael Rodwell]] ([[Les Dennis]]) and later abducted his surrogate son [[Andy Carver]] ([[Oliver Farnworth]]) - thus leaving Ken unaware of Phelan's darker nature despite already figuring out about his responsibility behind the Calcutta Street incident. On the night of Ken's attack, Phelan was caught by Daniel standing over Ken when he was pushed down the stairs.\n* [[Sinead Tinker]], played by Katie McGlynn. Ken was unhappy with his son Daniel's fast relationship with Sinead, and was concerned when he found out that Daniel had turned down a place at Oxford University. After confronting Sinead, she revealed that she was pregnant with Daniel's baby. Ken coldly manipulated Sinead into aborting the baby to help Daniel, while also insulting his late wife Deirdre, overheard by Deirdre's daughter Tracy and granddaughter Amy. When Sinead is forced to tell Daniel the truth, he breaks up with Sinead, so she gets excessively drunk and is seen banging on Ken's door to angrily confront him before Ken is attacked.\n\nThe storyline was not announced until after the episode where Ken was attacked was broadcast. Since then, other possible suspect have emerged, such as Ken's adoptive granddaughter Amy after hearing him insulting her late grandmother Deirdre; Peter's stalker Chloe in an attempt to frame Peter for the attack and the theory that Amy and Adam worked together after Amy was seen making a mysterious phonecall before the attack, and Tracy makes a discovery involving Adam and Ken's will.\n\n[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] released a poll to the ''Coronation Street'' website so fans could share their thoughts of who pushed Ken. Fans and viewers used the pool, with the majority's believing the attacker to be Adam Barlow, with other suspects being; Daniel Osbourne, Pat Phelan, Sinead Tinker, Peter Barlow and Tracy Barlow. The polls changed after Pat Phelan was cleared and found to be innocent, and Amy Barlow became a suspect. The polls currently{{When|date=May 2017}} stand at:\n* Adam Barlow \u2013 36%\n* Amy Barlow \u2013 32%\n* Daniel Osborne \u2013 13%\n* Sinead Tinker \u2013 10%\n* Tracy Barlow \u2013 5%\n* Peter Barlow \u2013 4%\n\nOn 27 March 2017, Ken is found lying lifeless at the bottom of the stairs, with his youngest son, Daniel, walking in to find Phelan standing over him. The ambulance then arrives and Ken is rushed to hospital. The residents initially believe that Ken has suffered another stroke which caused the fall, however, the doctors contact the police after finding a legion on the back of Ken's head; indicating that he was struck with a blunt instrument which led to him falling down the stairs. Daniel, Tracy and Peter are all questioned by the police, with Tracy convincing her boyfriend [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan) to tell them that he was with her all night. Adam is also interviewed, however refuses to cooperate with inquiries and answer any questions. Both Daniel and Tracy informed the police of Ken's fraught relationship with Phelan, who was arrested for the attempted murder. However, [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) had CCTV footage proving that Phelan could not possibly have attacked Ken, which he handed into the police. When Ken regained consciousness, the police inform him that a family member could have potentially attacked him after he is suffering from memory loss, and therefore refuses to see his relatives. Tracy begins to suspect Adam after seeing him discretely talking to Amy, while the police close in on Daniel after he did not report his mother, Denise, missing for six years, believing him to be hiding something. Tracy finds Ken's final will, and finds that she has been completely cut out of it, with only Adam, Daniel and Peter inheriting Ken's assets. Confused, she confronts Adam and threatens to take it to the police, however he states that it gives her a motive to have attacked Ken. Peter's son [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]) finds a voicemail on his mobile phone from Peter, sounding very frantic and apologetic, and suspects that it is linked to Ken's attack. However, Peter tells Simon, Toyah and the rest of his family that he was visiting Chloe, and an altercation lead to her face being cut. Peter later visits her to ask her to be his alibi, however Chloe lies to the police that Peter assaulted her and that this occurred on a separate night to when Ken was pushed down the stairs.\n\n==Other major storylines==\n===The train crash (1967)===\nIn 1967, one of Coronation Street's biggest storylines took place, when the viaduct collapsed after a train derailed and fell into the street. Many of the show's popular characters including [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]) and [[Jack Walker (Coronation Street)|Jack Walker]] ([[Arthur Leslie]]) were feared dead but survived. One person died in the ordeal. It was this storyline, and its limits because of filming outdoor scenes in the studio, that prompted the Street's bosses to create an outdoor set. The storyline was repeated in 2010 to celebrate the soap's 50th Anniversary only this time it was a tram rather than a train crashing into the street.\n\n===Death of Valerie Barlow (1971)===\n[[Anne Reid]] joined the cast of ''Coronation Street'' in August 1961 on a temporary basis. She left the soap in November but her character had been popular, especially the storyline centred around her and [[Ken Barlow]]'s ([[William Roache]]) romance. She returned in June 1962 and on 1 August she married Ken. Over the next eight years fans would watch their stories, including two separations, the birth of twins, and Valerie's affair with Ken's best friend. Ken and Valerie were a very early example of a television [[supercouple]]. But late in 1970, Anne Reid asked to be released from her contract. She had married one of the soap's producers and was pregnant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The show's main producer reluctantly agreed and Valerie was killed off on 27 January 1971 in one of the show's most famous episodes. She died of a massive electric shock whilst plugging in her faulty hairdryer with wet hair and hands. The story had wide media coverage and many angry viewers wrote to Granada. On 3 February 1971 more than 15 million viewers tuned in for Valerie's funeral.\n\n===The Rovers Return fire (1986)===\nThe programme moved to modernise its sets in 1986. Its producers and writers chose to do this by having [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]] set ablaze on-screen, then re-built.\n\n[[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]) was on the upper storey of the pub when the fire broke out. [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) and [[Sally Webster|Sally Seddon]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]), coming home from a late-night rock concert, happened to walk past at the time, noticed the fire, and alerted the neighbours. The fire brigade eventually rescued Bet when Kevin could not, and she later recovered from smoke inhalation.\n\n[[Vera Duckworth]] ([[Elizabeth Dawn|Liz Dawn]]) remarked sarcastically that she was \"probably smokin' in bed again,\" when in reality, [[Jack Duckworth]] ([[Bill Tarmey]]) had attempted to repair a fuse and, in failing to do so, accidentally sparked a fire in the fusebox which spread to the rest of the establishment.\n\nFollowing the fire's devastation, The Brewery decided to knock The Rovers' main bar area, the Select, and the Snug into one larger bar making the interior set match the size of the outdoor set more closely. It has stayed the same layout ever since, but its wallpaper and fittings were updated in 2008.\n\n===The serial killer: Richard Hillman (2002\u201303)===\nIn 2002\u201303, ''Coronation Street'' featured a storyline of the show's would-be villain: [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]) \u2014 who entered as a relative of the late [[Alma Halliwell]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]). Initially the character was seen offering financial advice to residents and buying the house of [[Emily Bishop]] ([[Eileen Derbyshire]]), in an arrangement where she would have the right to live in it for her lifetime, but on her death, Hillman would inherit the house. He then married [[Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]). Over the months, questions were raised about his trustworthiness, with suggestions of some irregularities in his dealings with people elsewhere. He left his business partner, [[Duggie Ferguson]] ([[John Bowe (actor)|John Bowe]]) to die after falling over a balcony. Hillman then murdered his second wife, [[Patricia Hillman|Patricia]], ([[Annabelle Apsion]]) and buried her under concrete at a housing development he owned. In late 2002, Hillman subtly made his wealthy mother-in-law, [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]), question whether she was experiencing the onset of dementia, through such things as unlocking doors she had locked, hanging out washing that she could not remember hanging out, turning on lights she had switched off and taking a dress in to be dry-cleaned, which she could not remember taking. Finally, he tried to kill her in a [[structure fire|house fire]], made to look like the result of her [[dementia]], with Hillman removing the battery from the smoke alarm. She was saved by her friend, undertaker [[Archie Shuttleworth]] ([[Roy Hudd]]) and taxi driver [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]).\n\nIn 2003, Hillman was in severe financial trouble, and failing in his attempt to get his hands on Audrey's considerable wealth, he planned to murder Emily and thus claim her house. While Emily was babysitting [[Joshua Peacock]] ([[Benjamin Beresford]]), he planned to kill her and frame his stepdaughter, [[Sarah Platt|Sarah-Louise]]'s former boyfriend, Aiden Critchley, who was sleeping rough nearby. Hillman broke into the Peacock's house and struck Emily round the head with a crowbar, but unfortunately [[Maxine Peacock]] ([[Tracy Shaw]]) returned to check on her son, and Hillman brutally attacked her with the crowbar. Maxine died instantly, but Emily survived.\n\nFollowing Maxine's murder, February 2003 saw a number of street residents, along with Audrey, suspect Hillman of Maxine's murder, with Audrey challenging him at Maxine's funeral. Audrey had realised he had made two slip ups with her; knowing there was no battery in a smoke alarm before the fire brigade had checked it, and leaving in the dress to be cleaned on a day when she had independent witnesses to confirm that she had been with them all that day. She managed to convince Archie of Hillman's nefarious schemes (the undertaker had been suspicious of Richard when he was quick to identify a woman's body as that of Patricia, only to be mistaken afterwards). Emily's lodger [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) had also suspected that Richard was less-than honest in his financial dealings with his elderly clients. Meanwhile, [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]), having seen the drunken state of Aidan on the night of the murder, doubted his ability to carry out the crime. However, Audrey, Archie, Norris and Ken were boycotted by other residents, especially Hillman's wife, Gail, who became estranged from her mother, Audrey, after she accused him of lighting the fire in her house. Maxine's family and Emily (who survived with no memory of the attack) all saw Hillman as a perfect husband, neighbour and friend.\n\nHillman himself was racked by guilt at his actions, all the more so when it turned out that someone ''else'' whose house he owned had died the previous week, meaning that his financial problems were already solved ''before'' he tried to murder Emily and murdered Maxine. Hillman's trusting wife, Gail, finally twigged and challenged him, leading to his full and frank admission, in the belief that she would stand by him and not reveal his actions. She however refused to protect him and Hillman disappeared, pursued by the police, who eventually found his second wife's body.  He returned to kidnap his family and try to gas them in the family car, before being discovered, and driving off and crashing the car into a canal, where Hillman died but Gail, Sarah, David and Bethany survived. In the aftermath, Hillman's financial dealings saw his wife and family face the possible loss of their home, as did Emily, while the Duckworths lost their entire life savings.\n\n===Mad Maya (2004)===\nIn 2004, [[Maya Sharma]] ([[Sasha Behar]]) was unceremoniously dumped by her boyfriend, Corner Shop owner [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]). He discovered that his all-time love [[Sunita Alahan|Sunita Parekh]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]) had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]. Maya who had shown glimpses of her true self on a few previous occasions including dog-napping [[Tyrone Dobbs]]' ([[Alan Halsall]]) pet greyhound Monica and dumping it on the Red Rec, stealing an expensive vase on impulse from a designer shop, and driving high speed with Dev into the countryside in her characteristic red MG sports car, refusing to stop until he proposed to her, was hell-bent on revenge. She trashed the apartment he shared with her in Weatherfield Quays causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.\n\nShe disappeared for a few weeks but returned, posing as Sunita entering into illegally arranged marriages to immigrants seeking residency in the UK. She then tipped off the police and had both Sunita and Dev arrested on their wedding day in front of most of the Street's shocked residents with Maya lurking in the background.\n\nMaya then began a campaign of destruction against Dev's business empire. One of his employees working in his Eccles shop called Dev saying it was on fire. It soon became clear his shops were being targeted and Dev knew from that point on that Maya was behind the arson attacks. He soon realised that Sunita herself might be in danger and when he called home his worst fears were realised when Maya answered the phone saying she had Sunita hostage. When Dev returned to the apartment he discovered Maya and Sunita were nowhere to be seen and he drove straight to the remaining shop not yet targeted, the Coronation Street shop in Weatherfield. Maya tied up Sunita in the upstairs flat (No. 15A) and when Dev entered she hit him over the head with a fire extinguisher. She then tied and gagged them both before turning on the gas on the cooker in the flat, before moving downstairs and starting a fire in the shop itself. They were rescued by [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) and [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) as the building sensationally exploded in a large ball of flame which led to the panic stricken Websters evacuating their house next door and all the residents of Coronation Street rushing outside to a scene of utter devastation. With her first attempt to kill her former fianc\u00e9 and his lover thwarted, in desperation she tried to run down the couple in front of virtually all the Street residents but missed and crashed into the viaduct. While attempting a second try her MG was shunted by a refuse truck and forced into a small business on Viaduct Street leading to her being seriously injured.\n\nBoth Dev and Sunita survived the ordeal and Maya was admitted to hospital under police guard.\n\n===The murder of Charlie Stubbs (2007)===\nIn January 2007, [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) was killed by former lover [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]).\nThe storyline had started when Tracy had claimed to neighbours that she was being domestically abused by Charlie, persuading [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) to keep a diary of the \"attacks\" on Tracy, which she'd inflicted herself. The murder itself was ''planned'' when Tracy had found out that Charlie had been having an affair with fellow street resident, [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]). The murder, involved Tracy knocking him out with an ornament, and then carelessly placing a knife, to make it look like self-defence. [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]), [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) and [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) at this point, rushed over to the house, to try to find out what was happening. Getting no answer at the door, Peter forces the door down, revealing a \"shocked\" Tracy on the phone to the police. The police arrived later, along with an ambulance, revealing Charlie still alive at this point. Tracy was at this moment disturbed by it, however, she is relieved when Charlie later dies in hospital.\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Tracyincourt.JPG|thumb|150px| Tracy's guilty!]] -->\nAfter the murder, [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) claimed that he had seen the murder, and claimed it was indeed self-defence. It was revealed that he wanted to use Tracy for sex, which he never did do, as the outcome was guilty.\nThe trial was aired from March until April 2007 in which [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] had filmed two different endings; the outcomes  were that she was to be found guilty or not guilty. She was found guilty by the jury, even with David's testimony \u2013 and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of fifteen years.\n\n===Liam Connor's murder and Tony Gordon's relationship with Maria (2008)===\nIn October 2008, after discovering [[Liam Connor]]'s ([[Rob James-Collier]]) affair with his then fianc\u00e9e, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) \u2013 Liam's ex-sister-in-law \u2013 [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) ordered his henchman, [[Jimmy Dockerson]] ([[Robert Beck (actor)|Robert Beck]]) to run over Liam at his stag night. Tony held Liam in his arms as he died.\n\nAt Carla and Tony's wedding, a drunken [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) showed Liam's widow, [[Maria Connor|Maria]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) footage of Liam and Carla kissing on her daughter, [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]]'s ([[Helen Flanagan]]), mobile phone. Maria then became convinced that Tony had killed Liam, even trying to run Tony over in her car.\n\nIn 2009, Carla became suspicious of her husband after [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]), who Tony had previously attacked, showed her marks on his neck from where Tony had strangled him. Tony finally confessed to Carla he murdered Liam; Carla made a dramatic exit.\n\nFilled with remorse, Tony visited tearfully visited Liam's grave. Maria saw Tony and he gave her a lift home. The pair began a gradual friendship, with Tony moving in with Maria whilst she was pregnant.\n\nIn June 2009, Tony helped Maria deliver her baby, which she named Liam. When Maria's in-laws visited their grandson, Tony moved out, but the pair realised how much they could not be without each other and gave in to temptation, kissing passionately.\n\nSince then, they had been a happy couple and became engaged on the date of Liam's death. Carla learned of their engagement from Leanne and threatened to expose Tony to the police if he didn't leave Maria. However, when she attacked Tony's henchman Jimmy and thought him to be dead, Tony turned the tables and told Carla to leave if she didn't want to end up in prison.\n\nIn November 2009, Tony suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) found him in the street and saved him. Roy refused to leave Tony's side at the hospital, and they talked all night. Tony then suffered another heart attack, and grabbed Roy, confessing, \"I killed Liam Connor.\" Roy then began stalking Tony, acting as his \"conscious\", insisting he tell Maria everything. Furious, Tony threatened to kill Roy and his wife, [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]). Hayley and Roy then reported Tony to the police.\n\nTony was taken in for questioning, but released due to lack of evidence. Roy, believing Tony was in police custody, went to the canal to do some bat-watching. Tony confessed to Maria he'd been questioned by the police over Liam's murder. Scared, Maria left. When she returned, Tony was gone \u2013 he was at Roy's Rolls, hiding behind the counter with a knife in his hand. Maria arrived at the caf\u00e9 and begged Hayley to tell her what was going on, to which Hayley admitted Tony killed Liam. As Maria sobbed, Tony was shown silently crying, digging the knife into his hand.\n\nOnce it was safe to leave, Tony went to the canal and taunted Roy, implying he had murdered Hayley by revealing the knife when Roy asked what he'd done to his wife. Roy then took Tony by surprise, attacking Tony. Tony then pushed Roy into the canal and watched him sink to the bottom from the bridge above. As Tony was about to leave, guilt sank in and he dived into the canal and rescued Roy. After giving him the kiss of life, Roy coughed up water. Tony asked Roy if he was all right, then left and handed himself in to the police.\n\nMaria found out Tony was at the police station and demanded to see him. She then asked Tony why he did it, then asked if her or baby Liam was planned to be next. Tony insisted he'd never lay a finger on the baby, and said he regretted what he did to Liam but regretted what he'd done to her even more. Maria then told Tony baby Liam was nothing to do with him, and that if there was any justice in the world he'd be hanged. She said she'd stand and watch and cheer, then dance on his grave afterwards. The police officer then told Maria her time with Tony was up. As she left, Tony called to Maria that he loved her. Outside, Maria began to sob. Inside the cell, Tony began crying too.\n\n===The tram crash (2010)===\nIn Summer 2010, to celebrate the show's 50th anniversary, it was reported that the street would be at the centre of a \"major disaster\". It was later announced by producer [[Phil Collinson]] that a tram would crash into the cobbles and the resulting incident will change everyone's lives forever.\n\nThe storyline aired across the entire birthday week, 6\u201310 December, with a special live episode broadcast on 9 December.\n\nThe storyline saw the deaths of [[Ashley Peacock]] ([[Steven Arnold]]), crushed by falling debris in the remains of The Joinery, [[Molly Dobbs]] ([[Vicky Binns]]), who died of internal injuries when waiting to be rescued from the Corner Shop rubble and [[Charlotte Hoyle]] ([[Becky Hindley]]), who was struck on the head by a hammer from [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]) in the minutes leading up to the tram crash and later declared brain dead. The fourth death was an unknown taxi driver, which caused outrage with fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2010/12/15/coronation-streets-four-funerals-and-a-wedding-tag-line-deemed-a-cop-out-612855/|title=Coronation Street\u2019s \u2018four funerals and a wedding\u2019 tag-line deemed a \u2018cop-out|date=15 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe drama is set on the night of [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]'s ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) hen and stag parties ahead of their wedding the next day. On that night, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), who had been having an affair with Leanne, ushered Peter into his office of The Joinery bar, with the intention of revealing all. Molly decided to leave her husband [[Tyrone Dobbs|Tyrone]] ([[Alan Halsall]]), however, when he refused to allow her to leave with baby [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]], was forced to reveal to him that he wasn't the boy's father but didn't name [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]) as his actual biological father. As a result, a devastated Tyrone allowed her to leave with him and she headed to the corner shop to say her goodbyes. [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) discovered that her nephew [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max Turner]] had gone missing resulting in her and her husband [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) frantically combed the Street searching for him.\n\nBut just before Nick can tell Peter his shocking secret, a sudden explosion rips through the building as a result of a gas leak, trapping the pair and Ashley Peacock. The resulting force of the explosion also severely damaged the above viaduct, resulting in a nearby tram derailing, despite the best efforts of the tram driver to bring it to a stop beforehand, and crashed into the Alahan's Corner Shop, injuring [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]) along with Molly and baby Jack. After a moment of suspense, one of the carriages tipped down and smashed into ''The Kabin'', with [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) being crushed by a falling shelf case. The crash also set No. 13 Coronation Street, the Peacock's home, on fire, trapping [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]), her two children, [[Freddie Peacock|Freddie]] (Niall Beresford) and [[Joshua Peacock|Joshua]] ([[Benjamin Beresford]]), their friend [[Russ Gray|Russ]] (Finton Flynn), and [[Simon Barlow]] (Alex Bain). A telegraph pole is also struck down in the carnage, knocking out the electricity across the street.\n\nThe initial blast briefly knocks several people out cold and with emergency services delayed due to a motorway traffic accident, the residents began the rescue efforts. [[Lloyd Mullaney]] ([[Craig Charles]]) manages to save Claire, her children and Russ from their burning house before [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) ventures inside to search for Simon. During the furore, [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) is caught in the debris and goes into premature labour. Her husband, John, is warned that if ambulances don't come sooner and if Fiz isn't able to stop the contractions, both she and the baby will die.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, fire crews, police and ambulances finally arrive on the scene and relieve the residents of their work. The first casualties, Sunita and Fiz, are taken to hospital whilst Molly's baby Jack is pulled out from the rubble of the corner shop and Jason is able to get Simon out the Peacocks' house. Meanwhile, Becky and Steve frantically continue to search for Max but soon find themselves in trouble when Max's mother [[Kylie Platt|Kylie]] ([[Paula Lane]]) unexpectedly turns up. Rita remained trapped in the remains of ''The Kabin'' and was undiscovered as everyone thought she had gone out for the evening with a friend, not realising that her friend had cancelled resulting in Rita deciding to stay in for the night.\n\nInside the remains of The Joinery, Nick and Ashley continue to struggle in getting a seriously wounded Peter to safety. Rescue workers are able to locate them in time and quickly pull Peter out and into a waiting ambulance. Weakened by the fumes and dust, Ashley tells Nick to get out immediately, sacrificing his life for him. Nick reluctantly does so, just as the roof of the building caves in and collapses on top of Ashley, resulting in his death.\n\nThe drama continued throughout a special live episode, broadcast on 9 December, the soap's date of birth 50 years ago. The 60-minute instalment saw Fiz give birth to a baby girl 3 months premature; John attempting to hide the body of Charlotte, whom he had supposedly killed in the second 6 December episode only to be caught by the police, but got away as he had already discarded the evidence however he was horrified to discover she was still alive; Claire attempting to cope with the devastating news of Ashley's death; [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) opening up over his refusal to help out as it reminded him about the trauma he suffered when on his army tour of duty in Afghanistan; Kylie admitting to Steve and Becky that she had removed Max and, after already spending the \u00a320,000 they had given her so they could keep him, demanding another payment of \u00a35,000 from them if they wanted him returned; Molly telling [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) the truth about baby Jack's father before succumbing to her injuries and Peter marrying Leanne before suffering a [[cardiac arrest]] as the episode ended.\n\nAs the tragic situation continued to unfold, Peter was rushed into emergency surgery which was successful but still remained critically ill. Peter then married Leanne while in critical condition, with Carla watching on, in the fear that he wouldn't recover to wed her properly. John made an attempt to switch off Charlotte's life support machinery and nearly got caught by her parents and John passed himself off as [[Colin Fishwick]] ([[David Crellin]]), who died during a heated argument with John and Charlotte back in July. John later got his wish when doctors declared Charlotte as brain dead.\n\nLeft stunned by the claims of Kevin cheating on her, Sally was left devastated when she forced Kevin to admit all. Upon learning that Kevin had planned to leave her before discovering she had cancer the previous Christmas she told him their marriage was over. Meanwhile, Tyrone pledged to Kevin that he would continue to care for baby Jack despite not being his true father, but swore revenge on the man who Molly had an affair with and got her pregnant not realising it was Kevin himself. Meanwhile, after having been trapped inside ''The Kabin'' for several hours with no notice, Rita was finally found and taken to hospital. The night's activity ended with most of the residents sleeping inside The Rovers Return as the police had cordoned off their houses.\n\nITV released the entire week of episodes on DVD release on 21 February 2011.<ref>http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/18438376/Coronation-Street-Tram-Crash/Product.html</ref>\n\n===Fire at Victoria Court (2015)===\nIn April 2015, it was announced that a huge fire would break out at the Victoria Court flats, after an unnamed person, living nearby to the ''Coronation Street'' set, dialled 999 after discovering a fire on the premises. The storyline was played out in May 2015, as the soap temporarily moved to a 9pm post-watershed slot to accommodate the live semi-finals of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', which has been the case each year for one week since 2010.\n\nAfter being thwarted by [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) in her sly attempts to take control of The Rovers Return in May, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) swears to take revenge on everyone that have ruined her plans. She first confesses to [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]), at her son [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) and [[Michelle Connor]]'s ([[Kym Marsh]]) wedding reception, that she had been having an affair with [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), as part of her plot the purchase the pub. She then heads into Carla's flat at Victoria Court, and briefly considers murdering her whilst she slept on the sofa, before instead lighting a candle and leaving it next to a lampshade.\n\nCarla's flat is soon engulfed in flames, but she is quickly rescued by [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]). Carla then reveals that Tracy's daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Elle Mulvaney) is still inside and both Leanne and her boyfriend [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]) go back inside to find her. As concerned onlookers soon arrived to help out, Leanne and Amy are helped to safety, with Leanne agreeing to marry Kal, having proposed to her shortly before the fire. Suddenly, a gas cylinder ignites on the balcony and the flat erupts in a huge fireball. Kal is pronounced dead at the scene, after he was still trapped on the balcony at the time of the explosion.\n\nWhilst the fire erupted, [[Jenny Bradley]] ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) made an attempt to snatch [[Kevin Webster]]'s ([[Michael Le Vell]]) son [[Jack Webster (Coronation Street)|Jack]], only to be thwarted by an unsuspecting [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]). As she made her way to her way to the scene of the fire to tell her girlfriend [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]), the pair had recently agreed to rent a flat to live in together, a second explosion erupted at the nearby builders' yard, caused by a stray flame that ignited a batch of flammable chemicals. Maddie took the full force of the blast, being knocked unconscious and left severely injured. She never regained consciousness and later died in hospital from head injuries sustained by the blast.\n\nCarla started drinking and gambling heavily after the fire, feeling that she was responsible. She goes to a quarry to drown her sorrows, taking Tracy with her, and, when Carla was about to commit suicide, Tracy confessed. Carla exposes Tracy as the culprit in the Rovers and gets her arrested. Tracy is released without charge due to lack of evidence. Underworld, which suffered heavily because of Carla's gambling, had to be bailed out by [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley]]).\n\n===Callum terrorises the Platts (2015)===\nDrug dealer [[Callum Logan]] (Sean Ward), the biological father of [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max Turner]] (Harry McDermott), harasses the Platt family for custody of Max for several months. He particularly antagonises [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]), due to his remarks about Max's mother and David's wife, [[Kylie Platt|Kylie]] ([[Paula Lane]]). Callum begins a relationship with [[Sarah Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]), to the Platts' dismay. Callum manipulates Sarah's teenage daughter [[Bethany Platt]] ([[Lucy Fallon]]) to buy drugs for him whilst he films her. Sarah splits up with Callum in August 2015 after Max finds a gun in his bedroom in Callum's flat. Callum shows Sarah the footage of Bethany buying the drugs. Sarah warns Bethany to stay away from Callum.\n\nCallum wins custody of Max later that month, and Sarah confides in [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) that he is harassing her and Bethany. Jason enters the Rovers and warns Callum to stay away from Sarah and Bethany, throwing his drink onto his lap. At the same time, Sarah has Callum arrested for the gun. However, Max mistakenly tells the police that the gun was a toy and Callum is released. Callum promises Sarah that he will destroy the Platt family and Jason promises to get rid of him. After David refuses to let Callum see Max, Callum pins David up against a wall, Jason then stops him and throws him onto the street threatening him to stay away from the Platts or he will be dealt with. A furious Callum enlists two thugs to severely beat Jason up, which is witnessed by Max. Jason is discovered by Sarah and rushed to hospital, where his parents [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard) are told he might lose the use of his legs and speech. Max tells David and Kylie what he saw, and when Jason regains consciousness he reinforces Max's story. Max is interviewed by the police, but Callum drugs Sarah, threatening Bethany with the help of [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell) to give him a false alibi or he will kill Sarah. The police believe Bethany and the Platts are furious when Bethany announces she lied to the police for Callum. Tony promises revenge and drags Callum into the ginnel and beats him up severely, but he is stopped by [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]).\n\nCallum kidnaps Max the following month and shouts at him when he demands to go home. Callum is under pressure to pay off a drugs supplier and forces the Platts to pay him \u00a320,000. They immediately refuse and Callum leaves but promises to return for the money. Jason goes to Callum's flat where he punches him. Callum then returns to the Platts and asks them if they sent Jason and Tony to his flat, however they deny having anything to do with it. Callum then states that he will ruin their lives until he is paid. Kylie slaps Callum in the caf\u00e9 and he gets his thugs to terrorise [[Audrey Roberts]] ([[Sue Nicholls]]) in her salon. Callum then trashes the Platt household and, when he returns, he faces Kylie who tries to call the police on Callum, but he stops her. He then intimidates her for the money but Gail throws Callum out of the house. He pushes Max in front of [[Nick Tilsley]]'s ([[Ben Price]]) van after Max hurts Callum by saying that David is his father and that he hates him. Max injures his leg in the accident. Soon after, Bethany confesses that she was forced to give a false alibi for Callum to the police after he threatened her by drugging Sarah and saying that he would kill her. The Platts tell Bethany to tell the police the truth about Callum and soon after in the bistro Callum shows up and asks about Max. Kylie then annoys Callum and he gets violent just as the police walk in and arrest him for assaulting Jason and perverting the course of justice. He is released on bail and tells David and Kylie that he'll leave them alone if he gets his money. David goes looking for money but can't make enough for Callum's demands in time. He then goes after Callum with his mind set on ending the war between the Platts and Callum. Sarah goes into the Rovers and finds Kylie. She tells her David has gone to find Callum which leaves Sarah panicking. As Kylie goes to the toilet, Sarah uses her phone and texts Callum saying she has the money and to meet her at the house. Sarah records Callum in the Platt house talking about his evil deeds. Callum finds her phone recording and after asking where David and Kylie and if they have the money, Sarah says they can't get that kind of money and Callum starts to torture her. When Sarah tries to escape the house, Callum pins her down on the floor and begins to rape her, only to be stopped when Kylie bludgeons him with a wrench, instantly killing Callum. They dump his corpse in a manhole in Gail's annex, which gets covered by cement. Sarah is left traumatised.\n\nAfter her ordeal, Sarah gives birth to Callum's child, [[Harry Platt (Coronation Street)|Harry Platt]], and is constantly concerned about his safety. She becomes mentally unstable, slowly developing [[postpartum psychosis]], and begins to believe Callum is still alive. She is then admitted to a psychiatric ward when her illness worsens.\n\nIn May 2016, after a series of events at Nick and [[Carla Connor]]'s ([[Alison King]]) wedding lead to [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) and [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) crashing into Gail's annexe. Callum's decomposed body is discovered and the Platts are all interviewed by the police. Sarah cannot control her emotions. She tells Jason's brother [[Todd Grimshaw]] ([[Bruno Langley]]) that she is responsible for Callum's death, and, Todd believing that Sarah was confessing to killing him, protecting Sarah and Jason, tells the police that Tony, who has died off-screen, killed Callum. Evil builder [[Pat Phelan (Coronation Street)|Pat Phelan]] (Connor McIntyre) blackmails Jason in order to keep the murder wrench hidden. Jason then caves in and asks Phelan to retrieve the tool bag with wrench in it and he hands it in to the police who then believe Tony was the murderer after his and Callum's DNA is found on it. The Platts are then told of this and begin to think that the memory of Callum will no longer bother them again but Kylie thinks otherwise and convinces David to move to Barbados.\n\n===Tracy blackmails Carla (2016)===\nIn December 2015, [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) whilst in prison begins sending [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley]]) visiting orders, and reveals that Johnny could potentially be [[Carla Connor]]'s ([[Alison King]]) biological father. He does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. This reveals that he is Carla's biological father, and he decides to break the news to her. Carla is furious and slaps Johnny, however Johnny continues to plead with Carla not to tell children [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate]] ([[Faye Brookes]]). Carla heads for a casino where she bumps into [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), [[Tracy Barlow]]'s ([[Kate Ford]]) ex-husband, who had just broken up with her for planning to elope with Rob, and after gambling with him, Carla has sex with him. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who attempts to persuade Carla not to tell fianc\u00e9e [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]). Carla tells Aidan and Kate about Johnny being her dad and they disown him. They and Carla eventually reconcile with him.\n\nIn January 2016, Carla tries to stop Robert from buying into the bistro and they have an argument, with Tracy listening and discovering what happened. Two thugs rob the empty bistro and attack Carla, and when she chases them for her handbag she gets dragged down the street in their car and falls out, landing her in a critical condition. Tracy confronts Carla and blackmails her to move to Devon in turn for not telling Nick about her and Robert. Robert buys the bistro from Nick with Carla's money. Tracy continues to blackmail her.\n\nOn Carla's wedding day, Tracy is threatened by Johnny that she will not ruin her day. She does, first by sending the wedding flowers to the wrong place. Johnny, fearing that Tracy will ruin everything, locks her in a storeroom in Underworld. Carla, feeling guilty, tells Nick about Robert. He forgives her and they continue the wedding. Tracy breaks free and tells Nick about the blackmail, leading Nick to split up with her and to punch Robert, who splits up with Tracy, and [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Rodwell]] ([[Helen Worth]]) slapping Carla.\n\n=== Kylie Platt's death (2016) ===\nIn February 2016, when it was announced that [[Paula Lane]], who played [[Kylie Platt]] since 2010, had quit the soap after five years, ''Coronation Street'' producers also announced that they were working on a \"top secret storyline\" for Kylie's exit. Many fans and viewers thought that Kylie was going to be imprisoned for [[Callum Logan]]'s (Sean Ward) murder, but on 1 July 2016, it was finally revealed that Kylie will be killed off. Lane and [[Jack P. Shepherd]], who has played Kylie's husband [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] since 2000, said that they actually cried after reading the scripts and during Kylie's death scene.\n\nProducers kept details about Kylie's death quiet until the episode aired on 15 July 2016; she was stabbed in the chest by Callum's friend, [[Clayton Hibbs]] (Callum Harrison), during a fight with him in an attempt to protect her friend, [[Gemma Winter]] (Dolly-Rose Campbell). She died in David's arms in the middle of the street just after an ambulance arrived.\n\nKylie's death received a mixed response from viewers and critics alike, many expressed disappointment, calling it an anticlimax, and others criticized her death scene for being too violent.<ref name=\"KylieDeathCriticism\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/tv/coronation-street/571659/coronation-street-did-you-notice-these-6-things-about-kylie-platts-death|title=Did you notice these 6 thiings about Kylie Platt's death?|first=Charlotte|last=Tutton|date=15 July 2016|work=[[OK! Magazine]]}}</ref> The scenes were further criticised for the many discrepancies, including slow ambulance response times, the close proximity of the medical centre, the failure of any characters to administer first-aid, and more.<ref name=\"KylieDeathCriticism\"/> However, Lane and Shepherd's acting was praised, along with the emotional nature of the scenes.\n\n===Car crash and explosion (2016)===\nIn July 2016, it was reported that an explosion would rip through the street later in the year. In August 2016, ''Coronation Street'' actress [[Samia Ghadie]], who plays [[Maria Connor]] in the soap said that another \"well\u2013loved\" character would be killed off in the explosion months after [[Kylie Platt]]'s ([[Paula Lane]]) heartbreaking death and that she had already had a read through of the scripts. The street explosion took place on 21 October 2016 after a week of events after a car crash caused by [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) happened as he was trying to get revenge on Kylie's killer. [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) was trapped under the car but managed to get out before it exploded however his mother [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) was set on fire and badly injured.\n\n==Smaller storylines==\n*On 11 September 1961, [[Ida Barlow]] ([[Noel Dyson]]) was struck by a bus and killed.\n*In 1961, [[Elsie Tanner]] ([[Patricia Phoenix]]) received a poison pen letter during her affair with a married man.\n*In 1967, [[Elsie Tanner]] wed former GI [[Steve Tanner (Coronation Street)|Steve Tanner]] (his surname was almost changed at the last minute; no one would have changed Elsie's, since she was such a popular character) in the Street's first lavish wedding shoot. Steve was played by Canadian actor [[Paul Maxwell]].\n*In 1969, in time to usher in colour television transmissions, the show planned an outing to the Lake District, so that viewers could see the autumn foliage in all its glory. However, there was no colour film available for the episode, leading to the videotaped studio footage being in colour and the filmed exterior footage being in black and white.  So the first full colour episode aired was to be after the core cast members had been involved in a car accident on the way back from the Lake, and were all in hospital.\n*In 1975, a warehouse fire killed [[Edna Gee]] (Mavis Rogerson).\n*In 1980, [[Renee Bradshaw|Renee Roberts]] ([[Madge Hindle]]) was killed off after public opinion polls showed the character (as well as her marriage to [[Alf Roberts]], played by actor [[Bryan Mosley]]) to be very unpopular.

She had had sex with Neil Fearns ([[Paul Holowaty]]), a teenage lad, in late 1999; by the time she went to the doctor (her mother [[Gail Platt|Gail]] ([[Helen Worth]]) had dragged her there due to fears she was suffering from an [[eating disorder]]) and found out she was pregnant, it was too late for an abortion. The storyline won high praise, including from [[Yvette Cooper]], the government health minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/662122.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Street drama wins praise|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref>\n*2001 featured the rape of [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), [[Les Battersby]]'s ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]) teenage stepdaughter, by Phil Simmonds ([[Jack Deam]]).\n*In 2001, [[Alma Halliwell|Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]), the ex-wife of Mike Baldwin, died from cervical cancer.\n*In 2001, Sarah Platt, daughter of fell foul of Gary Adams ([[Samuel Kane]]), an internet stalker whom she met through a chatroom.

Her grief-stricken but practical mother [[Angela Harris (Coronation Street)|Angela Harris]] ([[Kathryn Hunt]]) decided it was best if they denied all knowledge of the murder. When the police arrested Angela on suspicion of the murder of her husband, she believed Katy wouldn't survive in jail so she took the blame, plead guilty in court, and was sentenced to prison. Katy, who is diabetic, felt overwhelmed with the guilt of her parents' fate and committed suicide by drinking a bag of sugar mixed with cola and not taking her insulin. Although her suicide note exonerated Angela of the murder, she was still sentenced to prison for four years for [[perjury]].

In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"soft\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is called \"hard\".\n\nOnce all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n\n* If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"blackjack\" or \"[[natural (gambling)|natural]]\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.\n* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"busts\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.\n* If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"busts\") and the player does not; the player wins.\n* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.\n* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"push\", no one wins.\n\nBlackjack has over 100 rule variations. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high-profile target of [[Advantage gambling|advantage players]], particularly [[card counting|card counters]], who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly. In response, casinos have introduced counter-measures that can increase the difficulty of advantage play.\n\nBlackjack has inspired other casino games, including [[Spanish 21]] and [[Pontoon (card game)|pontoon]].\n\n==History==\nBlackjack's precursor was ''twenty-one'', a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], most famous for writing ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Cervantes was a [[gambler]], and the main characters of his tale \"[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]\", from ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'', are a couple of cheats working in [[Seville]]. They are proficient at cheating at ''veintiuna'' (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the [[ace]] values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish ''[[Spanish playing cards|baraja]]'' deck. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ''ventiuna'' was played in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fontbona | first = Marc | title = Historia del Juego en Espa\u00f1a.

One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the [[ace of spades]] and a black [[jack (playing card)|jack]] (either the [[jack of clubs]] or the [[jack of spades]]). This hand was called a \"blackjack\", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a ''blackjack'' refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colors.<ref name=\"Scarne\" />{{rp|350}}\n\nThe first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956.  Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled ''The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack'' in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.  This paper would become the foundation of future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. [[Ed Thorp]] would use Baldwin's hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book ''Beat the Dealer''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackjack History and Events|url=https://www.blackjackreview.com/wp/historical-events/|publisher=blackjackreview.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rules of play at casinos==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = Blackjack example game\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align =\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Blackjack game 1.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | caption1  = Initial deal\n | image2    = Blackjack game 2.JPG\n | width2    = 250\n | caption2  = Player action\n | image3    = Blackjack game 3.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n | caption3  = Dealer's hand revealed\n | image4    = Blackjack game 4.JPG\n | width4    = 250\n | caption4  = Bets settled\n }}\nAt a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight [[standard 52-card deck]]s are [[shuffling|shuffled]] together. At the beginning of each round, up to three players can place their bets in the \"betting box\" at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to \"play behind\". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.\n\nThe dealer deals cards from their left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as \"first base\") to their far right (\"third base\"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in \"hole card\" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, \"no hole card\" games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.\n\nCards are dealt either from one or two handheld decks, from a [[shoe (cards)|dealer's shoe]], or from a [[shuffling machine]]. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).\n\nThe object of the game from the player's perspective is to win money by creating card totals that are higher than those of the dealer's hand, but do not exceed 21 (\"busting\"/\"breaking\"), or alternatively, by \"standing\" (not taking a card) at any total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players must choose whether to \"hit\" (take a card), \"stand\" (end their turn), \"double\" (double wager, take a single card and finish), \"split\" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or \"surrender\" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as \"face cards\" or \"pictures\") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11, also known as a \"soft 17\", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a \"natural\" or \"blackjack\" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as \"push\" or \"standoff\",  bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for player blackjacks which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet) or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.<ref name=LVSun20031113/>\n\nBlackjack games almost always provide a [[side bet]] called insurance, which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace. Additional side bets, such as \"Dealer Match\" which pays when the player's cards match the dealer's up card, are sometimes available.\n\n===Player decisions===\n{{anchor|doubledown}}\n{{redirect|Doubling Down|the South Park episode|Doubling Down (South Park)}}\nAfter receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: \"hit\", \"stand\", \"double down\", or \"split\". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, \"surrender\".\n* '''Hit:''' Take another card from the dealer.\n: ''Signal'': Scrape cards against table (in handheld games); tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Stand:''' Take no more cards, also known as \"stand pat\", \"stick\", or \"stay\".\n: ''Signal'': Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Double down:''' The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.\n* '''Split''': If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.\n* '''Surrender''' (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to \"surrender\" directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.\n: ''Signal'': The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal.\n\nHand signals are used to assist the \"[[eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]\", a person or [[video camera]] located above the table and sometimes concealed behind [[one-way glass]]. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify [[advantage players]] whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.\nEach hand may normally \"hit\" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in [[counterclockwise]] order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.\n\n===Insurance===\nIf the dealer's up card (the card that is showing) is an ace, you are allowed to make an \u201cinsurance\u201d bet. This is a side bet that the dealer has a ten-value card as the down card, giving the dealer a Blackjack. The dealer will ask for insurance bets from all players before the first player plays. You make this bet by placing chips equal to a maximum of half of your current bet on the \u201cinsurance bar\u201d just above your cards. If the dealer has a ten, the insurance bet pays 2:1. In most casinos, the dealer then peeks at the down card and pays or takes the insurance bet immediately. In other casinos, the payoff waits until the end of the play.\n\nIn face-down games, if you are playing more than one hand, you are allowed to look at all of your hands before deciding. This is the only time that you are allowed to look at the second hand before playing the first hand. Using one hand, look at your hands one at a time.\n\nPlayers with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they will win an amount equal to their main wager. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as \"taking even money\". There is no difference in results between taking even money and insuring a blackjack.\n\nInsurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have a blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly [[correlation|anti-correlated]] with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce [[variance]], they might choose to make this bet.\n\nThe insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a one in three chance of being a ten. Card counting techniques can identify such situations.\n\n==Rule variations and effects on house edge==\n''Note: where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in [[percentage point]]s, not percentage; strictly speaking if, say, an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%, the amount is reduced by ten percent, or by one percentage point.''\n[[File:Double down.JPG|thumb|right|Doubling down. The third card is placed at right angles to signify that the player cannot receive any more cards.]]\nThe rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rules of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table, failing which there is an expectation that casino staff will provide them on request. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/blackjack-rules.htm|title=Blackjack Rules - 113 variations|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\nAs with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a \"house edge\", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. The advantage of the dealer's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games. The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is generally expected to be greater.\n\n*'''Dealer hits soft 17'''\n[[File:Soft17.jpg|thumb|right|A \"soft 17\" in blackjack. An ace and any combination of 6.]]\n:Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated \"H17\" in blackjack literature, with \"S17\" used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an \"H17\" rule with an \"S17\" rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.\n\n*'''Number of decks'''\n:All things being equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten on their first card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.\n\n:Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, in order to preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.\n\n:The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Number of decks !! House advantage\n|-\n| Single deck || 0.17%\n|-\n| Double deck || 0.46%\n|-\n| Four decks || 0.60%\n|-\n| Six decks || 0.64%\n|-\n| Eight decks || 0.65%\n|}\n\n;Late/early surrender:\n\nSurrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as \"late\" surrender. The alternative, \"early\" surrender, gives player the option to surrender ''before'' the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender. Most medium-strength hands should be surrendered against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.\n\nFor late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.\n\n;Resplitting: If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or \"resplit\". The player places a further wager and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, \"resplit to 4\").\n;Hit/resplit split aces: After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) is a \"soft 21\" and not a \"natural\".\n;No double after split: After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.\n;Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only: Under the \"[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] rule\", double down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). Basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13\u201318, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19\u201320 and hard 8, 7 and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double down in these situations and thereby increases the player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around 1 in 1,000, and its European version by around 1 in 500.\n;No hole card and OBO:\n\nIn most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of aces against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game.  The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.\n\nThe \"original bets only\" rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (\"original\") is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. \"Original bets only\" is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/book/ModernBlackjackPage39.htm|title=Modern Blackjack|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\n;Altered payout for a winning blackjack: In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. This is most common at tables with lower [[Table limit|table minimums]]. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout for a blackjack.<ref name=LVSun20031113>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/nov/13/taking-a-hit-new-blackjack-odds-further-tilt-advan/ ''Taking a hit: New blackjack odds further tilt advantage toward the house''] by Jeff Haney, [[Las Vegas Sun]], November 13, 2003.</ref>\n;Dealer wins ties: The rule that bets on tied hands are lost rather than pushed is catastrophic to the player.  Though rarely used in standard blackjack, it is sometimes seen in \"blackjack-like\" games such as in some charity casinos.\n\n==Blackjack strategy==\n\n===Basic strategy===\nEach blackjack game has a ''basic strategy'', which prescribes the optimal method of playing any hand against any dealer up-card so that the long-term [[house advantage]] (the expected loss of the player) is minimized.\n\nAn example of a basic strategy is shown in the table below, which applies to a game with the following specifications:<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\">{{cite web|title=4-Deck to 8-Deck Blackjack Strategy - Wizard of Odds|url=http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/|publisher=Wizard of Odds Consulting, Inc|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> \n* Four to eight decks\n* The dealer hits on a soft 17\n* A double is allowed after a split\n* Only original bets are lost on dealer blackjack\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

For example, to use the table above on a game with the stand on soft 17 rule (which favors the player, and is typically found only at higher-limit tables today) only 6 cells would need to be changed: hit on 11 ''vs.'' A, hit on 15 ''vs.'' A, stand on 17 ''vs.'' A, stand on A,7 ''vs.'' 2, stand on A,8 ''vs.'' 6, and split on 8,8 ''vs.'' A. Regardless of the specific rule variations, taking insurance or \"even money\" is never the correct play under basic strategy.<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\"/>\n\nEstimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size.\n\nMost blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games from the perspective of the player. Casino promotions such as complimentary match play vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.\n\n===Composition-dependent strategy===\nBasic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:<ref name= wizard>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix3c.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Fine points of basic strategy in single-deck blackjack |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}</ref>\n* It makes the player's 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).\n* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.\n\nHowever, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.<ref name= wizard2>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix15.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Total Dependent and Composition Dependent Basic Strategy in Blackjack |accessdate=December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Advantage play===\n{{Main|Advantage player}}\nBlackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or [[blacklist]]ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:\n\n====Card counting====\n{{Main|Card counting}}\n\nDuring the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:\n* Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.\n* Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.\n\nA card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2\u20136, 0 points for 7\u20139 and \u22121 point for 10\u2013A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for \"balanced\" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.\n\nBlackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%\u20131% when players use basic strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingbonuses.com/blackjack.htm#table|title=Blackjack - Beating Bonuses|website=www.beatingbonuses.com}}</ref> Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.<ref name=\"TOB\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Peter |title=The theory of blackjack : the compleat card counter's guide to the casino game of 21 |date=March 1, 1999 |publisher=Huntington Press |isbn=978-0929712130 |edition=6th}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nCard counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly advantageous to the card counting player. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.\n\nCard counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter is not using an external device,<ref name=\"TOB\" />{{rp|6\u20137}} but if a casino realizes a player is counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.<ref>[[Edward O. Thorp|Thorp, Edward O.]] (1966) ''Beat The Dealer'', Vintage Books, a Division of Random House, {{ISBN|978-0-394-70310-7}}, pp 132\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal in all US states that license blackjack card games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|title=State Gambling Laws|website=www.gambling-law-us.com|access-date=October 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007151916/http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|archive-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Shuffle tracking====\n{{main|Shuffle tracking}}\nTechniques other than card counting can swing the advantage of casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by [[Edward O. Thorp]].<ref>Edward Thorp: ''A Favorable Strategy for Twenty-One'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 47, No. 1, 1961, pp. 110\u2013112, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/70615 JSTOR], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC285252/pdf/pnas00217-0125.pdf archive of PNAS].</ref> One technique, mainly applicable in multi-deck games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking2.htm|title=Blackjack in Color|work=Shuffle Tracking Counts}}</ref>\n\nArnold Snyder's articles in ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, ''The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook,'' mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. [[Jerry L. Patterson]] also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.<ref>''The Gambling Times Guide to Blackjack''; Gambling Times Incorporated, Hollywood, CA;  1984; Page 110; {{ISBN|0-89746-015-4}} Shuffle-Tracking An Easy Way to Start</ref><ref>''Break the Dealer''; by Jerry L.

Patterson; Perigee Books; A Division of Penguin Putnam; \u00a9 1990; {{ISBN|0-399-51598-4}}  Shuffle-Tracking; Chapter 4, Page 51</ref>\n\n====Identifying concealed cards====\nThe player can also gain an advantage by identifying cards from distinctive wear markings on their backs, or by [[hole carding]] (observing during the dealing process the front of a card dealt face down). These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.\n\n==Side bets==\nMany blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Odds|work=Blackjack Side Bets|url=http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix8.html}}</ref>\n*Player hand and dealer's up card sum to 19, 20, or 21 (\"Lucky Lucky\")\n*Player initial hand is a pair (\"Perfect pairs\")\n*Player initial hand is suited, suited and connected, or a suited K-Q (\"Royal match\")\n*Player initial hand plus dealer's card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind [[three card poker|poker]] hand (\"21+3\")\n*Player initial hand totals 20 (\"Lucky Ladies\")\n*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the players two cards (\"In Bet\")\n*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust  (\"Bust It!\")\n*One or both of the players cards is the same as the dealers card (\"Match the Dealer\")\n\nThe side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.\n\nThe house edge for side bets is generally far higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count, designed specifically for a particular side bet, can improve the player edge. Only a few side bets, like \"Lucky Ladies\", offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play.\n\nIn team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.\n\n==Blackjack tournaments==\nBlackjack can be played in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; the goal is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, [[Elimination Blackjack]], drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.\n\n==Video blackjack==\n[[Image:Video Blackjack Machine at Seven Feathers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A video Blackjack machine at [[Seven Feathers Casino Resort|Seven Feathers Casino]].]]\nSome casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games generally deal each round from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting ineffective in most situations.\n\n==Variants of the game==\nBlackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.\n\n*'''[[Spanish 21]]''' provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to ''rescue'', or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6\u20137\u20138 21s, 7\u20137\u20137 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name [[Pontoon (card game)|\"Pontoon\"]] (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game \"Pontoon\" which has substantially different rules).\n*'''21st-Century Blackjack''' (also known as \"Vegas Style\" Blackjack) is found in California card rooms. In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the player can still push if the dealer busts as well, although the dealer typically has to bust with a higher total.\n*'''[[Double Exposure Blackjack]]''' deals the first two cards of the dealer's hand face up. Blackjacks pay [[even money]], and players lose on ties; also, they can neither buy insurance nor can they surrender their hand (as both dealer's cards are exposed at the outset).\n*'''[[Double Attack Blackjack]]''' has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.\n*'''[[Blackjack Switch]]''' is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10\u20136 and 5\u201310, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10\u201310 and 6\u20135.  Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.\n*'''[[Super Fun 21]]''' allows a player to split a hand up to four times. If the player has six cards totaling 20, he automatically wins. Wins are paid 1:1.\n\nExamples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include '''French/German Blackjack''', called ''Vingt-et-un'' (French: Twenty-one) or \"Siebzehn und Vier\" (German: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called \"Pontoon\", the name being probably a corruption of \"Vingt-et-un\".\n\n===TV show variations===\nBlackjack is also featured in various television shows. Here are a few shows inspired by the game.\n\n*'''''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]''''' was a game show with [[Wink Martindale]] where couples answer questions to collect cards that could add up to 21.\n*'''''[[Catch 21]]''''' is a [[Game Show Network|GSN]] game show with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] from ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. On this show, three players answer questions to earn cards in order to win cash and ties are not allowed.\n*From 1980 to 2006, there was a blackjack-based [[List of The Price is Right pricing games|pricing game]] on ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', called '''Hit Me'''. In this game, six grocery products were used, and five of those products' prices were multiplied by various numbers from 2 to 10, but with the one remaining product having the exact price. In order to win a large prize, the contestant had to achieve a score of 21 (which was usually done by picking a product whose price was multiplied by ten and the one that was correctly priced), or beat the house with any score that did not exceed 21.\n\n==Blackjack Hall of Fame==\n{{Main|Blackjack Hall of Fame}}\n\nIn 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the [[Blackjack Hall of Fame]]. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the [[Barona Casino]] in [[San Diego]]. Members include [[Edward O. Thorp]], author of the 1960s book ''Beat the Dealer'' which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and [[card counting]]; [[Ken Uston]], who popularized the concept of team play; [[Arnold Snyder]], author and editor of the ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' trade journal; [[Stanford Wong]], author and popularizer of the \"Wonging\" technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.\n\n== Blackjack in the arts ==\nNovels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these were ''The Blackjack Hijack'' (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie [[Nowhere to Run (1978 film)|''Nowhere to Run'']], and [[Bringing Down the House (book)|''Bringing Down the House'']] (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as [[21 (2008 film)|''21'']]. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film ''[[The Last Casino]]''.\n\nIn ''The Hangover'', an American comedy, four friends try to count cards to win back enough money to secure the release of their friend from the clutches of a notorious criminal they stole from the previous night while blacked out. A central part of the plot of ''[[Rain Man]]'' is that Raymond ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an autistic [[savant syndrome|savant]], is able to win at blackjack by counting cards. In the 2014 film ''[[The Gambler (2014 film)|The Gambler]]'' we see Jim Bennett ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) playing high stakes Blackjack in order to win large sums of money. This movie displays different blackjack lingo and risky moves that have high rewards.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Gambler (film series)]]\n* [[Glossary of blackjack terms]]\n* [[MIT Blackjack Team]]\n\n==Blackjack literature==\n* ''Beat the Dealer : A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One'', [[Edward O.

''A History of Card Games'', OUP, Oxford, p. 78. {{ISBN|0-19-282905-X}}</ref> It is a comparing [[card game]] between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more [[Playing card|decks]] of 52 cards, and is the most widely played [[casino game|casino]] banking game in the world.<ref name=\"Scarne\">{{cite book |last1=Scarne |first1=John |title=Scarne's new complete guide to gambling |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0671630638 |edition=Fully rev., expanded , updated|year=1986 }}</ref>{{rp|342}} \n\nPlayers are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"soft\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is called \"hard\".\n\nOnce all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay. (At most tables the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.) You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n\n* If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"blackjack\" or \"[[natural (gambling)|natural]]\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.\n* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"busts\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.\n* If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"busts\") and the player does not; the player wins.\n* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.\n* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"push\", no one wins.\n\nBlackjack has over 100 rule variations. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high-profile target of [[Advantage gambling|advantage players]], particularly [[card counting|card counters]], who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wagers and playing strategies accordingly. In response, casinos have introduced counter-measures that can increase the difficulty of advantage play.\n\nBlackjack has inspired other casino games, including [[Spanish 21]] and [[Pontoon (card game)|pontoon]].\n\n==History==\nBlackjack's precursor was ''twenty-one'', a game of unknown origin. The first written reference is found in a book by the Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], most famous for writing ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Cervantes was a [[gambler]], and the main characters of his tale \"[[Rinconete y Cortadillo]]\", from ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'', are a couple of cheats working in [[Seville]]. They are proficient at cheating at ''veintiuna'' (Spanish for twenty-one), and state that the object of the game is to reach 21 points without going over and that the [[ace]] values 1 or 11. The game is played with the Spanish ''[[Spanish playing cards|baraja]]'' deck. This short story was written between 1601 and 1602, implying that ''ventiuna'' was played in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] since the beginning of the 17th century or earlier. Later references to this game are found in France and Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Fontbona | first = Marc | title = Historia del Juego en Espa\u00f1a.

One such bonus was a ten-to-one payout if the player's hand consisted of the [[ace of spades]] and a black [[jack (playing card)|jack]] (either the [[jack of clubs]] or the [[jack of spades]]). This hand was called a \"blackjack\", and the name stuck to the game even though the ten-to-one bonus was soon withdrawn. In the modern game, a ''blackjack'' refers to any hand of an ace plus a ten or face card regardless of suits or colors.<ref name=\"Scarne\" />{{rp|350}}\n\nThe first scientific and mathematically sound attempt to devise an optimal blackjack playing strategy was revealed in September 1956.  Roger Baldwin, Wilbert Cantey, Herbert Maisel and James McDermott published a paper titled ''The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack'' in the Journal of the American Statistical Association.  This paper would become the foundation of future sound efforts to beat the game of blackjack. [[Ed Thorp]] would use Baldwin's hand calculations to verify the basic strategy and later publish (in 1963) his famous book ''Beat the Dealer''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blackjack History and Events|url=https://www.blackjackreview.com/wp/historical-events/|publisher=blackjackreview.com|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rules of play at casinos==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = Blackjack example game\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align =\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Blackjack game 1.JPG\n | width1    = 250\n | caption1  = Initial deal\n | image2    = Blackjack game 2.JPG\n | width2    = 250\n | caption2  = Player action\n | image3    = Blackjack game 3.JPG\n | width3    = 250\n | caption3  = Dealer's hand revealed\n | image4    = Blackjack game 4.JPG\n | width4    = 250\n | caption4  = Bets settled\n }}\nAt a casino blackjack table, the dealer faces five to seven playing positions from behind a semicircular table. Between one and eight [[standard 52-card deck]]s are [[shuffling|shuffled]] together. At the beginning of each round, up to three players can place their bets in the \"betting box\" at each position in play. That is, there could be up to three players at each position at a table in jurisdictions that allow back betting. The player whose bet is at the front of the betting box is deemed to have control over the position, and the dealer will consult the controlling player for playing decisions regarding the hand; the other players of that box are said to \"play behind\". Any player is usually allowed to control or bet in as many boxes as desired at a single table, but it is prohibited for an individual to play on more than one table at a time or to place multiple bets within a single box. In many U.S. casinos, however, players are limited to playing two or three positions at a table and often only one person is allowed to bet on each position.\n\nThe dealer deals cards from their left (the position on the dealer's far left is often referred to as \"first base\") to their far right (\"third base\"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first card face up, and in \"hole card\" games immediately receives its second card face down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, \"no hole card\" games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.\n\nCards are dealt either from one or two handheld decks, from a [[shoe (cards)|dealer's shoe]], or from a [[shuffling machine]]. Single cards are dealt to each wagered-on position clockwise from the dealer's left, followed by a single card to the dealer, followed by an additional card to each of the positions in play. The players' initial cards may be dealt face up or face down (more common in single-deck games).\n\nThe object of the game from the player's perspective is to win money by creating card totals that are higher than those of the dealer's hand, but do not exceed 21 (\"busting\"/\"breaking\"), or alternatively, by \"standing\" (not taking a card) at any total in the hope that dealer will bust. On their turn, players must choose whether to \"hit\" (take a card), \"stand\" (end their turn), \"double\" (double wager, take a single card and finish), \"split\" (if the two cards have the same value, separate them to make two hands) or \"surrender\" (give up a half-bet and retire from the game). Number cards count as their natural value; the jack, queen, and king (also known as \"face cards\" or \"pictures\") count as 10; aces are valued as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the hand value exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it are immediately forfeit. After all boxes have finished playing, the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher (a dealer total of 17 including an ace valued as 11, also known as a \"soft 17\", must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). The dealer never doubles, splits, or surrenders. If the dealer busts, all remaining player hands win. If the dealer does not bust, each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer's, and loses if it is lower. If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a \"natural\" or \"blackjack\" and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural, in which case the hand ties. In the case of a tied score, known as \"push\" or \"standoff\",  bets are normally returned without adjustment; however, a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack, even one with a value of 21. Wins are paid out at 1:1, or equal to the wager, except for player blackjacks which are traditionally paid at 3:2 (meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet) or one-and-a-half times the wager. Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3:2 at some tables; for instance, single-deck blackjack tables often pay 6:5 for a blackjack instead of 3:2.<ref name=LVSun20031113/>\n\nBlackjack games almost always provide a [[side bet]] called insurance, which may be played when dealer's upcard is an ace. Additional side bets, such as \"Dealer Match\" which pays when the player's cards match the dealer's up card, are sometimes available.\n\n===Player decisions===\n{{anchor|doubledown}}\n{{redirect|Doubling Down|the South Park episode|Doubling Down (South Park)}}\nAfter receiving an initial two cards, the player has up to four standard options: \"hit\", \"stand\", \"double down\", or \"split\". Each option has a corresponding hand signal. Some games give the player a fifth option, \"surrender\".\n* '''Hit:''' Take another card from the dealer.\n: ''Signal'': Scrape cards against table (in handheld games); tap the table with finger or wave hand toward body (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Stand:''' Take no more cards, also known as \"stand pat\", \"stick\", or \"stay\".\n: ''Signal'': Slide cards under chips (in handheld games); wave hand horizontally (in games dealt face up).\n* '''Double down:''' The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving exactly one more card. The additional bet is placed in the betting box next to the original bet. Some games do not permit the player to increase the bet by amounts other than 100%. Non-controlling players may double their wager or decline to do so, but they are bound by the controlling player's decision to take only one card.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips beside the original bet outside the betting box, and point with one finger.\n* '''Split''': If the first two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer separates the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; except for a few restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, but not one of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.\n: ''Signal'': Place additional chips next to the original bet outside the betting box; point with two fingers spread into a V formation.\n* '''Surrender''' (only available as first decision of a hand): Some games offer the option to \"surrender\" directly after the dealer has checked for blackjack (see below for variations). When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player; this terminates the player's interest in the hand.\n: ''Signal'': The request to surrender is made verbally, there being no standard hand signal.\n\nHand signals are used to assist the \"[[eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]\", a person or [[video camera]] located above the table and sometimes concealed behind [[one-way glass]]. The eye in the sky usually makes a video recording of the table, which helps in resolving disputes and identifying dealer mistakes, and is also used to protect the casino against dealers who steal chips or players who cheat. The recording can further be used to identify [[advantage players]] whose activities, while legal, make them undesirable customers. In the event of a disagreement between a player's hand signals and their words, the hand signal takes precedence.\nEach hand may normally \"hit\" as many times as desired so long as the total is not above hard 20. On reaching 21 (including soft 21), the hand is normally required to stand; busting is an irrevocable loss and the players' wagers are immediately forfeited to the house. After a bust or a stand, play proceeds to the next hand clockwise around the table. When the last hand has finished being played, the dealer reveals the hole card, and stands or draws further cards according to the rules of the game for dealer drawing. When the outcome of the dealer's hand is established, any hands with bets remaining on the table are resolved (usually in [[counterclockwise]] order): bets on losing hands are forfeited, the bet on a push is left on the table, and winners are paid out.\n\n===Insurance===\nIf the dealer's up card (the card that is showing) is an ace, you are allowed to make an \u201cinsurance\u201d bet. This is a side bet that the dealer has a ten-value card as the down card, giving the dealer a Blackjack. The dealer will ask for insurance bets from all players before the first player plays. You make this bet by placing chips equal to a maximum of half of your current bet on the \u201cinsurance bar\u201d just above your cards. If the dealer has a ten, the insurance bet pays 2:1. In most casinos, the dealer then peeks at the down card and pays or takes the insurance bet immediately. In other casinos, the payoff waits until the end of the play.\n\nIn face-down games, if you are playing more than one hand, you are allowed to look at all hands before deciding. This is the only time that you are allowed to look at the second hand before playing the first hand. Using one hand, look at the hands one at a time.\n\nPlayers with a blackjack may also take insurance, and in taking maximum insurance they will win an amount equal to their main wager, regardless of the dealer's outcome. Fully insuring a blackjack against blackjack is thus referred to as \"taking even money\". There is no difference in results between taking even money and insuring a blackjack.\n\nInsurance bets are expected to lose money in the long run, because the dealer is likely to have a blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly [[correlation|anti-correlated]] with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce [[variance]], they might choose to make this bet.\n\nThe insurance bet is susceptible to advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card has more than a one in three chance of being a ten. Card counting techniques can identify such situations.\n\n==Rule variations and effects on house edge==\n''Note: where changes in the house edge due to changes in the rules are stated in percentage terms, the difference is usually stated here in [[percentage point]]s, not percentage; strictly speaking if, say, an edge of 10% is reduced to 9%, the amount is reduced by ten percent, or by one percentage point.''\n[[File:Double down.JPG|thumb|right|Doubling down. The third card is placed at right angles to signify that the player cannot receive any more cards.]]\nThe rules of casino blackjack are generally determined by law or regulation, which establishes certain rule variations allowed at the discretion of the casino. The rules of any particular game are generally posted on or near the table, failing which there is an expectation that casino staff will provide them on request. Over 100 variations of blackjack have been documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/blackjack-rules.htm|title=Blackjack Rules - 113 variations|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\nAs with all casino games, blackjack incorporates a \"house edge\", a statistical advantage for the casino that is built into the game. The advantage of the dealer's position in blackjack relative to the player comes from the fact that if the player busts, the player loses, regardless of whether the dealer subsequently busts. Nonetheless, blackjack players using basic strategy will lose less than 1% of their total wagered amount with strictly average luck; this is very favorable to the player compared to other casino games. The loss rate of players who deviate from basic strategy through ignorance is generally expected to be greater.\n\n*'''Dealer hits soft 17'''\n[[File:Soft17.jpg|thumb|right|A \"soft 17\" in blackjack. An ace and any combination of 6.]]\n:Each game has a rule about whether the dealer must hit or stand on soft 17, which is generally printed on the table surface. The variation where the dealer must hit soft 17 is abbreviated \"H17\" in blackjack literature, with \"S17\" used for the stand-on-soft-17 variation. Substituting an \"H17\" rule with an \"S17\" rule in a game benefits the player, decreasing the house edge by about 0.2%.\n\n*'''Number of decks'''\n:All things being equal, using fewer decks decreases the house edge. This mainly reflects an increased likelihood of player blackjack, since if the players draws a ten on their first card, the subsequent probability of drawing an ace is higher with fewer decks. It also reflects a decreased likelihood of blackjack-blackjack push in a game with fewer decks.\n\n:Casinos generally compensate by tightening other rules in games with fewer decks, in order to preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering single deck blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.\n\n:The following table illustrates the mathematical effect on the house edge of the number of decks, by considering games with various deck counts under the following ruleset: double after split allowed, resplit to four hands allowed, no hitting split aces, no surrender, double on any two cards, original bets only lost on dealer blackjack, dealer hits soft 17, and cut-card used. The increase in house edge per unit increase in the number of decks is most dramatic when comparing the single deck game to the two-deck game, and becomes progressively smaller as more decks are added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Number of decks !! House advantage\n|-\n| Single deck || 0.17%\n|-\n| Double deck || 0.46%\n|-\n| Four decks || 0.60%\n|-\n| Six decks || 0.64%\n|-\n| Eight decks || 0.65%\n|}\n\n;Late/early surrender:\n\nSurrender, for those games that allow it, is usually not permitted against a dealer blackjack; if the dealer's first card is an ace or ten, the hole card is checked to make sure there is no blackjack before surrender is offered. This rule protocol is consequently known as \"late\" surrender. The alternative, \"early\" surrender, gives player the option to surrender ''before'' the dealer checks for blackjack, or in a no-hole-card game. Early surrender is much more favorable to the player than late surrender. Most medium-strength hands should be surrendered against a dealer Ace if the hole card has not been checked.\n\nFor late surrender, however, while it is tempting to opt for surrender on any hand which will probably lose, the correct strategy is to only surrender on the very worst hands, because having even a one in four chance of winning the full bet is better than losing half the bet and pushing the other half, as entailed by surrendering.\n\n;Resplitting: If the cards of a post-split hand have the same value, most games allow the player to split again, or \"resplit\". The player places a further wager and the dealer separates the new pair dealing a further card to each as before. Some games allow unlimited resplitting, while others may limit it to a certain number of hands, such as four hands (for example, \"resplit to 4\").\n;Hit/resplit split aces: After splitting aces, the common rule is that only one card will be dealt to each ace; the player cannot split, double, or take another hit on either hand. Rule variants include allowing resplitting aces or allowing the player to hit split aces. Games allowing aces to be resplit are not uncommon, but those allowing the player to hit split aces are extremely rare. Allowing the player to hit hands resulting from split aces reduces the house edge by about 0.13%; allowing resplitting of aces reduces house edge by about 0.03%. Note that a ten-value card dealt on a split ace (or vice versa) is a \"soft 21\" and not a \"natural\".\n;No double after split: After a split, most games allow doubling down on the new two-card hands. Disallowing doubling after a split increases the house edge by about 0.12%.\n;Double on 9/10/11 or 10/11 only: Under the \"[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] rule\", double down is only permitted on hard totals of 9, 10, or 11 (under a similar European rule, only 10 or 11). Basic strategy would otherwise call for some doubling down with hard 9 and soft 13\u201318, and advanced players can identify situations where doubling on soft 19\u201320 and hard 8, 7 and even 6 is advantageous. The Reno rule prevents the player from taking advantage of double down in these situations and thereby increases the player's expected loss. The Reno rule increases the house edge by around 1 in 1,000, and its European version by around 1 in 500.\n;No hole card and OBO:\n\nIn most non-U.S. casinos, a 'no hole card' game is played, meaning that the dealer does not draw nor consult his or her second card until after all players have finished making decisions. With no hole card, it is almost never correct basic strategy to double or split against a dealer ten or ace, since a dealer blackjack will result in the loss of the split and double bets; the only exception is with a pair of aces against a dealer 10, where it is still correct to split. In all other cases, a stand, hit or surrender is called for. For instance, holding 11 against a dealer 10, the correct strategy is to double in a hole card game (where the player knows the dealer's second card is not an ace), but to hit in a no hole card game.  The no hole card rule adds approximately 0.11% to the house edge.\n\nThe \"original bets only\" rule variation appearing in certain no hole card games states that if the player's hand loses to a dealer blackjack, only the mandatory initial bet (\"original\") is forfeited, and all optional bets, meaning doubles and splits, are pushed. \"Original bets only\" is also known by the acronym OBO; it has the same effect on basic strategy and house edge as reverting to a hole card game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfit.com/book/ModernBlackjackPage39.htm|title=Modern Blackjack|website=www.qfit.com}}</ref>\n\n;Altered payout for a winning blackjack: In many casinos, a blackjack pays only 6:5 or even 1:1 instead of the usual 3:2. This is most common at tables with lower [[Table limit|table minimums]]. Although this payoff was originally limited to single-deck games, it has spread to double-deck and shoe games. Among common rule variations in the U.S., these altered payouts for blackjack are the most damaging to the player, causing the greatest increase in house edge. Since blackjack occurs in approximately 4.8% of hands, the 1:1 game increases the house edge by 2.3%, while the 6:5 game adds 1.4% to the house edge. Video blackjack machines generally pay 1:1 payout for a blackjack.<ref name=LVSun20031113>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/nov/13/taking-a-hit-new-blackjack-odds-further-tilt-advan/ ''Taking a hit: New blackjack odds further tilt advantage toward the house''] by Jeff Haney, [[Las Vegas Sun]], November 13, 2003.</ref>\n;Dealer wins ties: The rule that bets on tied hands are lost rather than pushed is catastrophic to the player.

For example, to use the table above on a game with the stand on soft 17 rule (which favors the player, and is typically found only at higher-limit tables today) only 6 cells would need to be changed: hit on 11 ''vs.'' A, hit on 15 ''vs.'' A, stand on 17 ''vs.'' A, stand on A,7 ''vs.'' 2, stand on A,8 ''vs.'' 6, and split on 8,8 ''vs.'' A. Regardless of the specific rule variations, taking insurance or \"even money\" is never the correct play under basic strategy.<ref name=\"wizardofodds.com\"/>\n\nEstimates of the house edge for blackjack games quoted by casinos and gaming regulators are generally based on the assumption that the players follow basic strategy and do not systematically change their bet size.\n\nMost blackjack games have a house edge of between 0.5% and 1%, placing blackjack among the cheapest casino table games from the perspective of the player. Casino promotions such as complimentary match play vouchers or 2:1 blackjack payouts allow the player to acquire an advantage without deviating from basic strategy.\n\n===Composition-dependent strategy===\nBasic strategy is based upon a player's point total and the dealer's visible card. Players may be able to improve on this decision by considering the precise composition of their hand, not just the point total. For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. However, in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2. The presence of a 10 in the player's hand has two consequences:<ref name= wizard>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix3c.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Fine points of basic strategy in single-deck blackjack |accessdate=December 8, 2006}}</ref>\n* It makes the player's 12 a worse hand to stand on (since the only way to avoid losing is for the dealer to go bust, which is less likely if there are fewer 10s left in the shoe).\n* It makes hitting safer, since the only way of going bust is to draw a 10, and this is less likely with a 10 already in the hand.\n\nHowever, even when basic and composition-dependent strategy lead to different actions, the difference in expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.<ref name= wizard2>{{cite web | url= http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix15.html | title= The Wizard of Odds | work=  Total Dependent and Composition Dependent Basic Strategy in Blackjack |accessdate=December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Advantage play===\n{{Main|Advantage player}}\nBlackjack has been a high-profile target for advantage players since the 1960s. Advantage play is the attempt to win more using skills such as memory, computation, and observation. These techniques, while generally legal, can be powerful enough to give the player a long-term edge in the game, making them an undesirable customer for the casino and potentially leading to ejection or [[blacklist]]ing if they are detected. The main techniques of advantage play in blackjack are as follows:\n\n====Card counting====\n{{Main|Card counting}}\n\nDuring the course of a blackjack shoe, the dealer exposes the dealt cards. Careful accounting of the exposed cards allows a player to make inferences about the cards which remain to be dealt. These inferences can be used in the following ways:\n* Players can make larger bets when they have an advantage. For example, the players can increase the starting bet if there are many aces and tens left in the deck, in the hope of hitting a blackjack.\n* Players can deviate from basic strategy according to the composition of their undealt cards. For example, with many tens left in the deck, players might double down in more situations since there is a better chance of getting a good hand.\n\nA card counting system assigns a point score to each rank of card (e.g., 1 point for 2\u20136, 0 points for 7\u20139 and \u22121 point for 10\u2013A). When a card is exposed, a counter adds the score of that card to a running total, the 'count'. A card counter uses this count to make betting and playing decisions according to a table which they have learned. The count starts at 0 for a freshly shuffled deck for \"balanced\" counting systems. Unbalanced counts are often started at a value which depends on the number of decks used in the game.\n\nBlackjack's house edge is usually between 0.5%\u20131% when players use basic strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingbonuses.com/blackjack.htm#table|title=Blackjack - Beating Bonuses|website=www.beatingbonuses.com}}</ref> Card counting can give the player an edge of up to 2% over the house.<ref name=\"TOB\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=Peter |title=The theory of blackjack : the compleat card counter's guide to the casino game of 21 |date=March 1, 1999 |publisher=Huntington Press |isbn=978-0929712130 |edition=6th}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nCard counting is most rewarding near the end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly advantageous to the card counting player. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.\n\nCard counting is legal and is not considered cheating as long as the counter is not using an external device,<ref name=\"TOB\" />{{rp|6\u20137}} but if a casino realizes a player is counting, the casino might inform them that they are no longer welcome to play blackjack. Sometimes a casino might ban a card counter from the property.<ref>[[Edward O. Thorp|Thorp, Edward O.]] (1966) ''Beat The Dealer'', Vintage Books, a Division of Random House, {{ISBN|978-0-394-70310-7}}, pp 132\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe use of external devices to help counting cards is illegal in all US states that license blackjack card games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|title=State Gambling Laws|website=www.gambling-law-us.com|access-date=October 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007151916/http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/|archive-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Shuffle tracking====\n{{main|Shuffle tracking}}\nTechniques other than card counting can swing the advantage of casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques are based on the value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by [[Edward O.

Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackjackincolor.com/Shuffletracking2.htm|title=Blackjack in Color|work=Shuffle Tracking Counts}}</ref>\n\nArnold Snyder's articles in ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' magazine brought shuffle tracking to the general public. His book, ''The Shuffle Tracker's Cookbook,'' mathematically analyzed the player edge available from shuffle tracking based on the actual size of the tracked slug. [[Jerry L. Patterson]] also developed and published a shuffle-tracking method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play.<ref>''The Gambling Times Guide to Blackjack''; Gambling Times Incorporated, Hollywood, CA;  1984; Page 110; {{ISBN|0-89746-015-4}} Shuffle-Tracking An Easy Way to Start</ref><ref>''Break the Dealer''; by Jerry L.

These methods are generally legal although their status in particular jurisdictions may vary.\n\n==Side bets==\nMany blackjack tables offer a side bet on various outcomes including:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wizard of Odds|work=Blackjack Side Bets|url=http://wizardofodds.com/blackjack/appendix8.html}}</ref>\n*Player hand and dealer's up card sum to 19, 20, or 21 (\"Lucky Lucky\")\n*Player initial hand is a pair (\"Perfect pairs\")\n*Player initial hand is suited, suited and connected, or a suited K-Q (\"Royal match\")\n*Player initial hand plus dealer's card makes a flush, straight, or three-of-a-kind [[three card poker|poker]] hand (\"21+3\")\n*Player initial hand totals 20 (\"Lucky Ladies\")\n*Dealer upcard is in between the value of the players two cards (\"In Bet\")\n*First card drawn to the dealer will result in a dealer bust  (\"Bust It!\")\n*One or both of the players cards is the same as the dealers card (\"Match the Dealer\")\n\nThe side wager is typically placed in a designated area next to the box for the main wager. A player wishing to wager on a side bet is usually required to place a wager on blackjack. Some games require that the blackjack wager should equal or exceed any side bet wager. A non-controlling player of a blackjack hand is usually permitted to place a side bet regardless of whether the controlling player does so.\n\nThe house edge for side bets is generally far higher than for the blackjack game itself. Nonetheless side bets can be susceptible to card counting. A side count, designed specifically for a particular side bet, can improve the player edge. Only a few side bets, like \"Lucky Ladies\", offer a sufficient win rate to justify the effort of advantage play.\n\nIn team play it is common for team members to be dedicated toward counting only a sidebet using a specialized count.\n\n==Blackjack tournaments==\nBlackjack can be played in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; the goal is to finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players qualifying from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, [[Elimination Blackjack]], drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an initial entry fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.\n\n==Video blackjack==\n[[Image:Video Blackjack Machine at Seven Feathers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A video Blackjack machine at [[Seven Feathers Casino Resort|Seven Feathers Casino]].]]\nSome casinos, as well as general betting outlets, provide blackjack among a selection of casino-style games at electronic consoles. Video blackjack game rules are generally more favorable to the house; e.g., paying out only even money for winning blackjacks. Video and online blackjack games generally deal each round from a fresh shoe, rendering card counting ineffective in most situations.\n\n==Variants of the game==\nBlackjack is a member of a large family of traditional card games played recreationally all around the world. Most of these games have not been adapted for casino play. Furthermore, the casino game development industry is very active in producing blackjack variants, most of which are ultimately not adopted for widespread use in casinos. The following are the prominent twenty-one themed comparing card games which have been adapted or invented for use in casinos and have become established in the gambling industry.\n\n*'''[[Spanish 21]]''' provides players with many liberal blackjack rules, such as doubling down any number of cards (with the option to ''rescue'', or surrender only one wager to the house), payout bonuses for five or more card 21s, 6\u20137\u20138 21s, 7\u20137\u20137 21s, late surrender, and player blackjacks always winning and player 21s always winning, at the cost of having no 10 cards in the deck (though there are jacks, queens, and kings). An unlicensed version of Spanish 21 played without a hole card is found in Australian casinos under the name [[Pontoon (card game)|\"Pontoon\"]] (presumably borrowed from the British recreational blackjack-like game \"Pontoon\" which has substantially different rules).\n*'''21st-Century Blackjack''' (also known as \"Vegas Style\" Blackjack) is found in California card rooms. In this form of the game, a player bust does not always result in an automatic loss; depending on the casino, the player can still push if the dealer busts as well, although the dealer typically has to bust with a higher total.\n*'''[[Double Exposure Blackjack]]''' deals the first two cards of the dealer's hand face up. Blackjacks pay [[even money]], and players lose on ties; also, they can neither buy insurance nor can they surrender their hand (as both dealer's cards are exposed at the outset).\n*'''[[Double Attack Blackjack]]''' has very liberal blackjack rules and the option of increasing one's wager after seeing the dealer's up card. This game is dealt from a Spanish shoe, and blackjacks only pay even money.\n*'''[[Blackjack Switch]]''' is played over two hands whose second cards the player is allowed to interchange. For example, if the player is dealt 10\u20136 and 5\u201310, then the player can switch two cards to make hands of 10\u201310 and 6\u20135.  Natural blackjacks are paid 1:1 instead of the standard 3:2, and a dealer 22 is a push.\n*'''[[Super Fun 21]]''' allows a player to split a hand up to four times. If the player has six cards totaling 20, he automatically wins. Wins are paid 1:1.\n\nExamples of the many local traditional and recreational blackjack-like games include '''French/German Blackjack''', called ''Vingt-et-un'' (French: Twenty-one) or \"Siebzehn und Vier\" (German: Seventeen and Four). The French/German game does not allow splitting. An ace can only count as eleven, but two aces count as a blackjack. It is mostly played in private circles and barracks. A British variation is called \"Pontoon\", the name being probably a corruption of \"Vingt-et-un\".\n\n===TV show variations===\nBlackjack is also featured in various television shows. Here are a few shows inspired by the game.\n\n*'''''[[Gambit (game show)|Gambit]]''''' was a game show with [[Wink Martindale]] where couples answer questions to collect cards that could add up to 21.\n*'''''[[Catch 21]]''''' is a [[Game Show Network|GSN]] game show with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] from ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. On this show, three players answer questions to earn cards in order to win cash and ties are not allowed.\n*From 1980 to 2006, there was a blackjack-based [[List of The Price is Right pricing games|pricing game]] on ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', called '''Hit Me'''. In this game, six grocery products were used, and five of those products' prices were multiplied by various numbers from 2 to 10, but with the one remaining product having the exact price. In order to win a large prize, the contestant had to achieve a score of 21 (which was usually done by picking a product whose price was multiplied by ten and the one that was correctly priced), or beat the house with any score that did not exceed 21.\n\n==Blackjack Hall of Fame==\n{{Main|Blackjack Hall of Fame}}\n\nIn 2002, professional gamblers around the world were invited to nominate great blackjack players for admission into the [[Blackjack Hall of Fame]]. Seven members were inducted in 2002, with new people inducted every year after. The Hall of Fame is at the [[Barona Casino]] in [[San Diego]]. Members include [[Edward O. Thorp]], author of the 1960s book ''Beat the Dealer'' which proved that the game could be beaten with a combination of basic strategy and [[card counting]]; [[Ken Uston]], who popularized the concept of team play; [[Arnold Snyder]], author and editor of the ''[[Blackjack Forum]]'' trade journal; [[Stanford Wong]], author and popularizer of the \"Wonging\" technique of only playing at a positive count, and several others.\n\n== Blackjack in the arts ==\nNovels have been written around blackjack and the possibility of winning games via some kind of method. Among these were ''The Blackjack Hijack'' (Charles Einstein, 1976), later produced as the TV movie [[Nowhere to Run (1978 film)|''Nowhere to Run'']], and [[Bringing Down the House (book)|''Bringing Down the House'']] (Ben Mezrich), also filmed as [[21 (2008 film)|''21'']]. An almost identical theme was shown in the 2004 Canadian film ''[[The Last Casino]]''.\n\nIn ''The Hangover'', an American comedy, four friends try to count cards to win back enough money to secure the release of their friend from the clutches of a notorious criminal they stole from the previous night while blacked out. A central part of the plot of ''[[Rain Man]]'' is that Raymond ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an autistic [[savant syndrome|savant]], is able to win at blackjack by counting cards. In the 2014 film ''[[The Gambler (2014 film)|The Gambler]]'' we see Jim Bennett ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) playing high stakes Blackjack in order to win large sums of money. This movie displays different blackjack lingo and risky moves that have high rewards.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Gambler (film series)]]\n* [[Glossary of blackjack terms]]\n* [[MIT Blackjack Team]]\n\n==Blackjack literature==\n* ''Beat the Dealer : A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One'', [[Edward O.

The ENSTA Bretagne is a higher education establishment and a research centre run under the supervision of the [[French ministry of defense|French ministry of Armed Forces]]  which governs a total of 4 engineering schools: \u00c9cole Polytechnique, ENSTA ParisTech, ENSTA Bretagne and ISAE-Supaero.\n\nEvery year, it trains approximately 180 general engineers and generally recruits its students through the Concours Commun Mines Ponts competitive entrance exams. ENSTA Bretagne is partly a [[military academy]] for engineers because it trains engineers for the armed forces, although nowadays the majority (80%) of trainees are civilians. The ENSTA Bretagne is located in [[Brest, France]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== History ===\nCreated in 1819, the Maistrance (petty officer) schools were reorganized over the years into two levels of training. The schools of higher education, situated in Brest and Toulon took the name of \u201cEcoles Normales de Maistrance\u201d in 1868. When the school in Toulon closed, Brest became the Ecole Superieure de Maistrance in 1877 then the Ecole Technique Superieure des Constructions Navales in 1912. The Ecole Technique Sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Artillerie Navale was created in Toulon in 1928. These two schools form the Ecoles Techniques Superieures de la Marine (ETSM). They were accredited to deliver engineering diplomas in 1934. In 1841, the Toulon school was closed and the Brest Ecole Technique Sup\u00e9rieure des Constructions Navales was the only surviving school. It joined forces with the graduate schools in land armaments and aeronautics in 1971 to form the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Ing\u00e9nieurs des Etudes et Techniques d\u2019Armement (ENSIETA). Instituted by decree on 17 June 1975, at first it taught on 2 sites, Brest and Arcueil, before merging  onto the Brest site in 1986.\n\nOriginally exclusively dedicated to training military engineers to the requirements of the French Ministry of Defense, the school was progressively opened up to civilian students from 1988. The number of civilian students increased dramatically in the 1990s in parallel with the military cutbacks linked to restructuring plans.\n\nIn December 2000, ENSIETA changed its name to ENSTA Bretagne and became a founder member of the ENSTA Group along with ENSTA ParisTech. This group aims to receive other high level student engineers as part of its development plans.\n\n=== The strategic partnership IMT-Atlantique-ENSTA Bretagne ===\nOn 2 February 2017, the directors of IMT Atlantique and ENSTA Bretagne signed a partnership agreement between the two establishments in the presence of the Minister for Defense, Jean-Yves Le Drian. The agreement aims to establish coordinated activities in the short and long term, covering training (especially through student exchanges between the 2 schools), research, innovation, internationalization and the creation of an engineering center of excellence and reference.\n\n== Network ==\nENSTA Bretagne is an administrator of the \u00ab France Energies Marines \u00bb and competitivity clusters \u00ab Mer Bretagne Atlantique \u00bb and \u00ab iD4car \u00bb. ENSTA Bretagne is also an administrator of the Universit\u00e9 Bretagne-Loire (UBL). ENSTA Bretagne is also a member of the competitivity clusters \u201cImages et R\u00e9seaux\u201d and \u201cEMC2\u201d. Finally, since December 2010, the school is a founder member of the ENSTA Group.\n\n== Training ==\n\n=== General Engineer ===\nThere are generally 180 students in a year (85% civilian and 15% military) who are mostly recruited through the Mines T\u00e9l\u00e9com competitive entry exams. ENSTA Bretagne engineering degrees are accredited by the Commission des Titres d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur (CTI) and have been certified EURACE  (European label given by the CTI).\n\nThe first year of studies is followed by all the students in the school in general subjects at a graduate level (mathematics, informatics, mechanics, electronics, management, finance, scientific studies etc.)\n\nEight core subjects and 21 profiles are then proposed from the second year onwards\n\n*Observation Systems and Artificial Intelligence\n*Security and Digital System\n*Robotics\n*Naval architecture and offshore engineering<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/ship-design-la-nouvelle-formation-de-lensta-bretagne-et-lensa-fait-sa-rentree Ship Design : La nouvelle formation de l'ENSTA Bretagne et l'ENSA fait sa rentr\u00e9e]</ref>\n*Vehicle Architecture and Modeling\n*Pyrotechnics Systems\n*Hydrography and Oceanography<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.planetecampus.com/etudes/40553-ensta-bretagne-un-programme-erasmus-en-hydrographie-et-oceanographie ENSTA BRETAGNE : UN PROGRAMME ERASMUS EN HYDROGRAPHIE ET OC\u00c9ANOGRAPHIE]</ref>\n*Engineering and Management Organizations since 2010\n\n=== Apprentice engineers ===\nSince 2006, ENSTA Bretagne has proposed a 3-year apprenticeship general engineer course.

ENSTA Bretagne is co-accredited to award a doctorate in two doctoral schools:\n\n* UBL \u2013 Sciences for Engineers\n* UBL- Maths ICST\n\n== Student Life ==\nENSTA Bretagne and the students through their student union, propose sporting events, sailing, music, theater, student evenings concerts etc.\n\nThe student union (BDE) runs all the extra curricula activities proposed to the students: evenings, sporting events, galas, the integration weekend (welcoming the new students), the student/teacher day etc. It organizes events in the student building and common room and coordinates the clubs.\n\nThe student sports union (BDS) proposes numerous sporting activities: rugby, handball, volleyball, football, basketball, swimming, fencing, table tennis, badminton, judo, diving, cycling, sailing etc.  which can mostly be carried out using the school\u2019s equipment and facilities. ENSTA Bretagne participates in the Ministry of Defense graduate schools sports tournament (the TSGED) which takes place every year on the Ecole Polytechnique campus (at Palaiseau),Croisi\u00e8re EDHEC campus etc.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch at ENSTA Bretagne, the reference point for the training, is in three departments. It answers two main objectives:\n\n* further knowledge in the fields of expertise of the school whilst satisfying the requirements of the industrial stakeholders and the Ministry of Armed Forces ;\n* ensure cutting edge scientific training for the student engineers, inspiring their curiosity, initiative and creativity\n\nENSTA Bretagne also has joint laboratories with Thales, Naval Group and IxBlue.\n\n=== Mechanics Department ===\nThe IRDL Laboratory  (the Institut de Recherche Dupuy de L\u00f4me, FRE CNRS 3744) is composed of lecturers from ENSTA Bretagne, ENIB and the two universities of Western Brittany, UBO and UBS. Their work covers the science and technology of mechanics and materials. The research is carried out in close cooperation with companies in the automotive, energy, aeronautical, health, transport industries and sectors which interact with the marine environment (naval construction, offshore, renewable marine energies).\n\n=== The Information and Communication Science and Technology Department (ICST) ===\nThe Lab-STICC (the French acronym for the Information and Communication Science, Technology and Knowledge Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6285) comprises 180 lecturers from IMT-Atlantique Bretagne \u2013 Pays de Loire, UBO, UBS (the University of Lorient-Vannes), ENIB and ENSTA Bretagne.\n\nENSTA Bretagne is the 3rd most important contributor to the laboratory. It is active in 11 of the 17 themed research teams .\n\n=== Department of Social and Human Sciences (SHS) ===\nThe Training Research Center (CRF-EA 1410) is composed of 30 lecturers from CNAM Paris (the main establishment), Centrale-Supelec, the University of \u00c9vry and ENSTA Bretagne.

Instituted by decree on 17 June 1975, at first it taught on 2 sites, Brest and Arcueil, before merging  onto the Brest site in 1986.\n\nOriginally exclusively dedicated to training military engineers to the requirements of the French Ministry of Defense, the school was progressively opened up to civilian students from 1988. The number of civilian students increased dramatically in the 1990s in parallel with the military cutbacks linked to restructuring plans.\n\nIn December 2000, ENSIETA changed its name to ENSTA Bretagne and became a founder member of the ENSTA Group along with ENSTA ParisTech. This group aims to receive other high level student engineers as part of its development plans.\n\n=== The strategic partnership IMT-Atlantique-ENSTA Bretagne ===\nOn 2 February 2017, the directors of IMT Atlantique and ENSTA Bretagne signed a partnership agreement between the two establishments in the presence of the Minister for Defense, Jean-Yves Le Drian. The agreement aims to establish coordinated activities in the short and long term, covering training (especially through student exchanges between the 2 schools), research, innovation, internationalization and the creation of an engineering center of excellence and reference.\n\n== Network ==\nENSTA Bretagne is an administrator of the \u00ab France Energies Marines \u00bb and competitivity clusters \u00ab Mer Bretagne Atlantique \u00bb and \u00ab iD4car \u00bb. ENSTA Bretagne is also an administrator of the Universit\u00e9 Bretagne-Loire (UBL). ENSTA Bretagne is also a member of the competitivity clusters \u201cImages et R\u00e9seaux\u201d and \u201cEMC2\u201d. Finally, since December 2010, the school is a founder member of the ENSTA Group.\n\n== Training ==\n\n=== General Engineer ===\nThere are generally 180 students in a year (85% civilian and 15% military) who are mostly recruited through the Mines T\u00e9l\u00e9com competitive entry exams. ENSTA Bretagne engineering degrees are accredited by the Commission des Titres d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur (CTI) and have been certified EURACE  (European label given by the CTI).\n\nThe first year of studies is followed by all the students in the school in general subjects at a graduate level (mathematics, informatics, mechanics, electronics, management, finance, scientific studies etc.)\n\nEight core subjects and 21 profiles are then proposed from the second year onwards\n\n*Observation Systems and Artificial Intelligence\n*Security and Digital System\n*Robotics\n*Naval architecture and offshore engineering<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/ship-design-la-nouvelle-formation-de-lensta-bretagne-et-lensa-fait-sa-rentree Ship Design : La nouvelle formation de l'ENSTA Bretagne et l'ENSA fait sa rentr\u00e9e]</ref>\n*Vehicle Architecture and Modeling\n*Pyrotechnics Systems\n*Hydrography and Oceanography<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.planetecampus.com/etudes/40553-ensta-bretagne-un-programme-erasmus-en-hydrographie-et-oceanographie ENSTA BRETAGNE : UN PROGRAMME ERASMUS EN HYDROGRAPHIE ET OC\u00c9ANOGRAPHIE]</ref>\n*Engineering and Management Organizations since 2010\n\n=== Apprentice engineers ===\nSince 2006, ENSTA Bretagne has proposed a 3-year apprenticeship general engineer course. There are 3 specializations (Embedded Systems, Vehicle Architecture and Naval Platforms) and a complementary course (Company Sciences).\n\n=== Masters ===\n\n* International Master of Automobile Engineering\n* Master of Maritime Engineering\n* Master of Hydrography Category A(FIG OHI)\n* Master of Mobile Robotics \u2013 Application in Marine Robotics\n* Master of Architecture and Security of Electronic Systems and Software\n\n=== Advanced Masters ===\nThese training courses (of a 6-year post Baccalaureate level) are accredited by the [[Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00e9coles|Conference des Grandes Ecoles]]:\n\n* Pyrotechnics and Propulsion\n* Specialist in Renewable Marine Energies\n* Marine Engineering/Offshore and Naval Architecture, \u00bbOffshore and Naval Engineering \u00bb or \u00ab Naval Architecture and Engineering : Ship Design \u00bb options\n* Maritime Project Management\n* Location and Multi-Sensor Systems Engineering\n\n=== PhDs ===\nEvery year, ENSTA Bretagne receives around one hundred PhD students (8 years post Baccalaureate level) in its research departments. ENSTA Bretagne is co-accredited to award a doctorate in two doctoral schools:\n\n* UBL \u2013 Sciences for Engineers\n* UBL- Maths ICST\n\n== Student Life ==\nENSTA Bretagne and the students through their student union, propose sporting events, sailing, music, theater, student evenings concerts etc.\n\nThe student union (BDE) runs all the extra curricula activities proposed to the students: evenings, sporting events, galas, the integration weekend (welcoming the new students), the student/teacher day etc. It organizes events in the student building and common room and coordinates the clubs.\n\nThe student sports union (BDS) proposes numerous sporting activities: rugby, handball, volleyball, football, basketball, swimming, fencing, table tennis, badminton, judo, diving, cycling, sailing etc.  which can mostly be carried out using the school\u2019s equipment and facilities. ENSTA Bretagne participates in the Ministry of Defense graduate schools sports tournament (the TSGED) which takes place every year on the Ecole Polytechnique campus (at Palaiseau),Croisi\u00e8re EDHEC campus etc.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch at ENSTA Bretagne, the reference point for the training, is in three departments. It answers two main objectives:\n\n* further knowledge in the fields of expertise of the school whilst satisfying the requirements of the industrial stakeholders and the Ministry of Armed Forces ;\n* ensure cutting edge scientific training for the student engineers, inspiring their curiosity, initiative and creativity\n\nENSTA Bretagne also has joint laboratories with Thales, Naval Group and IxBlue.\n\n=== Mechanics Department ===\nThe IRDL Laboratory  (the Institut de Recherche Dupuy de L\u00f4me, FRE CNRS 3744) is composed of lecturers from ENSTA Bretagne, ENIB and the two universities of Western Brittany, UBO and UBS. Their work covers the science and technology of mechanics and materials. The research is carried out in close cooperation with companies in the automotive, energy, aeronautical, health, transport industries and sectors which interact with the marine environment (naval construction, offshore, renewable marine energies).\n\n=== The Information and Communication Science and Technology Department (ICST) ===\nThe Lab-STICC (the French acronym for the Information and Communication Science, Technology and Knowledge Laboratory, UMR CNRS 6285) comprises 180 lecturers from IMT-Atlantique Bretagne \u2013 Pays de Loire, UBO, UBS (the University of Lorient-Vannes), ENIB and ENSTA Bretagne.\n\nENSTA Bretagne is the 3rd most important contributor to the laboratory. It is active in 11 of the 17 themed research teams .\n\n=== Department of Social and Human Sciences (SHS) ===\nThe Training Research Center (CRF-EA 1410) is composed of 30 lecturers from CNAM Paris (the main establishment), Centrale-Supelec, the University of \u00c9vry and ENSTA Bretagne. The SHS research activities are a logical extension of the engineer training. They cover the knowledge of engineers and executives, their training and professional socialization, as well as the social, ethical and scientific issues of their activities.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en/ ENSTA Bretagne website in English]\n\n{{Coord|48|25|8|N|4|28|21|W|type:edu_region:FR|display=title}}\n\n{{Conf\u00e9rence des Grandes \u00c9coles}}\n{{\u00c9tablissement public \u00e0 caract\u00e8re administratif}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ecole nationale superieure des ingenieurs des etudes et techniques d'armement}}\n[[Category:Engineering universities and colleges in France]]\n[[Category:Education in Brest, France]]\n", "name_user": "Fremur", "label": "safe", "comment": "vectorized logo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_de_techniques_avanc%C3%A9es_Bretagne"}
