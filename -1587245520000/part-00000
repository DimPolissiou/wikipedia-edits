The country has ambitious renewable energy goals for the future, including using renewable energy for 100% of its energy needs in all sectors including transport by 2050.\n\nIn the heating sector the country has long used and continues to develop [[district heating]] (DH) networks. Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler. One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://stateofgreen.com/files/download/1401|title=pg.13, The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable. Danish Energy Agency.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The development of district heating technology has led Denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] is also widely used. This is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity. Power stations designed to do this are known as [[Combined Heat and Power Generation|Combined Heat and Power]]<nowiki/> (CHP) stations. CHP stations in Denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system. Thus CHP stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems. Heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other. By 2013 the use of CHP stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in Denmark by 11%.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDanish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.\n\n== Energy consumption and objectives ==\n[[File:Gross Energy Consumption in Denmark by Type.png|thumb|360x360px|Gross Energy Consumption in Denmark (PJ) 1990\u20132015.

This has increased energy conversion efficiency, reducing conversion losses by 28% or 7% relative to gross energy consumption.<ref name=\":7\" /> Put simply smaller and decentralised CHP plants use fuels far more efficiently than older centralised power plants, and wind power has no fossil fuel to waste. Thus the growth of these two sources (10% during the period)<ref name=\":7\" /> has displaced fossil fuels by more than a one-to-one ratio. The use of Biofuels in local CHP plants has further displaced fossil fuel consumption. The figures in the table above show that whilst the reduction in fossil fuel use has been most pronounced in coal use, there has also been a significant reduction in oil and natural gas usage since 2000.  Oil has fared better than the other fuels because it still dominates usage in the transport sector and alternative fuels and transport solutions are not yet widely deployed.

The heating and cooling sector (also known as the thermal sector) includes domestic heating and air conditioning, industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally. The next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6%, followed by the electricity sector at 19.8%. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be {{convert|16.4|Mtoe|TWh}} by 2020. In order to meet Denmarks overall target for 30% use of renewable energy in Gross final energy consumption, projected to {{convert|4.9|Mtoe|TWh|abbr=on}}, by 2020 (it was 17% in 2005) targets have been set for each sector. Renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8% in the heating and cooling sector, 51.9% in the electricity sector and 10.1% in the transport sector.\n\nThe energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, [[primary energy]] consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark's total final energy consumption was {{convert|607|PJ|TWh}} whilst its primary energy consumption was {{convert|763|PJ|TWh}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/DK_Annual%20Report%202015_en.pdf|title=Denmark's annual reporting under Article 24(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in [[Thermal power station|thermal electricity]] sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. Denmark is one of the world's most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries.\n\n== Electricity sector  ==\n\n=== Production by source ===\n{{Pie chart\n | caption=Percentage of electricity generation in Denmark by source in 2017 <ref name=\"2018 report\" />.\n | label1 = [[Wind power|Wind]]\n | value1 = 50.2 | color1 = #00b050\n | label2 = [[Wood fuel|Wood]]\n | value2 = 12.2 | color2 = #602e04\n | label3 = [[Solar power|Solar]]\n | value3 = 2.7 | color3 = #ffc000\n | label4 = [[Waste]]\n | value4 = 2.5 | color4 = #7030a0\n | label5 = [[Straw]]\n | value5 = 1.9 | color5 = #f15a17\n | label6 = [[Biogas]]\n | value6 = 1.9 | color6 = #c00000\n | label7 = [[Hydropower|Hydro]]\n | value7 = 0.1 | color7 = #00b0f0\n | label8 = [[Non-renewable resource|Non Renewable]]\n | value8 = 28.6 | color8 = #000000\n }}\n\nIn 2017 wind was the major source of Denmark's net electricity generation, with 50.2 percent of the total yearly production.

[[Solar power]] has grown significantly in recent years from a low base and provides a further 2.7% share.[[Hydroelectricity]] provided just 0.1% of net national generation but the country maintains strong links to its neighboring countries large hydroelectric reserves.

Since 2007 most of the growth in RE electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation (accounting for +56.9% of total generation growth), thermal generation from RE fuels added an additional 6.5%, Solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 GWh (5.7%) since 2012.\n\n=== Reduction in fossil fuel generated electricity  ===\n[[File:_Net_electricity_generation_from_renewable_and_fossil_fuel_sources_in_Denmark.png|right|459x459px|thumb|Net electricity generation from renewable and fossil fuel sources in Denmark]]\nRenewable energy generation in Denmark increased from 10.4 TWh to 17.6 TWh between 2007 and 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Fossil fuel generation fell from 26.3 TWh in 2007 to 12.4 TWh in 2014.<ref name=\":5\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nSo how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days? Denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide. One of the ways the country manages it, is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high (Some days Denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone than the entire country requires). Much of the power is exported and stored in Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] (storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher). On calm days the power can be reimported. The country also imports and exports electricity to Germany and across the [[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Nordic region]] which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day. As electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area. These long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the Nordic region and more widely across Europe.\n\nThe country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources. Many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed CHP power plants across the country. The production and dispersion of electricity across Denmark, the Nordic region and Germany can be viewed in real time on the Energinet.dk website. The site illustrates wind and power production, electricity imports and exports, and the contribution made by CHP plants to both district heating and stabilising electricity production.

The country has ambitious renewable energy goals for the future, including using renewable energy for 100% of its energy needs in all sectors including transport by 2050.\n\nIn the heating sector the country has long used and continues to develop [[district heating]] (DH) networks. Hot water or steam is produced centrally and then distributed through a network of insulated pipes to high population areas. Houses within a district heating area have heat exchangers installed instead of boilers for their heating and hot water requirements. The heat exchanger keeps the two water systems separate and means that heat can be adjusted as with a familiar domestic boiler. One simple but important innovation in the district heating network was the development of internally insulated pipes. The two pipes taking and receiving the return of water are placed inside a much larger pipe and insulating material is set so as to fill the figure eight shaped void between the two smaller and the large pipe. In 2013 district heating supplied over 60% of all households in Denmark with heating and hot water.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://stateofgreen.com/files/download/1401|title=pg.13, The Danish Energy Model, Innovative, Efficient and Sustainable. Danish Energy Agency.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The development of district heating technology has led Denmark to become a world leader in industrial pump and thermostat designs and its products are used in many industries worldwide.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] is also widely used. This is a process that extracts the waste heat produced when generating electricity. Power stations designed to do this are known as [[Combined Heat and Power Generation|Combined Heat and Power]]<nowiki/> (CHP) stations. CHP stations in Denmark are often sized to provide the heat required for the local district heating system. Thus CHP stations produce both electricity for the grid and heat for district heating systems. Heat can be stored in large industrial hot water tanks for several days allowing electricity and heat supply to be provided time independently from each other. By 2013 the use of CHP stations had reduced the overall energy consumption in Denmark by 11%.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nDanish electricity generation has become increasingly decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many of these smaller stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.\n\n== Energy consumption and objectives ==\n[[File:Gross Energy Consumption in Denmark by Type.png|thumb|360x360px|Gross Energy Consumption in Denmark (PJ) 1990\u20132015.

The use of Biofuels in local CHP plants has further displaced fossil fuel consumption. The figures in the table above show that whilst the reduction in fossil fuel use has been most pronounced in coal use, there has also been a significant reduction in oil and natural gas usage since 2000.  Oil has fared better than the other fuels because it still dominates usage in the transport sector and alternative fuels and transport solutions are not yet widely deployed.

The heating and cooling sector (also known as the thermal sector) includes domestic heating and air conditioning, industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally. The next largest share is the transport sector at 33.6%, followed by the electricity sector at 19.8%. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be {{convert|16.4|Mtoe|TWh}} by 2020. In order to meet Denmarks overall target for 30% use of renewable energy in Gross final energy consumption, projected to {{convert|4.9|Mtoe|TWh|abbr=on}}, by 2020 (it was 17% in 2005) targets have been set for each sector. Renewable energy use is expected to be 39.8% in the heating and cooling sector, 51.9% in the electricity sector and 10.1% in the transport sector.\n\nThe energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, [[primary energy]] consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. In 2013 Denmark's total final energy consumption was {{convert|607|PJ|TWh}} whilst its primary energy consumption was {{convert|763|PJ|TWh}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/DK_Annual%20Report%202015_en.pdf|title=Denmark's annual reporting under Article 24(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Most of the approximately 25% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in [[Thermal power station|thermal electricity]] sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. Denmark is one of the world's most fuel efficient countries and the difference between the two measures is smaller than many other countries.\n\n== Electricity sector  ==\n\n=== Production by source ===\n{{Pie chart\n | caption=Percentage of electricity generation in Denmark by source in 2017 <ref name=\"2018 report\" />.\n | label1 = [[Wind power|Wind]]\n | value1 = 50.2 | color1 = #00b050\n | label2 = [[Wood fuel|Wood]]\n | value2 = 12.2 | color2 = #602e04\n | label3 = [[Solar power|Solar]]\n | value3 = 2.7 | color3 = #ffc000\n | label4 = [[Waste]]\n | value4 = 2.5 | color4 = #7030a0\n | label5 = [[Straw]]\n | value5 = 1.9 | color5 = #f15a17\n | label6 = [[Biogas]]\n | value6 = 1.9 | color6 = #c00000\n | label7 = [[Hydropower|Hydro]]\n | value7 = 0.1 | color7 = #00b0f0\n | label8 = [[Non-renewable resource|Non Renewable]]\n | value8 = 28.6 | color8 = #000000\n }}\n\nIn 2017 wind was the major source of Denmark's net electricity generation, with 50.2 percent of the total yearly production.

Total renewable electricity generation grew from 10.4 TWh in 2007 to 17.6 TWh by 2014, a rise of 69%. Since 2007 most of the growth in RE electricity generation continues to be the result of growing wind power generation (accounting for +56.9% of total generation growth), thermal generation from RE fuels added an additional 6.5%, Solar power has also made an impact as a new power source of an additional 597 GWh (5.7%) since 2012.\n\n=== Reduction in fossil fuel generated electricity  ===\n[[File:_Net_electricity_generation_from_renewable_and_fossil_fuel_sources_in_Denmark.png|right|459x459px|thumb|Net electricity generation from renewable and fossil fuel sources in Denmark]]\nRenewable energy generation in Denmark increased from 10.4 TWh to 17.6 TWh between 2007 and 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Fossil fuel generation fell from 26.3 TWh in 2007 to 12.4 TWh in 2014.<ref name=\":5\"/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Electricity generated from renewables first exceeded electricity from fossil fuels in 2012 and again in 2014.\n\nSo how does a country which generates the largest share of its electricity needs from wind power cope on calm windless days? Denmark sees this challenge as an opportunity to develop new solutions and in so doing is transforming its energy sector and upgrading its technological and engineering capability and is now exporting these worldwide. One of the ways the country manages it, is by exporting electricity on days when wind production is very high (Some days Denmark produces more electricity from wind power alone than the entire country requires). Much of the power is exported and stored in Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric systems via the system of [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]] (storing power for future use by pumping reservoir levels up higher). On calm days the power can be reimported. The country also imports and exports electricity to Germany and across the [[Governance of hydropower in Scandinavia|Nordic region]] which moves power to where it is most in demand given production conditions on each day. As electricity can be transported thousands of kilometres with only a few percentage point transmission losses the load and variability can be spread across a wider and more stable geographic area. These long distance transmission lines are being upgraded across both the Nordic region and more widely across Europe.\n\nThe country has also developed power plants which can increase their output much more rapidly than traditional ones to respond to fluctuating production from wind sources. Many of these plants are the many smaller and dispersed CHP power plants across the country. The production and dispersion of electricity across Denmark, the Nordic region and Germany can be viewed in real time on the Energinet.dk website. The site illustrates wind and power production, electricity imports and exports, and the contribution made by CHP plants to both district heating and stabilising electricity production.

Overall about 2.6% of national electricity was generated by RE generation from waste.<ref name=\":103\"/> Denmark incinerates close to 3 million tonnes of waste each year to produce electricity and heat, most of it is produced domestically with a smaller share imported from abroad. There are 28 waste incineration plants in the country. The waste powered CHP plants may also co burn additional fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, but increasingly biomass is used to improve the performance of waste energy production. Only the carbon neutral biodegradable part of waste is classified as renewable energy generation which was defined as 55 percent of total waste from 2011 (in 2009 it was 58.8 percent).<ref name=\":103\"/> Total waste provided 20 percent of district heating generation and between 4 and 5 percent of electricity generation in the country.<ref name=\":9\" /> Energy production from waste over the next ten years is expected to remain at similar levels, new pre treatments of waste may however be developed.\n\n'''Biogas.'''\n\nBiogas generation has been rising steadily from a low base and reached 447 GWh of electricity production in 2014 contributing about 1.5% of Denmarks electricity. Approximately 75% of biogas generating plants are 3 MW or smaller in size which numbered approximately 120 plants in 2015.<ref name=\":103\"/> A further 15 larger CHP plants account for the remaining approximately 25% of biogas consumption and co-fire biogas, mostly with natural gas. The largest source of [[Biogas]] is from manure, other sources include water treatment plants and landfill sites. Many of the smaller plants are located on farms and or other sources of biogas. Smaller biogas plants tend not to contribute heat to district heating networks. Denmark intends to increase production and use of biogas from {{convert|4|PJ|TWh}} consumption in 2015 to {{convert|17|PJ|TWh}} by 2020 with the goal of using 50% of manure in the country.<ref name=\":103\"/> Most of the new biogas is likely to be injected directly into the gas system and used for industry and transport.\n\n'''Biomass.'''\n\n[[Biomass]] provides the largest share of renewable energy in Denmark when considering the electricity sector, heating and cooling sector and transport sector combined. The fuel contributed to approximately 8.6% of total electricity generation in Denmark generating 2.6 TWh of electricity in 2014.<ref name=\":103\"/> Total consumption of biomass amounted to {{convert|107|PJ|TWh}} in 2013.<ref name=\":103\"/> There were 39 CHP plants using biomass as a fuel in 2014 consuming approximately 2.7 million tonnes to produce heat and power, corresponding to {{convert|40.9|PJ|TWh}} consumption in that year.<ref name=\":103\"/> Biomass is sometimes co-fired with other fuels including a small percentage that is co-fired with waste.

By 2014 this had risen to 597 GWh.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> The large increase in solar deployment in 2012 was aided by incentives including tax credits and net settlement for produced power. In response to a dramatic rise in solar installations during that year the incentives were revised downwards for 2013 and a smaller rise occurred during that year. Smaller solar installations predominate with 73% of PV cell capacity being less than 6&nbsp;kW by the end of 2014,<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://energinet.dk/EN/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/VE-produktion/Sider/Sol.aspx|title=Energinet.dk / Climate and Environment / Solar Power|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> a sign that incentives have largely benefitted households.

Two prison guards died. Bill Miller was shot by Joe Cretzer, and Harold Stites was mistakenly shot by the officers on the hill outside who were firing into the D block.  Three inmates, Bernie Coy, Joe Cretzer and Marv Hubbard, were all killed  by countless rounds of rifle fire, grenades, tear gas and deck gun shells of the Coast Guard, US Marine Corps,  Prison and  Police Department. It was assumed that the inmates had obtain automatic rifles and the uprising was organized by six inmates :  Clarence Carnes Inmate no. 714, Bernard Coy Inmate no. 415, Sam Shockley Inmate no. 462, Miran Thompson Inmate no. 729, Joseph Paul Cretzer Inmate no. 548 and Marvin Hubbard Inmate no. 645. Mainly by the bias of the sensation-loving press and media, they were already labeled killers.\n\n==Background==\nSam Shockley was the son of Richard \"Dick\" Shockley, and Annyer Eugenia Bearden, who died when Samuel was 7 years old.  He was born in Cerrogordo Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper with eight children. By his first wife Norma Louise Bearden: Bryant Lunsford in 1889, and by Annyer Eugenia Bearden, his second wife: Myrtle Lee in 1900, Frank in 1901, Anna Belle in 1904, Patrick in 1907, Samuel Richard in 1909, and Ruth in 1913, Richard Samuel born in 1918 by his third wife, Sally Barton, who died of malaria fever in 1920. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, looked after the children during the day, while their parents worked the land. The girl had Sam on her arm when she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. In panic she ran out of the house, still holding Sam. There she threw Sam away and collapsed. Both children were lying outside for six hours, covered in burns.  Baby Sam had taken a hard blow from the fall.  Samuel Shockley was taken out of school by his father when he was twelve years old and strong enough to work  the fields. His formal education ended at the third grade, and by the age of thirteen he exhibited signs of serious instability. Sam started running away from home after the death of his stepmother. His father died in 1932. Sam left the family in 1927 and became a transient. Soon after he hit the road he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in [[Garvin County, Oklahoma|Garvin County]] and was sent for one year to the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]] at [[Granite, Oklahoma]]. \n\nWhile in prison Sam Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929, but he sustained a second beating by a police officer, which inflicted further head trauma. In June, 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone Idaho), but the marriage only lasted 1.5 years. They divorce in June 1939. Sam Shockley and Edward Johnson were arrested in March 1938 for robbing a man of his car, bank robbery and kidnapping Mr and Mrs D.F. Pendley, both employees of the bank of [[Paoli, Oklahoma]], and sentenced to life imprisonment at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]] on May 16, 1938. Examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, it was determined that Sam Shockley had a low [[IQ]] of 68 and the mental age of a 10-year 10-month-old child.  He suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability. He was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than confine the obviously mentally deranged prisoner in the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]], the administration of Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz in September, 1938.\n\nWhen he was transferred to Alcatraz from Leavenworth, it was felt the strict routine there would better manage him. Throughout the early 1940s at Alcatraz, Sam Shockley's condition continued to deteriorate because he was placed for 3 years in the D block isolation section, and for most of the time in the Hole or Dungeon, the darkened stripped cells on the ground level. Here he spent most of his time in darkness.  At night he was only allowed a blanket and a mattress, during the rest of the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. At Alcatraz,  Sam Shockley's mental condition worsened. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of an eight-year-old child.  In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described Sam Shockley as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On 21 May 1941 there was an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops involving [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]], Arnold \"Shorty\" Kyle, Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber), and Sam Shockley. During the escape attempt from the mat shop, the men held a number of guards hostage. The convicts began sawing through the bars from the inside. After an hour, the convicts were unable to cut through the steel bars. The convicts surrendered after Captain [[Paul J. Madigan|Paul Madigan]], captain of the guard, arrived in the mat shop and the hostages were released unharmed. Lloyd Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden [[James A. Johnston|James Johnston]] and convinced him that Sam Shockley was not involved in the plot. Sam Shockley was released and sent back to his cell.\n\nOn May 2, 1946, during the escape the inmates [[Bernard Coy]], [[Joseph Cretzer]], and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They opened the D isolation cell block door to free Rufus Whitey Franklin, who was still confined to the isolation cell and for all Coy knew, still in the darkened solitary cell behind two sets of doors; the outer door was made of solid steel and the inner door was electronically operated and barred.\n\nBernie Coy had planned to take control of the cell house and D block so that Rufus Franklin could be released once the escape was underway. Although it appeared to the inmates that they had all the cell house keys, none of them fit the lock in the rear door of the cell house which led to the recreation yard. It was through this door that the convicts intended to leave the cell house. The key 107 opened the rear door to the recreation yard but custodial guard Joseph Burdett hid this key under the wall seat of cell 404. The escape attempt failed due to the jamming of the recreation yard door lock, because if the wrong key was used and tried several times the system would block completely. All this turned into an armed confrontation which lasted 48 hours. Two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. Three guards were critically injured and 10 more guards sustained lesser injuries.\n\nLawyer William A. Sullivan, who was appointed by Judge [[Louis Earl Goodman|Louis Goodman]] to defend Sam Shockley in the Alcatraz Trial, elicited from Carl W. Sundstrom, custodial guard, that at no time did he ever see a weapon in Sam Shockley's hands. Shockley did attack Sundstrom, but Sundstrom never was injured by him. Sundstrom also stated that Sam Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp and Louis Fleish made statements that Sam Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him. He looked like a clown, which amused the onlookers. He repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W.H. Miller.\n\nJoseph Moyle, inmate #561, testified that Sam Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Sam Shockley knew what was going on. He, and other inmates who testified in court, denied that they ever heard Sam Shockley urge Joseph Cretzer to shoot the guards.  Sam Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Sam Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Bernie Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Sam Shockley was, like Rufus Franklin, locked up in one of these solitary cells. The failure to release Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence.  Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness but Sullivan got a letter, handed to him by Warden Johnston, in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case.\n\nA motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not get a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, was denied by the judge. Also a transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial, Judge Goodman denied. A request for two lawyers to assist Sam Shockley was rejected, though in a weighty court case, where the death penalty can be demanded, it is very common that the defendant may take two lawyers for defense. Also a request for an independent psychiatrist doctor to testify that Shockley was mentally ill  or insane was refused. Dr Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Sam Shockley's sanity. Dr Alden had only an hour to examine Sam Shockley.\n\nThe [[Henri Young]] trial in 1941 has a lot of parallels with Sam Shockley's trial. Both were non-aggressive and mentally handicapped men.

Two prison guards died. Bill Miller was shot by Joe Cretzer, and Harold Stites was mistakenly shot by the officers on the hill outside who were firing into the D block.  Three inmates, Bernie Coy, Joe Cretzer and Marv Hubbard, were all killed  by countless rounds of rifle fire, grenades, tear gas and deck gun shells of the Coast Guard, US Marine Corps,  Prison and  Police Department. It was assumed that the inmates had obtain automatic rifles and the uprising was organized by six inmates :  Clarence Carnes Inmate no. 714, Bernard Coy Inmate no. 415, Sam Shockley Inmate no. 462, Miran Thompson Inmate no. 729, Joseph Paul Cretzer Inmate no. 548 and Marvin Hubbard Inmate no. 645. Mainly by the bias of the sensation-loving press and media, they were already labeled killers.\n\n==Background==\nSam Shockley was the son of Richard \"Dick\" Shockley, and Annyer Eugenia Bearden, who died when Samuel was 7 years old.  He was born in Cerrogordo Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper with eight children. By his first wife Norma Louise Bearden: Bryant Lunsford in 1889, and by Annyer Eugenia Bearden, his second wife: Myrtle Lee in 1900, Frank in 1901, Anna Belle in 1904, Patrick in 1907, Samuel Richard in 1909, and Ruth in 1913, Richard Samuel born in 1918 by his third wife, Sally Barton, who died of malaria fever in 1920. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, looked after the children during the day, while their parents worked the land. The girl had Sam on her arm when she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. In panic she ran out of the house, still holding Sam. There she threw Sam away and collapsed. Both children were lying outside for six hours, covered in burns.  Baby Sam had taken a hard blow from the fall.  Samuel Shockley was taken out of school by his father when he was twelve years old and strong enough to work  the fields. His formal education ended at the third grade, and by the age of thirteen he exhibited signs of serious instability. Sam started running away from home after the death of his stepmother. His father died in 1932. Sam left the family in 1927 and became a transient. Soon after he hit the road he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in [[Garvin County, Oklahoma|Garvin County]] and was sent for one year to the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]] at [[Granite, Oklahoma]]. \n\nWhile in prison Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929, but he sustained a second beating by a police officer, which inflicted further head trauma. In June, 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone Idaho), but the marriage only lasted 1.5 years. They divorce in June 1939. Shockley and Edward Johnson were arrested in March 1938 for robbing a man of his car, bank robbery and kidnapping Mr and Mrs D.F. Pendley, both employees of the bank of [[Paoli, Oklahoma]], and sentenced to life imprisonment at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]] on May 16, 1938. Examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, it was determined that Shockley had a low [[IQ]] of 68 and the mental age of a 10-year 10-month-old child.  He suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability. He was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than confine the obviously mentally deranged prisoner in the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]], the administration of Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz in September, 1938.\n\nWhen he was transferred to Alcatraz from Leavenworth, it was felt the strict routine there would better manage him. Throughout the early 1940s at Alcatraz, Shockley's condition continued to deteriorate because he was placed for 3 years in the D block isolation section, and for most of the time in the Hole or Dungeon, the darkened stripped cells on the ground level. Here he spent most of his time in darkness.  At night he was only allowed a blanket and a mattress, during the rest of the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. At Alcatraz, Shockley's mental condition worsened. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of an eight-year-old child.  In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described Shockley as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On 21 May 1941 there was an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops involving [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]], Arnold \"Shorty\" Kyle, Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber), and Shockley. During the escape attempt from the mat shop, the men held a number of guards hostage. The convicts began sawing through the bars from the inside. After an hour, the convicts were unable to cut through the steel bars. The convicts surrendered after Captain [[Paul J. Madigan|Paul Madigan]], captain of the guard, arrived in the mat shop and the hostages were released unharmed. Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden [[James A. Johnston|James Johnston]] and convinced him that Shockley was not involved in the plot. Shockley was released and sent back to his cell.\n\nOn May 2, 1946, during the escape the inmates [[Bernard Coy]], [[Joseph Cretzer]], and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They opened the D isolation cell block door to free Rufus Whitey Franklin, who was still confined to the isolation cell and for all Coy knew, still in the darkened solitary cell behind two sets of doors; the outer door was made of solid steel and the inner door was electronically operated and barred.\n\nCoy had planned to take control of the cell house and D block so that Franklin could be released once the escape was underway. Although it appeared to the inmates that they had all the cell house keys, none of them fit the lock in the rear door of the cell house which led to the recreation yard. It was through this door that the convicts intended to leave the cell house. The key 107 opened the rear door to the recreation yard but custodial guard Joseph Burdett hid this key under the wall seat of cell 404. The escape attempt failed due to the jamming of the recreation yard door lock, because if the wrong key was used and tried several times the system would block completely. All this turned into an armed confrontation which lasted 48 hours. Two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. Three guards were critically injured and 10 more guards sustained lesser injuries.\n\nLawyer William A. Sullivan, who was appointed by Judge [[Louis Earl Goodman|Louis Goodman]] to defend Shockley in the Alcatraz Trial, elicited from Carl W. Sundstrom, custodial guard, that at no time did he ever see a weapon in Shockley's hands. Shockley did attack Sundstrom, but Sundstrom never was injured by him. Sundstrom also stated that Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp and Louis Fleish made statements that Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him. He looked like a clown, which amused the onlookers. He repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W.H. Miller.\n\nJoseph Moyle, inmate #561, testified that Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Shockley knew what was going on. He, and other inmates who testified in court, denied that they ever heard Shockley urge Cretzer to shoot the guards.  Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Shockley was, like Rufus Franklin, locked up in one of these solitary cells. The failure to release Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence.  Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness but Sullivan got a letter, handed to him by Warden Johnston, in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case.\n\nA motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not get a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, was denied by the judge. Also a transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial, Judge Goodman denied. A request for two lawyers to assist Shockley was rejected, though in a weighty court case, where the death penalty can be demanded, it is very common that the defendant may take two lawyers for defense. Also a request for an independent psychiatrist doctor to testify that Shockley was mentally ill  or insane was refused. Dr Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Shockley's sanity. Dr Alden had only an hour to examine Shockley.\n\nThe [[Henri Young]] trial in 1941 has a lot of parallels with Shockley's trial. Both were non-aggressive and mentally handicapped men. Both had been confined for lengthy periods of time in isolation and had long records of minor misbehaviors for which they suffered harsh punishments. Both men had almost complete lack of recall of the events for which they were on trial. [[Frank J. Hennessy|Frank Hennessy]], the U.S. Attorney, and Judge Goodman feared a second Henri Young trial, in which the jury publicly attacked Warden Johnston's administration as cruel and inhumane, and demanded that Alcatraz be closed and the Administration investigated by [[United States Marshals Service|Federal authorities]].\n\nShockley, along with [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Clarence Carnes]], was found guilty of murder in the first degree at their trial December 21st 1946, before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Nineteen-year-old Carnes was spared the death penalty after some custodial officers who had been taken hostage testified that he had refrained from following instructions from Cretzer to kill them, but also due to the strong defense of his lawyer, Archer Zamloch. Although Shockley's lawyer, W.A. Sullivan, pleaded insanity, Shockley and Thompson both received death sentences, to the great disbelief of their lawyers and even the prosecuting U.S. attorney, Hennessy. [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], a good friend of Warden Johnston, denied the bid for clemency. Shockley accepted his fate and rejected any further efforts to stay the execution. They were executed simultaneously in the [[San Quentin]] [[gas chamber]] on December 3 th 1948. Shockley is buried at Pollard cemetery, [[Haworth, Oklahoma|Haworth]], [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma]].\n\n==General references==\n.   Inside Alcatraz, my time on the rock - by Jim Quillen.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. \n\nThe first cases of [[COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13.
