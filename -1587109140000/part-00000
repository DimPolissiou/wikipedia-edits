Bristol Bay is 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) long and 290&nbsp;km, (180&nbsp;mi) wide at its mouth.  A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the [[Cinder River|Cinder]], [[Egegik River|Egegik]], [[Igushik River|Igushik]], [[Kvichak River|Kvichak]], [[Meshik River|Meshik]], [[Nushagak River|Nushagak]], [[Naknek River|Naknek]], [[Togiak River|Togiak]], and [[Ugashik River|Ugashik]].\n\nUpper reaches of Bristol Bay experience some of the highest tides in the world.  One such reach, the [[Nushagak Bay]] near [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and another near [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]] in [[Kvichak Bay]] have tidal extremes in excess of 10&nbsp;m (30&nbsp; ft), ranking them &mdash; and the area &mdash; as eighth highest in the world.  Coupled with the extreme number of shoals, sandbars, and shallows, makes navigation troublesome, especially during the area's frequently strong winds.

More recently, its proximity to mineral, animal and seafood riches provided an incentive for human habitation along its shoreline. Early Russian and English exploration provided most of the non-native influences of the area. During his voyage through the area in 1778, the famed British navigator and explorer, Captain [[James Cook]] named the area \"in honor of the [[Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol|Admiral Earl of Bristol]]\" in England.\n\n=== Early settlement ===\n[[File:BristolBay4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Shore of Bristol Bay]]\nAfter establishing some temporary settlements in the late 1790s, The [[Russian American Company]] sent exploratory parties to document the coast and nearby inland areas of Bristol Bay. One of these charted the area between the [[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]] and [[Nushagak River]]s. The original Eskimo village at Naknek went through various names as recorded by the Russians after they arrived in the area in 1819 (1821-\u201cNaugeik\u201d; 1880- \u201cKinuyak\u201d; and finally Naknek as named by Russian Navy Captain Tebenkov). Later, in 1819, an [[Aleut people|Aleut]] by the name of Andrei Ustiugov drew the first intensive charts of Bristol Bay.  Additionally, ships of the [[Russian Navy]] conducted extensive surveys of the Bering Sea coastline into the mid-19th century, naming many of the geographical features commonly used today: Capes Constantine, Chichagof, Menshikof and Greig, Mounts [[Veniaminof]] and [[Mount Pavlof|Pavlof]], [[Becharof Lake]], etc. In 1883 the first salmon cannery was open in Bristol Bay\u201d <ref>https://www.nps.gov/lacl/learn/historyculture/upload/Canneries-Cabins-Caches-508-compliant-Sept-2015-low-res.pdf</ref> (Source information from the cannery article to give context on the expansion of the salmon industry in Alaska and the history of growth.\n\nThe influence of the Katmai Volcano Explosion in 1912 and the influenza epidemic in 1919 decimated the Naknek people and area. According to oral history, there were only about three original families left at that time.<ref>(https://www.nps.gov/lacl/learn/historyculture/upload/Canneries-Cabins-Caches-508-compliant-Sept-2015-low-res.pdf)</ref>\n\n=== World War Two ===\nOn July 7,{{Clarify|reason=what year?|date=June 2019}} Alaskans witnessed conflict as Japanese fishing vessels entered the waters of Bristol Bay with 10,000-ton fishing trawlers to harvest salmon.\n\nAt that time, the Fisheries Bureau prohibited the use of motorized vessels, fish traps, and purse seines in Alaska. This was to ensure a 50% escapement of the spawning salmon, to guarantee their sustainability.\n\nThe Japanese fleet was composed of diesel-powered steel vessels. The Japanese had a technological advantage over the American fisherman and dominated the bay that summer.\n\nIn 1938, the United States agreed with Japan that the Japanese would refrain from fishing in Alaskan waters. This agreement was honored until Japan and the United States entered World War 2. In the 1950s, Japan was strengthening its fishing presence in the Pacific; the US, Canada, and Japan passed the North Pacific Fisheries Treaty. This treaty managed the resources of the region jointly to preserve the future generations of fish. This agreement is the model for international fisheries regulations today.<ref>http://www.visitbristolbay.com/visitor-guide/cultures.html</ref>\n\n== Industry ==\n[[File:BristolBay5.jpg|thumb|Nushagak River, draining into Bristol Bay]]\n\nBristol Bay is home to the world's most abundant [[sockeye salmon]] [[fishery]] as well as strong runs of chum salmon, silver salmon, and king salmon, each occurring seasonally.<ref>La Ganga, Maria L. (December 16, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bristol-bay-leases-20141216-story.html \"Obama protects Alaska's Bristol Bay from oil and gas drilling\"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>  Kings are usually the first to run up the river followed by reds and chums.  Silvers and Pinks are the last to run up the river.\nOn an international scale, sockeye salmon are a relatively rare creature. Like other wild salmon species, sockeye harvests fluctuate but comprise 4 to 7 percent of global salmon production and 13 to 20 percent of native salmon harvests. Between 2011 and 2014, sockeye accounted for 5 percent of the world's salmon harvest by volume and 15 percent of the world's wild salmon harvest.\n\n===Commercial fishing===\nBristol Bay is home to the world's largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's freshwater tributaries. Commercial fisheries include the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main</ref> The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs.\n\nDuring the first 50 years of commercial salmon fishing in Bristol Bay, the fishing boats were restricted to sail power. When this restriction lifted in 1951, it took only seven short years to outfit all the boats (approximately 1,500) with diesel or gas engines. In the late 1920s another law was passed restricting the length of the boats to 32 feet. This law holds true even today.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main</ref>\n\n=== Canneries ===\nBristol Bay is a remote part of Alaska. The canneries preserve the freshness of the salmon which are gutted, cleaned, and processed on site. These companies have established a presence in Bristol Bay.\n\nCanneries include North Pacific Seafoods,Togiak Seafoods, Bristol Bay Setnet, Friedman Family Fisheries, Peter Pan Seafoods, Ekuk Fisheries, Big Creek Shore plant, Coffee Point Seafood, Icicle Seafoods, Wild Premium Salmon, Seafood Enterprises of Alaska, Alaska General Seafoods, Alaska Salmon Wild, Da Kine Enterprise, Extreme Salmon, Great Ruby Fish, My Girl, Naknek Family Fisheries, North Pacific Seafoods, Ocean Beauty, Silver Bay Seafoods, Trident Seafoods, Tulchina Fisheries, Diamond Lodge Smokehouse, and Nakeen Homepack.\n\n[[File:Bristol Bay shore.jpg|thumb|left|Shore of Bristol Bay near [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]]]]\nMajor industries are [[commercial fishing]] and the associated canneries, [[sport fishing]], [[hunting]] and [[tourism]].  The number of business lodges, hunting- and fishing-resorts and visitors to the nearby [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] has grown exponentially in recent years. Sports fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen targeting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).[18]\n\nThe area has also experienced significant interest in oil and mineral development, most notably with the proposed [[Pebble Mine]] on the north shore of [[Iliamna Lake]], and auctioning of leases to tracts in the southern Bristol Bay area known as the [[North Aleutians Basin]], an area which has been closed to offshore oil and gas development since a moratorium in 1998.  The draft plan by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (pending public comments until 2/5/2007), also proposes to open most of the BLM's {{convert|3600000|acres}} in the area to [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]] and oil and gas drilling.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:BristolBay1.jpg|thumb|upright|Abandoned cabin on Bristol Bay]]\nThe three largest communities of the Bristol Bay area are [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]], and [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]].  Smaller communities which dot the coastline and rivers of Bristol Bay include: [[Egegik, Alaska|Egegik]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0261|\u025b|\u0261|\u026a|k}}, [[Ekuk, Alaska|Ekuk]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|k|o\u028a|k}}, [[Igiugig, Alaska|Igiugig]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u02c8|j|\u0254\u02d0|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261}},{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} [[Manokotak, Alaska|Manokotak]] {{IPAc-en|m|\u0251\u02d0|n|\u0259|\u02c8|k|o\u028a|t|\u0251\u02d0|k}}, [[New Stuyahok, Alaska|New Stuyahok]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|u\u02d0|j|\u0259|h|\u0252|k}}, [[Newhalen, Alaska|Newhalen]], [[Nondalton, Alaska|Nondalton]], [[Pilot Point, Alaska|Pilot Point]], [[Port Heiden, Alaska|Port Heiden]], [[Ugashik, Alaska|Ugashik]] ({{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0261|\u00e6|\u0283|\u026a|k}}, and South Naknek.\n\nAll of these communities are primarily inhabited by [[Alaska Natives]], except for [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]]; the former being influenced early-on by white salmon-cannery employees of European descent and the latter being heavily populated by military personnel stationed, primarily during Cold War years, at the nearby King Salmon Air Force Station and later by visitors and employees of the nearby [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]].\n\n== Proposed Pebble Mine ==\n{{Main|Pebble Mine}}\nA mineral exploration project investigating a large [[porphyry copper]], [[gold]], and [[molybdenum]] deposit in the Bristol Bay region has been proposed and may be undertaken by British-Australian<ref>http://www.riotinto.com/documents/140415_Rio_Tinto_delivers_strong_first_quarter_production.pdf</ref> [[Rio Tinto Group]] and Japanese <ref>https://www.nrdc.org/stories/crushing-alaskas-pebble-mine</ref> [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Mitsubishi]]. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC staked a claim on the site in 2001 and with its partners, invested 500 million dollars into the project. The mining company lost all of its partners in 2011 due to increasing government regulations and distrust by its partners.\n\nBecause of the estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste that must be permanently stored in the area, which is an active earthquake zone, and Rio Tinto's environmental track record, which is seen as poor by many environmental advocacy groups, fears have been raised about the potential impact on the Bristol Bay area and its wildlife and residents. In April 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an assessment of the impact of the proposed mining operations on fisheries, wildlife, and native Alaska tribes.<ref>[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://www2.epa.gov/bristolbay Proposal to Protect the Bristol Bay Watershed]</ref> Between 2014 and May 2017, Pebble sued the EPA several times. The company argued the EPA unfairly assumed the scope of the mine before it formally filed mining plans. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC. accused the government agency of colluding with anti-mine activists to reach its conclusions.<ref>http://www.akbizmag.com/Alaska-Business-Monthly/November-2017/Pebble-Mine-Update/</ref>\n\nOn July 30th 2019, the EPA withdrew their preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-withdraws-outdated-preemptive-proposed-determination-restrict-use-pebble-deposit</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bristol Bay Borough]]\n*[[Lake and Peninsula Borough]]\n*[[Naknek, Alaska]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Bristol Bay}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107073559/http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&Template=%2Fcffiles%2Fcounties%2Fcounty.cfm&id=2164 Lake & Peninsula Borough]\n*[http://www.theborough.com/ Bristol Bay Borough]\n*[http://www.lpsd.com/ Lake and Peninsula School District]\n*[http://www.bristolbayalliance.com/ Bristol Bay Alliance]\n*[http://www.bbna.com Bristol Bay Native Association]\n*[http://www.savebristolbay.org Save Bristol Bay]\n*[http://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org Renewable Resources Coalition]\n*[http://www.bristolbaywild.com Bristol Bay Wild]\n*[http://www.pebblewatch.com Pebble Watch by Bristol Bay Native Corporation]\n*[https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1014 Arnold Haverlee Manuscripts] at Dartmouth College Library\n\n=== Technical reports ===\n*[http://library.state.ak.us/asp/edocs/2007/04/ocn131417018.pdf  Abundance, age, sex, and size statistics for Pacific herring in the Togiak district of Bristol Bay, 2004 / by Chuck Brazil.] Hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012120420/http://library.state.ak.us/asp/ Alaska State Publications Program]\n*[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo6530 Mineral Investigations in the Bristol Bay Mining District Study Area, Southwest Alaska] [[Bureau of Land Management]]\n\n{{coord|57|40|N|159|50|W|dim:500000_region:US-AK_type:waterbody|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bays of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Bristol Bay Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Dillingham Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bays of the Bering Sea]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Bristol Bay.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of Bristol Bay]]\n[[File:BristolBay2.jpg|thumb|[[Packraft]]s on Nushagak Bay]]\n[[File:Bristol Bay Fisherman.jpg|thumb|Bristol Bay fisherman]]\n'''Bristol Bay''' (''Iilgayaq'' in [[Yupik language|Central Yup'ik]], {{lang-ru|\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432 \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}<ref>[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Alaska_1844.jpg \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0440\u044f \u0438 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u0430 (1844)]</ref>) is the eastern-most arm of the [[Bering Sea]], at 57\u00b0 to 59\u00b0 North 157\u00b0 to 162\u00b0 West in [[Southwest Alaska]].

Like other wild salmon species, sockeye harvests fluctuate but comprise 4 to 7 percent of global salmon production and 13 to 20 percent of native salmon harvests. Between 2011 and 2014, sockeye accounted for 5 percent of the world's salmon harvest by volume and 15 percent of the world's wild salmon harvest.\n\n===Commercial fishing===\nBristol Bay is home to the world's largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's freshwater tributaries. Commercial fisheries include the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main</ref> The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs.\n\nDuring the first 50 years of commercial salmon fishing in Bristol Bay, the fishing boats were restricted to sail power. When this restriction lifted in 1951, it took only seven short years to outfit all the boats (approximately 1,500) with diesel or gas engines. In the late 1920s another law was passed restricting the length of the boats to 32 feet. This law holds true even today.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main</ref>\n\n=== Canneries ===\nBristol Bay is a remote part of Alaska. The canneries preserve the freshness of the salmon which are gutted, cleaned, and processed on site. These companies have established a presence in Bristol Bay.\n\nCanneries include North Pacific Seafoods,Togiak Seafoods, Bristol Bay Setnet, Friedman Family Fisheries, Peter Pan Seafoods, Ekuk Fisheries, Big Creek Shore plant, Coffee Point Seafood, Icicle Seafoods, Wild Premium Salmon, Seafood Enterprises of Alaska, Alaska General Seafoods, Alaska Salmon Wild, Da Kine Enterprise, Extreme Salmon, Great Ruby Fish, My Girl, Naknek Family Fisheries, North Pacific Seafoods, Ocean Beauty, Silver Bay Seafoods, Trident Seafoods, Tulchina Fisheries, Diamond Lodge Smokehouse, and Nakeen Homepack.\n\n[[File:Bristol Bay shore.jpg|thumb|left|Shore of Bristol Bay near [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]]]]\nMajor industries are [[commercial fishing]] and the associated canneries, [[sport fishing]], [[hunting]] and [[tourism]].  The number of business lodges, hunting- and fishing-resorts and visitors to the nearby [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] has grown exponentially in recent years. Sports fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen targeting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).[18]\n\nThe area has also experienced significant interest in oil and mineral development, most notably with the proposed [[Pebble Mine]] on the north shore of [[Iliamna Lake]], and auctioning of leases to tracts in the southern Bristol Bay area known as the [[North Aleutians Basin]], an area which has been closed to offshore oil and gas development since a moratorium in 1998.  The draft plan by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (pending public comments until 2/5/2007), also proposes to open most of the BLM's {{convert|3600000|acres}} in the area to [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]] and oil and gas drilling.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:BristolBay1.jpg|thumb|upright|Abandoned cabin on Bristol Bay]]\nThe three largest communities of the Bristol Bay area are [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]], and [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]].  Smaller communities which dot the coastline and rivers of Bristol Bay include: [[Egegik, Alaska|Egegik]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0261|\u025b|\u0261|\u026a|k}}, [[Ekuk, Alaska|Ekuk]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|k|o\u028a|k}}, [[Igiugig, Alaska|Igiugig]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u02c8|j|\u0254\u02d0|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261}},{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} [[Manokotak, Alaska|Manokotak]] {{IPAc-en|m|\u0251\u02d0|n|\u0259|\u02c8|k|o\u028a|t|\u0251\u02d0|k}}, [[New Stuyahok, Alaska|New Stuyahok]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|u\u02d0|j|\u0259|h|\u0252|k}}, [[Newhalen, Alaska|Newhalen]], [[Nondalton, Alaska|Nondalton]], [[Pilot Point, Alaska|Pilot Point]], [[Port Heiden, Alaska|Port Heiden]], [[Ugashik, Alaska|Ugashik]] ({{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0261|\u00e6|\u0283|\u026a|k}}, and South Naknek.\n\nAll of these communities are primarily inhabited by [[Alaska Natives]], except for [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]]; the former being influenced early-on by white salmon-cannery employees of European descent and the latter being heavily populated by military personnel stationed, primarily during Cold War years, at the nearby King Salmon Air Force Station and later by visitors and employees of the nearby [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]].\n\n== Proposed Pebble Mine ==\n{{Main|Pebble Mine}}\nA mineral exploration project investigating a large [[porphyry copper]], [[gold]], and [[molybdenum]] deposit in the Bristol Bay region has been proposed and may be undertaken by British-Australian<ref>http://www.riotinto.com/documents/140415_Rio_Tinto_delivers_strong_first_quarter_production.pdf</ref> [[Rio Tinto Group]] and Japanese <ref>https://www.nrdc.org/stories/crushing-alaskas-pebble-mine</ref> [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Mitsubishi]]. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC staked a claim on the site in 2001 and with its partners, invested 500 million dollars into the project. The mining company lost all of its partners in 2011 due to increasing government regulations and distrust by its partners.\n\nBecause of the estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste that must be permanently stored in the area, which is an active earthquake zone, and Rio Tinto's environmental track record, which is seen as poor by many environmental advocacy groups, fears have been raised about the potential impact on the Bristol Bay area and its wildlife and residents. In April 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an assessment of the impact of the proposed mining operations on fisheries, wildlife, and native Alaska tribes.<ref>[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://www2.epa.gov/bristolbay Proposal to Protect the Bristol Bay Watershed]</ref> Between 2014 and May 2017, Pebble sued the EPA several times. The company argued the EPA unfairly assumed the scope of the mine before it formally filed mining plans. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC. accused the government agency of colluding with anti-mine activists to reach its conclusions.<ref>http://www.akbizmag.com/Alaska-Business-Monthly/November-2017/Pebble-Mine-Update/</ref>\n\nOn July 30th 2019, the EPA withdrew their preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-withdraws-outdated-preemptive-proposed-determination-restrict-use-pebble-deposit</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bristol Bay Borough]]\n*[[Lake and Peninsula Borough]]\n*[[Naknek, Alaska]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Bristol Bay}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107073559/http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&Template=%2Fcffiles%2Fcounties%2Fcounty.cfm&id=2164 Lake & Peninsula Borough]\n*[http://www.theborough.com/ Bristol Bay Borough]\n*[http://www.lpsd.com/ Lake and Peninsula School District]\n*[http://www.bristolbayalliance.com/ Bristol Bay Alliance]\n*[http://www.bbna.com Bristol Bay Native Association]\n*[http://www.savebristolbay.org Save Bristol Bay]\n*[http://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org Renewable Resources Coalition]\n*[http://www.bristolbaywild.com Bristol Bay Wild]\n*[http://www.pebblewatch.com Pebble Watch by Bristol Bay Native Corporation]\n*[https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1014 Arnold Haverlee Manuscripts] at Dartmouth College Library\n\n=== Technical reports ===\n*[http://library.state.ak.us/asp/edocs/2007/04/ocn131417018.pdf  Abundance, age, sex, and size statistics for Pacific herring in the Togiak district of Bristol Bay, 2004 / by Chuck Brazil.] Hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012120420/http://library.state.ak.us/asp/ Alaska State Publications Program]\n*[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo6530 Mineral Investigations in the Bristol Bay Mining District Study Area, Southwest Alaska] [[Bureau of Land Management]]\n\n{{coord|57|40|N|159|50|W|dim:500000_region:US-AK_type:waterbody|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bays of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Bristol Bay Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Dillingham Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bays of the Bering Sea]]\n", "name_user": "Menchi", "label": "safe", "comment": "langtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bay"}

Called ''Akiakchagamiut'' in the 1890 census, the village had a population of 43 then. A post office was established in 1934. It incorporated as a second-class city on February 7, 1974. The city government was dissolved in 1987, in favor of traditional village council governance.\n\nA [[Federally recognized tribe|federally recognized]] [[Alaska Native tribal entity]], the [[Akiachak Native Community]], is located here. Akiachak is a Yup'ik Eskimo village with a fishing and [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] lifestyle. It has a strong traditional community, and was the first city in Alaska to dissolve its city government in favor of the Native village government.

The [[population density]] was 86.5 people per square mile (33.4/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 150 housing units at an average density of 22.2/sq&nbsp;mi (8.6/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the CDP was 3.42% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 92.31% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], and 4.27% from two or more races. 1.20% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 133 households out of which 63.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.8% were non-families. 14.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

About 16.2% of families and 21.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 25.7% of those under age 18 and 34.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\nCurrently half of the village is hooked up to a plumbing system.  The village is currently working to write a grant in order to receive federal funding to plumb the rest of the village who still use honey buckets and must get their water from the river, rain, or snow. The village would like to purchase an incinerator and use the waste heat for public buildings. Electricity is provided by Akiachak Native Community Electric Co. There is one school located in the community, attended by over 200 students each year and growing. Local hospitals or health clinics include Akiachak Health Clinic. Akiachak Health Clinic is a Primary Health facility - they do not have authorization to prescribe drugs, give birth control, or handle much more than colds, small cuts, or routine strep throat treatment which is pervasive in the community.  Most live births, birth control, injury, or serious illness will be referred to the Bethel hospital or patients may be air lifted to Anchorage in serious cases. Akiachak is classified as an isolated village. It is found in EMS Region 7A in the Yukon/Kuskokwim Region. Emergency Services have river and air access. Emergency service is provided by a health aide.\n\n==Economy and transportation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2007}}\n\nThe majority of year-round employment in Akiachak is in education and other public services. The Yupiit School District headquarters are located in the community. Residents rely on seasonal employment such as commercial fishing, construction and BLM fire-fighting. 70 residents hold commercial fishing permits, and some work at canneries in Bristol Bay. The community is developing a [[fish processing facility]] and freezer. Subsistence activities provide most food sources. Poor fish returns since 1997 have significantly affected the community.\n\nA state-owned {{convert|1649|ft|adj=on}} long by {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} wide gravel airstrip and public seaplane facilities provide scheduled and chartered services year-round to Akiachak. Relocation of the [[Akiachak Airport]] is planned for the future. Arctic Circle Air Service, Grant Aviation and Hageland Aviation offer passenger flight service.

Called ''Akiakchagamiut'' in the 1890 census, the village had a population of 43 then. A post office was established in 1934. It incorporated as a second-class city on February 7, 1974. The city government was dissolved in 1987, in favor of traditional village council governance.\n\nA [[Federally recognized tribe|federally recognized]] [[Alaska Native tribal entity]], the [[Akiachak Native Community]], is located here. Akiachak is a Yup'ik Eskimo village with a fishing and [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] lifestyle. It has a strong traditional community, and was the first city in Alaska to dissolve its city government in favor of the Native village government.

The [[population density]] was 86.5 people per square mile (33.4/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 150 housing units at an average density of 22.2/sq&nbsp;mi (8.6/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial makeup of the CDP was 3.42% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 92.31% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], and 4.27% from two or more races. 1.20% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 133 households out of which 63.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 15.8% were non-families. 14.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.40 and the average family size was 4.89.\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 44.4% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 26.5% from 25 to 44, 14.5% from 45 to 64, and 5.0% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 16.2% of families and 21.2% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 25.7% of those under age 18 and 34.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\nCurrently half of the village is hooked up to a plumbing system.  The village is currently working to write a grant in order to receive federal funding to plumb the rest of the village who still use honey buckets and must get their water from the river, rain, or snow. The village would like to purchase an incinerator and use the waste heat for public buildings. Electricity is provided by Akiachak Native Community Electric Co. There is one school located in the community, attended by over 200 students each year and growing. Local hospitals or health clinics include Akiachak Health Clinic. Akiachak Health Clinic is a Primary Health facility - they do not have authorization to prescribe drugs, give birth control, or handle much more than colds, small cuts, or routine strep throat treatment which is pervasive in the community.  Most live births, birth control, injury, or serious illness will be referred to the Bethel hospital or patients may be air lifted to Anchorage in serious cases. Akiachak is classified as an isolated village. It is found in EMS Region 7A in the Yukon/Kuskokwim Region. Emergency Services have river and air access. Emergency service is provided by a health aide.\n\n==Economy and transportation==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2007}}\n\nThe majority of year-round employment in Akiachak is in education and other public services. The Yupiit School District headquarters are located in the community. Residents rely on seasonal employment such as commercial fishing, construction and BLM fire-fighting. 70 residents hold commercial fishing permits, and some work at canneries in Bristol Bay. The community is developing a [[fish processing facility]] and freezer. Subsistence activities provide most food sources. Poor fish returns since 1997 have significantly affected the community.\n\nA state-owned {{convert|1649|ft|adj=on}} long by {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} wide gravel airstrip and public seaplane facilities provide scheduled and chartered services year-round to Akiachak. Relocation of the [[Akiachak Airport]] is planned for the future. Arctic Circle Air Service, Grant Aviation and Hageland Aviation offer passenger flight service. Boats, snowmachines and ATVs are used extensively by locals on the Kuskokwim River. A winter trail exists to Bethel (19&nbsp;mi).
