The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].\n\nTwo years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]], living with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). While working for [[Atari]], Jobs develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after seeing that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there is another company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak demonstrates the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family garage (which is a carpentry/tool center). Jobs also recruits Kottke , [[Bill Fernandez]] , ([[Victor Rasuk]]) and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.<ref name=slashdot/>\n\nTerrell's disappointment in the Apple I, inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the [[Apple II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success.\n\nApple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs denies is his child. [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Job's behavior grows more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces out [[Jef Raskin]], the original Macintosh group team 1 leader. Though the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, Scully forces Jobs out of the company in 1985.\n\nThe film jumps to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and he has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running [[NeXT]]. When Apple buys NeXT, then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] asks Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs is soon named the new CEO, and ultimately fires Amelio and also his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and strives to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there is a photo montage of the main characters paired with film clips of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Apple===\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as [[Steve Jobs]]\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as [[Daniel Kottke]]\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as [[Bill Fernandez]]\n* Eddie Hassell as [[Chris Espinosa]]\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as [[Rod Holt]]\n* [[Nelson Franklin]] as [[Bill Atkinson]]\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Andy Hertzfeld]]\n* [[Lenny Jacobson]] as [[Burrell Smith]]\n* [[Giles Matthey]] as [[Jony Ive]]\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as [[Mike Markkula]]\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[John Sculley]]\n* [[J.

[[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because \"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\"<ref name=\"slashdot\">{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: \"What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), \"thought it was hilarious.\"<ref name=slashdot/> As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, \"Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, \"Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of [[fan fiction]] about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.\n<ref name=slashdot/>\n\n[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, \"FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public.

The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].\n\nTwo years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]], living with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). While working for [[Atari]], Jobs develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after seeing that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there is another company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak demonstrates the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family garage (which is a carpentry/tool center). Jobs also recruits Kottke , [[Bill Fernandez]] , ([[Victor Rasuk]]) and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.<ref name=slashdot/>\n\nTerrell's disappointment in the Apple I, inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the [[Apple II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success.\n\nApple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs denies is his child. [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Job's behavior grows more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces out [[Jef Raskin]], the original Macintosh group team 1 leader. Though the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, Scully forces Jobs out of the company in 1985.\n\nThe film jumps to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and he has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running [[NeXT]]. When Apple buys NeXT, then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] asks Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs is soon named the new CEO, and ultimately fires Amelio and also his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and strives to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there is a photo montage of the main characters paired with film clips of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Apple===\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as [[Steve Jobs]]\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as [[Daniel Kottke]]\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as [[Bill Fernandez]]\n* Eddie Hassell as [[Chris Espinosa]]\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as [[Rod Holt]]\n* [[Nelson Franklin]] as [[Bill Atkinson]]\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Andy Hertzfeld]]\n* [[Lenny Jacobson]] as [[Burrell Smith]]\n* [[Giles Matthey]] as [[Jony Ive]]\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as [[Mike Markkula]]\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[John Sculley]]\n* [[J.

[[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because \"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\"<ref name=\"slashdot\">{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]).

I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers.\"<ref name=slashdot/> Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, \"Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of [[fan fiction]] about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.\n<ref name=slashdot/>\n\n[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, \"FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public. But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film.\"<ref>[https://twitter.com/cdespinosa/status/368618820409126914 Chris Espinosa@Twitter].
