Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.<ref name=carol/> Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism \u2013 dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).<ref name=ttgov/><ref name=apara>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57\u201359</ref>\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation, and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.<ref name=parasarthy>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91\u201392, 160\u2013162</ref> The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows.

She, goddess of wealth and prosperity, is often represented with her husband Vishnu, the god who maintains human life filled with justice and peace.

[[Amrita]], the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar ([[Ocean of Milk]]). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The [[samudra manthan]] commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. [[Vishnu]] incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn [[Garuda Purana]], [[Linga Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]], Lakshmi is said to have been born as daughter of the divine sage [[Bhrigu]] and his wife Khyati and was named ''Bhargavi''. According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the ''Devas''(god) and ''Asuras''(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk([[Ksheera Sagara]]). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow [[Kamadhenu]], [[Varuni]], [[Parijat]] tree, [[Apsaras]], [[Chandra]](the moon) and [[Dhanvantari]] with [[Amrita]](nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.<ref name=buitenen>J. A.
