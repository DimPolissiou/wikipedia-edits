{"title_page": "Yun Hyong-keun", "text_new": "{{short description|Korean artist}}\n{{Korean name|Yun}}\n'''Yun Hyong-keun''' (Korean: \uc724\ud615\uadfc, 12 April 1928 \u2013 28 December 2007) is a Korean artist. After graduating from the Hongik University, Yun became associated with the Korean Dansaekhwa (also known as Tansaekhwa) movement. Yun is well known for the smearing effects of brunt umber and ultramarine blue paints on raw canvas or linen, which reveals a Korean sensibility of reflection and meditation.\n\n==Early life==\nYun Hyong-keun was born in Cheongwon-gun (present day Cheongju), North Chungcheong Province. Thankfully, even at the height of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]], Yun had the chance to learn art from Oh Dong-myeong and Ahn Seung-gak in Cheongju Commercial School, which he graduated in 1945. From the influence of Ahn, Yun enrolled in a short-term course at Cheogju Teachers\u2019 College to study drawing for half a year in 1946. Accordingly, in the following year, although his family was against him studying in art, Yun attended the College of Fine Arts at the newly founded Seoul National University. It was at the university where Yun and [[Kim Whanki]] (1913.2.27 \u2013 1974.7.25), who was the professor supervising the university's entrance exam, first met. From then on, Yun began his art career under the tutelage of Kim, who even became Yun\u2019s father-in-law in 1960.\n\nHowever, shortly after entering SNU, Yun\u2019s hardship began. In 1948 and 1949, he was arrested, tortured, wounded and expelled from school for joining the campus-wide protests. But his most difficult times came in 1950 when the [[Korean War]] broke out. Because of his prior arrest, Yun was detained and set to be executed by a firing squad, before he miraculously escaped at the last moment. In 1956, Yun was imprisoned for six months in Seodaemun Prison, not only for partaking in the student movement while attending SNU, but also for drawing portraits for the North Korean army while Seoul was occupied.\n\nAfter his release, Yun transferred to Hongik University, where Kim was leading the art department, and graduated in 1957. In the following year, he started teaching art in high schools and submitted his works to the second and third \u201cEngagement\u201d exhibition (1962,1963, Central Public Information Center, Seoul). He held his first solo exhibition in 1966 at the Press Center Gallery located in Seoul, and in 1969 he presented his works at the 10th S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial. Yun\u2019s early works during the 1960s generally consist of lyrical and fantastical abstract paintings with blue backgrounds. Only a few of works from the 60s survive, but from their simple forms, brilliant use of colors, and subtle texture, we can clearly see Kim Whanki's influence.\n\nIn the 1970s, Yun once again found himself in a deep trouble. When Yun was teaching at Sookmyung Girls\u2019 High School in October 1972, he was unfairly charged with violating \u2018anti-communist laws\u2019 for disclosing a corruption that happened at the school. As a result, Yun was taken to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, and was detained in Seodaemun Prison for about a month. Even after his release, he was blacklisted until 1980, which means that he could not find a proper job and had to be under police surveillance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"Yun Hyong-keun: Eternally in the Realm of Old Age,\" Yun Hyong-keun(MMCA Catalog)|last=Kim|first=Inhye|publisher=The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art|year=2018|isbn=|location=Seoul|pages=16\u201323}}</ref>\n\n==Artistic Style==\nIt was not until 1973, the year Yun was released from prison, that he began dedicating himself fully to painting. Notably, it was during this period that he began to produce works in his own distinctive style which were shown during his solo exhibitions at Myongdong Gallery(1973, 1974) and Munheon Gallery(1975, 1976), Seoul, as well as in Tokyo at Muramatsu Gallery(1976) and Tokyo Gallery(1978). His works made from late 1974 until the mid-1980s are mostly made up of a rectangular canvas featuring a large portion of unmarked space flanked by two, occasionally three, columnar dark sections running up and down the entire height of the canvas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|last=Kee|first=Joan|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Minneapolis, London|pages=87}}</ref> Placing a thick cotton or hemp canvas on the floor, Yun drew broad lines from top to bottom, adding his oil colors layer upon layer until the outer edges of the canvas glow with deep near-black.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"The Work of Yun, Hyong-keun,\" Yun, Hyong-keun(Inkong Gallery catalog)|last=Love|first=Joseph|publisher=Inkong Gallery|others=Reprinted from the Munheon Gallery catalog published in 1976|year=1989|isbn=|location=Seoul|pages=21}}</ref> In his early years, Yun explained that the thesis of his paintings is \u201cthe gate of heaven and earth.\u201d To Yun, who used only two alternating colors, blue and umber, \u201cblue [was] the color of heaven, while umber [was] the color of earth.

The subtle differences among the hues disappeared, and the colors were almost purely black. Also, the surfaces became drier resulting from the reduction in the use of oil. Most of Yun\u2019s later works were painted in a more concrete form: he drew rectangles on canvas with a ruler and a pencil, covered the edges of the rectangles with tapes, and then removed the tape after painting within the taped area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"Yun is Painting,\" Hyong-keun Yun at Paris(Jean Brolly catalog)|last=Brolly|first=Jean|publisher=Jean Brolly Gallery|year=2002|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=32, 34}}</ref> But these seemingly simple works have a hidden depth just as all Yun\u2019s works do- gazing into the large black void is like plunging into a deep abyss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Yun Hyong-Keun|last=|first=|publisher=Hatze Cantz|year=2019|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=48}}</ref>\n\nThis kind of \u2018being\u2019 began to gain recognition in the west, followed by several remarkable solo exhibitions at Galerie Humanite, Nagoya(1990, 1991); Inkong Gallery, Seoul(1991); and Gallery Yamaguchi, Osaka(1989, 1992). In Europe, starting from \u201cWorking with Nature\u201d in 1992, at the Tate Gallery Liverpool, Yun took part in the inaugural exhibition of the Korean pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995. Hyundai Gallery in Seoul organized a solo show at the Basel Art Fair in 1997, and in 1998, Manfred Wandel brought together 70 of Yun's works, at the Stiftung fuer Konkrete Kunst, in Reutlingen, Germany. Jean Brolly Gallery showed works during Yun\u2019s stay in Paris, at a couple of exhibitions in the early 2000s. On the other hand, in the US, Donald Judd, impressed by Yun\u2019s work at first sight, invited him to exhibit at the Donald Judd Foundation in New York(1993), and at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa(1994, 1996).<ref>{{Cite book|title=\"A Conversation,\" Hyong-Keun Yun(Jean Brolly Gallery)|last=Kim|first=Airyung and Gautherot, Franck|publisher=Jean Brolly Gallery|year=2002|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=28, 30}}</ref>\n\n==Recent Exhibitions==\nUntil recent years after Yun's death, his works still have a strong tendency to be understood together with Korean Dansaekhwa, featuring him as the main figure who had led the movement. Yun's works were shown in various group exhibitions along with his contemporary Dansaekhwa artists: \u201cKorean Abstract Painting: 10 Perspectives,\u201d Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul(2011), \u201cDansaekhwa: Korean Monochrome Painting,\u201d National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, and Jeonbuk Museum of Art, Wanju(2012); \u201cThe Art of Dansaekhwa,\u201d Kukje Gallery, Seoul(2014); \u201cSeoul Paris Seoul,\u201d Mus\u00e9e Cernuschi, Paris(2016); \u201cRhythm in Monochrome Korean Abstract Painting,\u201d Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery, Tokyo(2017); and \u201cThe Ascetic Path: Korean DANSAEKHWA,\u201d Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, Saint Petersburg(2017).\n\nIn the meantime, there has been various essential exhibitions re-framing and redefining Yun\u2019s distinctive style. Especially, the solo exhibitions in the late 2010s held by [http://www.pkmgallery.com PKM Gallery] as the representative of the artist\u2019s estate. Yun's works has been exhibited in other prominent galleries such as Blum and Poe, Axel Vervoordt Gallery, Simon Lee Gallery and David Zwirner. Above all, Yun's first posthumous major retrospective was held at National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul in 2018, which provided a comprehensive understanding of Yun\u2019s life and his artistic style. The exhibition attracted roughly 100,000 visitors in four months and the duration of the exhibition was extended for two more months.[https://www.mmca.go.kr/eng/exhibitions/exhibitionsDetail.do?exhId=201808080001076][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeUx_atEUZ0] Moreover, the retrospective traveled to Palazzo Fortuny in Venice and coincided with the 58th Venice Biennale. The exhibition at Palazzo Fortuny was introduced as one of the best off-site and collateral exhibition during the biennale period.[https://fortuny.visitmuve.it/en/mostre-en/mostre-in-corso-en/yun-hyong-keun-a-retrospective/2019/03/18051/exhibition-3/][https://frieze.com/article/beyond-biennale-shows-see-around-venice]\n\n==Collections==\nPublic collections that hold Yun's works include: National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea; Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea; Seoul Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea; Gwangju Museum of Art, Gwangju, Korea; Daegu Art Museum, Daegu, Korea; Museum of Art, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Hongik Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea; Gacheon University, Seongnam, Korea; Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan; Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, Fukuoka, Japan; Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art, Hiroshima, Japan; Mie Prefectural Art Museum, Mie, Japan; M+ Museum, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; The Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas, USA; Chicago Art Institute, Chicago, IL, USA; Glenstone Museum, Potomac, MD, USA; Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom; Stiftung f\u00fcr Konkrete Kunst, Reutlingen, Germany; and Gorge Economou Collection, Athens, Greece.<!-- Important, do not remove this line before article has been created. -->\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
