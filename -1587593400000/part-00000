{"title_page": "Glossary of cue sports terms", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}\n{{cleanup HTML|date=February 2019}}\n<!--If editing this page is slow for you, a) try another browser (it loads several times faster in Chrome than Firefox, for example), and b) try turning off code syntax highlighting in user preferences. -->\nThe following is a glossary of traditional English-language terms used in the three overarching [[cue sports]] disciplines: ''[[carom billiards|carom (or carambole) billiards]]'' referring to the various {{gli|carom}} games played on a [[billiard table]] without {{gli|pockets}}; ''[[Pool (cue sports)|pool]]'', which denotes a host of games played on a table with six pockets; and ''[[snooker]]'', played on a large pocket table, and which has a sport culture unto itself distinct from pool. There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as [[English billiards]].\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}\n\n==Definitions and language==\nThe term \"{{gli|billiards}}\" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe labels \"[[British English|British]]\" and \"[[United Kingdom|UK]]\" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the [[British Empire]] and/or are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], as opposed to [[US English|US]] (and, often, [[Canadian English|Canadian]]) terminology.  The terms \"American\" or \"US\" as applied here refer generally to North American usage.  However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.\n\nThe term \"blackball\" is used in this glossary to refer to both [[Blackball (pool)|blackball and eight-ball pool]] as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand.  Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous (\"eight-ball pool\" is too easily confused with the related \"[[eight-ball]]\"), and blackball is globally standardized by an [[International Olympic Committee]]-recognized [[Sports governing body|governing body]], the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American {{gli|bar pool}}, and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets.  (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and [[nine-ball]] draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)\n\nForeign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. {{gli|mass\u00e9|{{lang|fr|mass\u00e9|nocat=y}}}}), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.\n\n==1\u20139{{anchor|1\u20139|!\u20139|!-9|1-9|!\u20139|1\u20139}}==\n{{Glossary}}\n\n{{Term| 1-cushion }}\n<dd> ''See the [[Straight rail billiards]] main article for the game sometimes called \"one-cushion\".'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 1-pocket }}\n<dd> ''See the [[One-pocket]] main article for the game.'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 3-ball }}\n<dd> ''See the [[Three-ball]] main article for the game.<!-- See the {{gli|3 ball|3 ball}} entry, under the \"[[#T|T]]\" section below, for the ball.-->'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 3-cushion }}\n<dd>''See the [[Three-cushion billiards]] main article for the game.'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 4-ball }}\n<dd> ''See the [[Yotsudama]] main article for the modern Asian game often called \"four-ball\".

Bar pool has rules that vary from region to region, sometimes even from venue to venue in the same city, especially in the U.S. Wise players thus ensure understanding of and agreement to the rules before engaging in a {{gli|money game}} under bar rules. Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of {{gli|ball-in-hand}} after a {{gli|foul}}, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be {{gli|call shot|called}} (including {{gli|cushion|cushions}} and other {{gli|object ball|object balls}} to be contacted) not just the {{gli|target ball}} and {{gli|pocket}}. Bar pool has evolved into this \"nitpicky\" version principally to make the games last longer, since bar pool is typically played on coin-operated tables that cost money per-game rather than per-hour. Competitive league pool played on bar tables, however, usually uses international, national or local/regional league rules, and is not what is usually meant by \"bar pool\".

However, 4\u00d78 and even 3\u00d76 examples can sometimes be found. In bars they are almost always coin-operated. Most North American brands of bar tables have pocket proportions opposite those of regular tables in that the side pockets are remarkably tight while the corners are more generous and are therefore considered irregular. Another factor is the cue ball; these tables capture {{gli|object balls}} to minimize replays, but selectively return the cue ball by identifying it mechanically to allow complete games. To do this they employ one of two mechanisms to return a {{gli|scratch|scratched}} cue ball; these are oversized or extra-dense. Because these cue balls do not play as competition cue balls (especially with regard to {{gli|cut shot|cut}} (due to their larger size) and {{gli|stop shot|stop}}/{{gli|draw shot|draw}} shots (due to their larger mass) respectively, they change the characteristics of the cue ball and are therefore deprecated by aficionados. {{gli|smash-through}}). However, modern bar tables make use of a magnetic core with a regulation or near-regulation size and weight paired with a magnet mechanism within the table's {{gli|ball return}} system that separates out the cue ball without requiring cue ball characteristics that affect play.<ref name=\"RGivens\">{{cite book |last=Givens |first=R.

There are three general types of this game:\n* [[eight-ball]], an originally American and now internationally standardized professional version, also subject to competitive team play in numerous leagues. It is the most-played form of competition pool in the world, though not for professionals, among whom [[nine-ball]] dominates.  Uses a set of {{gli|stripes|striped}} and {{gli|solids|solid}} numbered balls.

Uses a set of {{gli|yellows|yellow}} and {{gli|reds|red}} balls. {{gli|Pub pool}} usually consists of minor local variations on one of these two standardised rule sets.\n* \"straight eight\" a.k.a. {{gli|bar pool}}, a widely divergent set of variations on standard eight-ball, and also using the stripes-and-solids ball set.  Usually requires a very strict version of {{gli|called-shot}} play, in which every aspect of a shot must be pre-specified, including {{gli|kiss|kisses}}, {{gli|carom|caroms}}, {{gli|kick|kicks}}, and {{gli|bank|banks}}, with loss of turn resulting from any deviation.

Kept in the dining room, play on such a table was often restricted by the size of the room, so it would be placed so that the head rail would face the connected kitchen door, thus affording a player room for the backswing without hitting a wall.

The lag is most often used in tournament play or other competitions.\nIn hard-break games like [[nine-ball]] and [[eight-ball]] the winner of the lag would normally take the break, while in soft-break games like [[straight pool]] would likely require the loser of the lag to break, since breaking would be a disadvantage.

The holes are spaced slightly closer than the regulation ball width of 2<sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;inch (57.15&nbsp;mm) apart, so that when the balls settle partially into their divots, the outer sides of these indentations create ball-on-ball pressure, pushing the balls together tightly.  The purpose of the template is to do away with using a physical rack, with racking instead being performed simply by placing the balls into position, and the divots aligning them into the tightest possible formation automatically. This prevents accidental loose racks, and also thwarts the possibility of cheating by manipulating the ball positions while racking.

There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as [[English billiards]].\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}\n\n==Definitions and language==\nThe term \"{{gli|billiards}}\" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe labels \"[[British English|British]]\" and \"[[United Kingdom|UK]]\" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the [[British Empire]] and/or are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], as opposed to [[US English|US]] (and, often, [[Canadian English|Canadian]]) terminology.  The terms \"American\" or \"US\" as applied here refer generally to North American usage.  However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.\n\nThe term \"blackball\" is used in this glossary to refer to both [[Blackball (pool)|blackball and eight-ball pool]] as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand.  Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous (\"eight-ball pool\" is too easily confused with the related \"[[eight-ball]]\"), and blackball is globally standardized by an [[International Olympic Committee]]-recognized [[Sports governing body|governing body]], the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American {{gli|bar pool}}, and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets.  (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and [[nine-ball]] draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)\n\nForeign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. {{gli|mass\u00e9|{{lang|fr|mass\u00e9|nocat=y}}}}), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.\n\n==1\u20139{{anchor|1\u20139|!\u20139|!-9|1-9|!\u20139|1\u20139}}==\n{{Glossary}}\n\n{{Term| 1-cushion }}\n<dd> ''See the [[Straight rail billiards]] main article for the game sometimes called \"one-cushion\".'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 1-pocket }}\n<dd> ''See the [[One-pocket]] main article for the game.'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 3-ball }}\n<dd> ''See the [[Three-ball]] main article for the game.<!-- See the {{gli|3 ball|3 ball}} entry, under the \"[[#T|T]]\" section below, for the ball.-->'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 3-cushion }}\n<dd>''See the [[Three-cushion billiards]] main article for the game.'' </dd>\n\n{{Term| 4-ball }}\n<dd> ''See the [[Yotsudama]] main article for the modern Asian game often called \"four-ball\".

However, 4\u00d78 and even 3\u00d76 examples can sometimes be found. In bars they are almost always coin-operated. Most North American brands of bar tables have pocket proportions opposite those of regular tables in that the side pockets are remarkably tight while the corners are more generous and are therefore considered irregular. Another factor is the cue ball; these tables capture {{gli|object balls}} to minimize replays, but selectively return the cue ball by identifying it mechanically to allow complete games. To do this they employ one of two mechanisms to return a {{gli|scratch|scratched}} cue ball; these are oversized or extra-dense. Because these cue balls do not play as competition cue balls (especially with regard to {{gli|cut shot|cut}} (due to their larger size) and {{gli|stop shot|stop}}/{{gli|draw shot|draw}} shots (due to their larger mass) respectively, they change the characteristics of the cue ball and are therefore deprecated by aficionados. {{gli|smash-through}}).

Uses a set of {{gli|yellows|yellow}} and {{gli|reds|red}} balls. {{gli|Pub pool}} usually consists of minor local variations on one of these two standardised rule sets.\n* \"straight eight\" a.k.a. {{gli|bar pool}}, a widely divergent set of variations on standard eight-ball, and also using the stripes-and-solids ball set.  Usually requires a very strict version of {{gli|called-shot}} play, in which every aspect of a shot must be pre-specified, including {{gli|kiss|kisses}}, {{gli|carom|caroms}}, {{gli|kick|kicks}}, and {{gli|bank|banks}}, with loss of turn resulting from any deviation.

Kept in the dining room, play on such a table was often restricted by the size of the room, so it would be placed so that the head rail would face the connected kitchen door, thus affording a player room for the backswing without hitting a wall.

The holes are spaced slightly closer than the regulation ball width of 2<sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;inch (57.15&nbsp;mm) apart, so that when the balls settle partially into their divots, the outer sides of these indentations create ball-on-ball pressure, pushing the balls together tightly.  The purpose of the template is to do away with using a physical rack, with racking instead being performed simply by placing the balls into position, and the divots aligning them into the tightest possible formation automatically. This prevents accidental loose racks, and also thwarts the possibility of cheating by manipulating the ball positions while racking.

Marlborough is a [[unitary authority]], both a region and a district. Marlborough District Council is based at [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], the largest town. The region has a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Marlborough region|y|y|y|(|)}}.\n\nMarlborough is known for its dry climate, the [[Marlborough Sounds]], and [[Sauvignon blanc]] wine. It takes its name from the earlier [[Marlborough Province]], which was named after [[His Grace]] [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|The 1st Duke of Marlborough]], an English general and statesman.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/keyword/blenheim |title=Blenheim |work=New Zealand History |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMarlborough's geography can be roughly divided into four sections. The south and west sections are mountainous, particularly the southern section, which rises to the peaks of the [[Kaikoura Ranges]]. These two mountainous regions are the final northern vestiges of the ranges that make up the [[Southern Alps]], although that name is rarely applied to mountains this far north.\n\nBetween those two sections is the long straight valley of the [[Wairau River]]. This broadens to wide plains at its eastern end, in the centre of which stands the town of [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]. This region has fertile soil and temperate weather, which has enabled it to become the centre of the [[New Zealand wine]] industry.\n\nThe fourth geographic zone lies along its north coast. Here the drowned valleys of the [[Marlborough Sounds]] make for a convoluted and attractive coastline. The town of [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] is located at the southern end of one of the larger sounds, [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]]. The town of [[Havelock, New Zealand|Havelock]] is at the southern end of the Pelorus Sound; this sound feeds into Kenepuru Sound.\n\n{{see also|List of rivers of the Marlborough Region}}\n===Climate===\nIn line with most of New Zealand, the Marlborough region has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb'') with warm summers, cool winters, and rainfall distributed across the year.\n{{Weather box|width=auto|location = Blenheim, 1981\u20132010 normals\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high C = 24.1\n|Feb high C = 23.8\n|Mar high C = 21.9\n|Apr high C = 19.0\n|May high C = 16.0\n|Jun high C = 13.3\n|Jul high C = 12.6\n|Aug high C = 13.8\n|Sep high C = 15.8\n|Oct high C = 18.0\n|Nov high C = 20.0\n|Dec high C = 22.2\n|year high C = 18.4\n|Jan mean C = 18.0\n|Feb mean C = 17.6\n|Mar mean C = 15.8\n|Apr mean C = 13.0\n|May mean C = 10.2\n|Jun mean C = 7.7\n|Jul mean C = 7.0\n|Aug mean C = 8.2\n|Sep mean C = 10.3\n|Oct mean C = 12.2\n|Nov mean C = 14.2\n|Dec mean C = 16.5\n|year mean C = 12.6\n|Jan low C = 11.8\n|Feb low C = 11.5\n|Mar low C = 9.8\n|Apr low C = 6.9\n|May low C = 4.5\n|Jun low C = 2.2\n|Jul low C = 1.5\n|Aug low C = 2.6\n|Sep low C = 4.7\n|Oct low C = 6.5\n|Nov low C = 8.4\n|Dec low C = 10.8\n|year low C = 6.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 48.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 46.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 52.7\n|May precipitation mm = 60.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 70.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 74.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 62.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 65.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 67.4\n|Nov precipitation mm = 55.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 58.1\n|year precipitation mm = 711.0\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.1\n|Mar precipitation days = 5.5\n|Apr precipitation days = 5.3\n|May precipitation days = 6.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 7.9\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.6\n|Aug precipitation days = 8.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 8.5\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.3\n|Nov precipitation days = 6.9\n|Dec precipitation days = 6.7\n|year precipitation days = 81.5\n|Jan humidity = 68.7\n|Feb humidity = 74.2\n|Mar humidity = 74.9\n|Apr humidity = 77.5\n|May humidity = 81.5\n|Jun humidity = 82.3\n|Jul humidity = 83.7\n|Aug humidity = 80.8\n|Sep humidity = 73.3\n|Oct humidity = 72.1\n|Nov humidity = 67.7\n|Dec humidity = 67.5\n|year humidity = 75.4\n|Jan sun = 262.2\n|Feb sun = 223.7\n|Mar sun = 230.8\n|Apr sun = 193.7\n|May sun = 172.7\n|Jun sun = 151.6\n|Jul sun = 157.1\n|Aug sun = 183.9\n|Sep sun = 189.5\n|Oct sun = 226.7\n|Nov sun = 234.7\n|Dec sun = 248.8\n|year sun = 2475.3\n|source 1 = NIWA Climate Data<ref name=\"niwa\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate\n| title = Climate Data and Activities\n| publisher = NIWA \n| accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Demography ==\n[[Statistics New Zealand]] estimates the population at {{NZ population data 2018|Marlborough region|2=y}} as of {{NZ population data 2018|3=y}}.

There are 22 state primary schools, one state intermediate school (Bohally Intermediate in Blenheim), three state secondary schools ([[Marlborough Boys' College]] and [[Marlborough Girls' College]] in Blenheim, and Queen Charlotte College in Picton), and one state area school (Rai Valley Area School). There are two [[State-integrated school|state-integrated schools]], one Catholic primary school and one Christian composite school, both in Blenheim.{{NZ school roll data|4=y}}\n\n== Transport ==\nMarlborough is served by four [[New Zealand state highway network|state highways]]: [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], [[New Zealand State Highway 6|State Highway 6]], [[New Zealand State Highway 62|State Highway 62]], and [[New Zealand State Highway 63|State Highway 63]]. State Highway 1 is the main highway in the region, connecting Picton and Blenheim, and connecting the region south to [[Christchurch]] via Seddon and [[Kaikoura]]. State Highway 6 connects Blenheim and Renwick, and connects the region to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Tasman District|Tasman]] via [[Havelock, New Zealand|Havelock]]. State Highway 63 leaves State Highway 6 at Renwick and travels via the Wairau Valley and [[Saint Arnaud, New Zealand|Saint Arnaud]] to meet SH 6 again at Kawatiri, providing a direct route to the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] and bypassing Nelson. State Highway 62 is a short highway linking SH 1 at Spring Creek with SH 6 north of Renwick, providing a direct route between Picton and Nelson and bypassing Blenheim.\n\nThe [[Main North Line, New Zealand|Main North Line]] railway serves the region, running roughly parallel so State Highway 1. The first section of the line in Marlborough opened on 18 November 1875 between Blenheim and Picton. The line south of Blenheim opened to Seddon in October 1902, to Ward in April 1911, and to [[Wharanui]] in December 1915. The line finally opened across the present-day Marlborough border in October 1942 when the line was extended to [[Clarence, New Zealand|Clarence]]. The entire line through to Christchurch opened on 15 December 1945 when the railheads met at Kaikoura.<ref name=\"NZRmileage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railheritage.org.nz/assets/NZR_MILEAGE_TABLE_1957.pdf|title=Geographical Mileage Table 1957|publisher=New Zealand Railways|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> Today, the line is used by the [[Coastal Pacific]] passenger train, which operates one return journey per day during the summer months. The line is also heavily used by freight trains between Christchurch and the Cook Strait rail ferry at Picton.\n\n[[Woodbourne Airport]] (trading as Marlborough Airport) is the region's main airport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboroughairport.co.nz/|title=Home - Marlborough Airport|website=www.marlboroughairport.co.nz|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> [[Air New Zealand Link]] operates flights from Woodbourne to [[Auckland Airport|Auckland]] and [[Wellington International Airport|Wellington]] and [[Sounds Air]] operates flights from Woodbourne to Wellington and [[Christchurch International Airport|Christchurch Airport]]. Sounds Air also operates flights from [[Picton Aerodrome]] to Wellington. \n\nPort Marlborough at Picton is the region's main seaport. [[Interislander]] and [[StraitNZ|Bluebridge]] both operate roll-on-roll-off ferry services between Picton and Wellington.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|Marlborough}}\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline|Marlborough (New Zealand)|Marlborough}}\n* [http://www.marlborough.govt.nz/ Marlborough District Council]\n* [http://www.marlborough.co.nz/ Discover Marlborough: The Marlborough Web Directory]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041013064104/http://www.marlboroughonline.co.nz/community/ Marlborough Online]\n\n{{coord|41|53|S|173|40|E|region:NZ_type:adm1st|display=title}}\n{{commonscat}}\n\n{{Regions of New Zealand}}\n{{Territorial Authorities of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Marlborough Region| ]]\n[[Category:Territorial authorities of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Wine regions of New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=July 2014}}\n{{short description|Region of New Zealand}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                            = Marlborough\n| native_name                     = Te Tauihu-o-te-waka\n| native_name_lang                = mi\n| settlement_type                 = [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|Territorial authority]]<br/>Region of New Zealand\n| image_skyline                   = Marlborough Sounds From Ferry.jpg\n| image_alt                       = \n| image_caption                   = The Marlborough Sounds seen from the Wellington\u2013Picton ferry\n| image_flag                      = \n| flag_alt                        = \n| image_seal                      = \n| seal_alt                        = \n| image_shield                    = \n| shield_alt                      = \n| nickname                        = \n| motto                           = \n| image_map                       = Marlborough nz location.png\n| map_alt                         = \n| map_caption                     = Location in New Zealand\n| pushpin_map                     = \n| pushpin_label_position          = \n| pushpin_map_alt                 = \n| pushpin_map_caption             = \n| coordinates                     = \n| coordinates_footnotes           = \n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = [[New Zealand]]\n| subdivision_type1               = [[Islands of New Zealand|Island]]\n| subdivision_name2               = [[South Island]]\n| parts_type                      = Wards\n| parts                           = Blenheim<br />Marlborough Sounds<br />Wairau-Awatere\n| established_title1              = District\n| established_date1               = 1989\n| established_title2              = Unitary authority\n| established_date2               = 1992\n| seat_type                       = \n| seat                            = [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]\n| government_footnotes            = \n| leader_part                     = \n| leader_title                    = Mayor\n| leader_name                     = John Leggett\n| leader_title1                   = Deputy Mayor\n| leader_name1                    = Terry Sloan\n| unit_pref                       = Metric\n<!-- ALL fields with measurements have automatic unit conversion -->\n<!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_magnitude                  = <!-- <ref> </re> -->\n| area_total_km2                  = 12,494\n| area_land_km2                   = \n| area_water_km2                  = \n| area_water_percent              = \n| area_urban_km2                  = \n| area_rural_km2                  = \n| area_metro_km2                  = \n| area_rank                       = \n| area_blank1_title               = \n| area_blank2_title               = <!-- square kilometers -->\n| area_note                       = \n| dimensions_footnotes            = \n| length_km                       = \n| width_km                        = \n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = \n| population_total                = {{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Marlborough region|y}}|R}}\n| population_as_of                = {{NZ population data 2018|||y}}\n| population_footnotes            = {{NZ population data 2018||||y}}\n| population_density_km2          = auto\n| population_demonym              = \n| population_note                 = \n| blank_name_sec1                 = [[Human Development Index|HDI]] (2017)\n| blank_info_sec1                 = 0.919<ref name=\"GlobalDataLab\">{{Cite web|url=https://hdi.globaldatalab.org/areadata/shdi/|title=Sub-national HDI -

Marlborough is a [[unitary authority]], both a region and a district. Marlborough District Council is based at [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], the largest town. The region has a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Marlborough region|y|y|y|(|)}}.\n\nMarlborough is known for its dry climate, the [[Marlborough Sounds]], and [[Sauvignon blanc]] wine. It takes its name from the earlier [[Marlborough Province]], which was named after [[His Grace]] [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|The 1st Duke of Marlborough]], an English general and statesman.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/keyword/blenheim |title=Blenheim |work=New Zealand History |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMarlborough's geography can be roughly divided into four sections. The south and west sections are mountainous, particularly the southern section, which rises to the peaks of the [[Kaikoura Ranges]]. These two mountainous regions are the final northern vestiges of the ranges that make up the [[Southern Alps]], although that name is rarely applied to mountains this far north.\n\nBetween those two sections is the long straight valley of the [[Wairau River]]. This broadens to wide plains at its eastern end, in the centre of which stands the town of [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]]. This region has fertile soil and temperate weather, which has enabled it to become the centre of the [[New Zealand wine]] industry.\n\nThe fourth geographic zone lies along its north coast. Here the drowned valleys of the [[Marlborough Sounds]] make for a convoluted and attractive coastline. The town of [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] is located at the southern end of one of the larger sounds, [[Queen Charlotte Sound (New Zealand)|Queen Charlotte Sound]]. The town of [[Havelock, New Zealand|Havelock]] is at the southern end of the Pelorus Sound; this sound feeds into Kenepuru Sound.\n\n{{see also|List of rivers of the Marlborough Region}}\n===Climate===\nIn line with most of New Zealand, the Marlborough region has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb'') with warm summers, cool winters, and rainfall distributed across the year.\n{{Weather box|width=auto|location = Blenheim, 1981\u20132010 normals\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high C = 24.1\n|Feb high C = 23.8\n|Mar high C = 21.9\n|Apr high C = 19.0\n|May high C = 16.0\n|Jun high C = 13.3\n|Jul high C = 12.6\n|Aug high C = 13.8\n|Sep high C = 15.8\n|Oct high C = 18.0\n|Nov high C = 20.0\n|Dec high C = 22.2\n|year high C = 18.4\n|Jan mean C = 18.0\n|Feb mean C = 17.6\n|Mar mean C = 15.8\n|Apr mean C = 13.0\n|May mean C = 10.2\n|Jun mean C = 7.7\n|Jul mean C = 7.0\n|Aug mean C = 8.2\n|Sep mean C = 10.3\n|Oct mean C = 12.2\n|Nov mean C = 14.2\n|Dec mean C = 16.5\n|year mean C = 12.6\n|Jan low C = 11.8\n|Feb low C = 11.5\n|Mar low C = 9.8\n|Apr low C = 6.9\n|May low C = 4.5\n|Jun low C = 2.2\n|Jul low C = 1.5\n|Aug low C = 2.6\n|Sep low C = 4.7\n|Oct low C = 6.5\n|Nov low C = 8.4\n|Dec low C = 10.8\n|year low C = 6.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 48.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 49.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 46.5\n|Apr precipitation mm = 52.7\n|May precipitation mm = 60.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 70.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 74.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 62.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 65.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 67.4\n|Nov precipitation mm = 55.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 58.1\n|year precipitation mm = 711.0\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.0\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.1\n|Mar precipitation days = 5.5\n|Apr precipitation days = 5.3\n|May precipitation days = 6.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 7.9\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.6\n|Aug precipitation days = 8.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 8.5\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.3\n|Nov precipitation days = 6.9\n|Dec precipitation days = 6.7\n|year precipitation days = 81.5\n|Jan humidity = 68.7\n|Feb humidity = 74.2\n|Mar humidity = 74.9\n|Apr humidity = 77.5\n|May humidity = 81.5\n|Jun humidity = 82.3\n|Jul humidity = 83.7\n|Aug humidity = 80.8\n|Sep humidity = 73.3\n|Oct humidity = 72.1\n|Nov humidity = 67.7\n|Dec humidity = 67.5\n|year humidity = 75.4\n|Jan sun = 262.2\n|Feb sun = 223.7\n|Mar sun = 230.8\n|Apr sun = 193.7\n|May sun = 172.7\n|Jun sun = 151.6\n|Jul sun = 157.1\n|Aug sun = 183.9\n|Sep sun = 189.5\n|Oct sun = 226.7\n|Nov sun = 234.7\n|Dec sun = 248.8\n|year sun = 2475.3\n|source 1 = NIWA Climate Data<ref name=\"niwa\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate\n| title = Climate Data and Activities\n| publisher = NIWA \n| accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Demography ==\n[[Statistics New Zealand]] estimates the population at {{NZ population data 2018|Marlborough region|2=y}} as of {{NZ population data 2018|3=y}}.

State Highway 1 is the main highway in the region, connecting Picton and Blenheim, and connecting the region south to [[Christchurch]] via Seddon and [[Kaikoura]]. State Highway 6 connects Blenheim and Renwick, and connects the region to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Tasman District|Tasman]] via [[Havelock, New Zealand|Havelock]]. State Highway 63 leaves State Highway 6 at Renwick and travels via the Wairau Valley and [[Saint Arnaud, New Zealand|Saint Arnaud]] to meet SH 6 again at Kawatiri, providing a direct route to the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] and bypassing Nelson. State Highway 62 is a short highway linking SH 1 at Spring Creek with SH 6 north of Renwick, providing a direct route between Picton and Nelson and bypassing Blenheim.\n\nThe [[Main North Line, New Zealand|Main North Line]] railway serves the region, running roughly parallel so State Highway 1. The first section of the line in Marlborough opened on 18 November 1875 between Blenheim and Picton. The line south of Blenheim opened to Seddon in October 1902, to Ward in April 1911, and to [[Wharanui]] in December 1915. The line finally opened across the present-day Marlborough border in October 1942 when the line was extended to [[Clarence, New Zealand|Clarence]]. The entire line through to Christchurch opened on 15 December 1945 when the railheads met at Kaikoura.<ref name=\"NZRmileage\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railheritage.org.nz/assets/NZR_MILEAGE_TABLE_1957.pdf|title=Geographical Mileage Table 1957|publisher=New Zealand Railways|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> Today, the line is used by the [[Coastal Pacific]] passenger train, which operates one return journey per day during the summer months. The line is also heavily used by freight trains between Christchurch and the Cook Strait rail ferry at Picton.\n\n[[Woodbourne Airport]] (trading as Marlborough Airport) is the region's main airport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marlboroughairport.co.nz/|title=Home - Marlborough Airport|website=www.marlboroughairport.co.nz|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> [[Air New Zealand Link]] operates flights from Woodbourne to [[Auckland Airport|Auckland]] and [[Wellington International Airport|Wellington]] and [[Sounds Air]] operates flights from Woodbourne to Wellington and [[Christchurch International Airport|Christchurch Airport]]. Sounds Air also operates flights from [[Picton Aerodrome]] to Wellington. \n\nPort Marlborough at Picton is the region's main seaport.

{"title_page": "Type (model theory)", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[model theory]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''type''' is an object that describes how a (real or possible) element or finite collection of elements in a [[structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structure]] might behave.  More precisely, it is a set of [[First-order logic|first-order]] formulas in a language ''L'' with free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> that are true of a sequence of elements of an ''L''-structure <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>.  Depending on the context, types can be '''complete''' or '''partial''' and they may use a fixed set of constants, ''A'', from the structure <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>.  The question of which types represent actual elements of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> leads to the ideas of [[saturated model]]s and '''omitting types'''.\n\n==Formal definition==\nConsider a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> for a [[Formal language|language]] ''L''.  Let ''M'' be the [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Domain|universe]] of the structure. For every ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''M'', let ''L''(''A'') be the language obtained from ''L'' by adding a constant ''c''<sub>''a''</sub> for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A''. In other words,\n:<math>L(A) = L \\cup \\{c_a : a \\in A\\}.</math>\n\nA '''1-type (of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>) over''' ''A'' is a set ''p''(''x'') of formulas in ''L''(''A'') with at most one free variable ''x'' (therefore 1-type) such that for every finite subset ''p''<sub>0</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''p''(''x'') there is some ''b''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M'', depending on ''p''<sub>0</sub>(''x''), with <math> \\mathcal{M} \\models p_0(b) </math> (i.e. all formulas in ''p''<sub>0</sub>(''x'') are true in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> when ''x'' is replaced by ''b'').\n\nSimilarly an '''''n''-type (of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>) over''' ''A'' is defined to be a set ''p''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') of formulas in ''L''(''A''), each having its free variables occurring only among the given ''n'' free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, such that for every finite subset ''p''<sub>0</sub>('''''x''''')&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') there are some elements ''b''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,''b''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M'' with <math>\\mathcal{M}\\models p_0(b_1,\\ldots,b_n)</math>.\n\nA '''complete type''' of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> over ''A'' is one that is [[maximal consistent set|maximal]] with respect to inclusion. Equivalently, for every <math>\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in L(A,\\boldsymbol{x})</math> either <math> \\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in p(\\boldsymbol{x})</math>  or  <math>\\lnot\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in p(\\boldsymbol{x})</math>. Any non-complete type is called a '''partial type'''. \nSo, the word '''type''' in general refers to any ''n''-type, partial or complete, over any chosen set of parameters (possibly the empty set).\n\nAn ''n''-type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be {{anchor|realizationOfTypes}}'''realized in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>''' if there is an element '''''b'''''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M''<sup>''n''</sup> such that <math>\\mathcal{M}\\models p(\\boldsymbol{b})</math>. The existence of such a realization is guaranteed for any type by the [[compactness theorem]], although the realization might take place in some [[elementary extension]] of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>, rather than in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> itself. \nIf a complete type is realized by '''''b''''' in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>, then the type is typically denoted <math>tp_n^{\\mathcal{M}}(\\boldsymbol{b}/A)</math> and referred to as '''the complete type of ''b'' over''' ''A''.\n\nA type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be '''isolated by ''<math>\\varphi</math>''''', for <math>\\varphi \\in p(x)</math>, if  <math>\\forall \\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in p(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\operatorname{Th}(\\mathcal M) \\models \\varphi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\rightarrow \\psi(\\boldsymbol{x})</math>. Since finite subsets of a type are always realized in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>, there is always an element '''''b'''''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M''<sup>''n''</sup> such that ''\u03c6''('''''b''''') is true in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>; i.e. <math>\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi(\\boldsymbol{b})</math>, thus '''''b''''' realizes the entire isolated type. So isolated types will be realized in every elementary substructure or extension. Because of this, isolated types can never be omitted (see below).\n\nA model that realizes the maximum possible variety of types is called a [[saturated model]], and the [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] construction provides one way of producing saturated models.\n\n==Examples of types==\nConsider the language with one binary connective, which we denote as <math>\\in</math>. Let <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> be the structure <math>\\langle \\omega, \\in_{\\omega}\\rangle</math> for this language, which is the ordinal <math>\\omega</math> with its standard well-ordering. Let <math>\\mathcal{T}</math> denote the theory of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>.\n\nConsider the set of formulas <math>p(x):=\\{ n\\in_{\\omega} x \\mid n \\in \\omega\\} </math>. First, we claim this is a type. Let <math>p_0(x)\\subseteq p(x)</math> be a finite subset of <math>p(x)</math>. We need to find a <math>b\\in\\omega</math> that satisfies all the formulas in <math>p_0</math>. Well, we can just take the successor of the largest ordinal mentioned in the set of formulas <math>p_0(x)</math>. Then this will clearly contain all the ordinals mentioned in <math>p_0(x)</math>. Thus we have that <math>p(x)</math> is a type. \nNext, note that <math>p(x)</math> is not realized in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>. For, if it were there would be some <math>n\\in\\omega</math> that contains every element of <math>\\omega</math>. \nIf we wanted to realize the type, we might be tempted to consider the model <math>\\langle \\omega+1,\\in_{\\omega+1}\\rangle</math>, which is indeed a supermodel of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> that realizes the type. Unfortunately, this extension is not elementary, that is, this model does not have to satisfy <math>\\mathcal{T}</math>. In particular, the sentence <math>\\exists x \\forall y (y\\in x \\lor y=x)</math> is satisfied by this model and not by <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>.\n\nSo, we wish to realize the type in an elementary extension. We can do this by defining a new structure in the language, which we will denote <math>\\mathcal{M}'</math>. The domain of the structure will be <math>\\omega \\cup \\mathbb{Z}'</math> where <math>\\mathbb{Z}'</math> is the set of integers adorned in such a way that <math>\\mathbb{Z}'\\cap\\omega=\\emptyset</math>. Let <math><</math> denote the usual order of <math>\\mathbb{Z}'</math>. We interpret the symbol <math>\\in</math> in our new structure by <math>\\in_{\\mathcal{M}'} = \\in_{\\omega} \\cup < \\cup \\,(\\omega \\times \\mathbb{Z}')</math>. The idea being that we are adding a \"<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-chain\", or copy of the integers, above all the finite ordinals. Clearly any element of <math>\\mathbb{Z}'</math> realizes the type <math>p(x)</math>. Moreover, one can verify that this extension is elementary.\n\nAnother example: the complete type of the number 2 over the empty set, considered as a member of the natural numbers, would be the set of all first-order statements, describing a variable ''x'', that are true when ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. This set would include formulas such as <math>\\,\\!x\\ne 1+1+1</math>, <math>x\\le 1+1+1+1+1</math>, and <math>\\exists y(y<x)</math>. This is an example of an isolated type, since, working over the theory of the naturals, the formula <math>x = 1+1</math> implies all other formulas that are true about the number 2.\n\nAs a further example, the statements\n\n:<math>\\forall y(y^2<2 \\implies y<x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\forall y((y>0 \\land y^2>2) \\implies y>x)</math>\n\ndescribing the [[square root of 2]] are consistent with the axioms of [[ordered field]]s, and can be extended to a complete type. This type is not realized in the ordered field of rational numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of reals. Similarly, the infinite set of formulas (over the empty set) {x>1, x>1+1, x>1+1+1, ...} is not realized in the ordered field of real numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of [[hyperreals]]. If we allow parameters, for instance all of the reals, we can specify a type <math>\\{ 0 < x < r : r \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math> that is realized by an [[infinitesimal]] hyperreal that violates the [[Archimedean property]].\n\nThe reason it is useful to restrict the parameters to a certain subset of the model is that it helps to distinguish the types that can be satisfied from those that cannot. For example, using the entire set of real numbers as parameters one could generate an uncountably infinite set of formulas like <math>x\\ne 1</math>, <math>x\\ne \\pi</math>, ... that would explicitly rule out every possible real value for ''x'', and therefore could never be realized within the real numbers.\n\n==Stone spaces==\n\nIt is useful to consider the set of complete ''n''-types over ''A'' as a [[topological space]]. Consider the following equivalence relation on formulas in the free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> with parameters in ''A'':\n:<math>\\psi \\equiv \\phi \\Leftrightarrow \\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x_1,\\ldots,x_n (\\psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)).</math>\nOne can show that <math>\\psi \\equiv \\phi</math> if and only if they are contained in exactly the same complete types.\n\nThe set of formulas in free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,''x''<sub>''n''</sub> over ''A'' up to this equivalence relation is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (and is canonically isomorphic to the set of ''A''-definable subsets of ''M''<sup>''n''</sup>). The complete ''n''-types correspond to [[ultrafilter]]s of this Boolean algebra. The set of complete ''n''-types can be made into a topological space by taking the sets of types containing a given formula as basic open sets. This constructs the [[Stone space]], which is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].\n\n'''Example'''. The complete theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 has [[quantifier elimination]], which allows one to show that the possible complete 1-types (over the empty set) correspond to:\n*[[root of a function|Root]]s of a given [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible non-constant polynomial]] over the rationals with leading coefficient 1. For example, the type of square roots of 2. Each of these types is an open point of the Stone space.\n*Transcendental elements, that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial. This type is a point in the Stone space that is closed but not open.\nIn other words, the 1-types correspond exactly to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''] over the rationals '''Q''': if ''r'' is an element of the model of type ''p'', then the ideal corresponding to ''p'' is the set of polynomials with ''r'' as a root (which is only the zero polynomial if ''r'' is transcendental). More generally, the complete ''n''-types correspond to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>n</sub>], in other words to the points of the [[prime spectrum]] of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the [[Zariski topology]] of a [[Boolean ring]] induced in a natural way from the Boolean algebra. While the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if ''q''(''x'',''y'') is an irreducible polynomial in two variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (''x'',''y'') of elements with ''q''(''x'',''y'')=0.\n\n==The omitting types theorem==\n\nGiven a complete ''n''-type ''p'' one can ask if there is a model of the theory that '''omits''' ''p'', in other words there is no ''n''-tuple in the model that realizes ''p''. \nIf ''p'' is an [[isolated point]] in the Stone space, i.e. if {''p''} is an open set, it is easy to see that every model realizes ''p'' (at least if the theory is complete). The '''omitting types theorem''' says that conversely if ''p'' is not isolated then there is a countable model omitting ''p'' (provided that the language is countable).\n\n'''Example''': In the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, there is a 1-type represented by elements that are transcendental over the [[field (mathematics)#Subfields and prime fields|prime field]]. This is a non-isolated point of the Stone space (in fact, the only non-isolated point). The field of algebraic numbers is a model omitting this type, and the algebraic closure of any \n[[transcendental extension]] of the rationals is a model realizing this type.\n\nAll the other types are \"algebraic numbers\" (more precisely, they are the sets of first-order statements satisfied by some given algebraic number), and all such types are realized in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0.\n\n==References==\n* {{ cite book | last=Hodges | first=Wilfrid | authorlink=Wilfrid Hodges | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | title=A shorter model theory | year=1997 | isbn=0-521-58713-1 }}\n* {{ cite book | last=Chang | first=C.C. |author1-link=Chen Chung Chang|author2=Keisler, H.

The existence of such a realization is guaranteed for any type by the [[compactness theorem]], although the realization might take place in some [[elementary extension]] of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>, rather than in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> itself. \nIf a complete type is realized by '''''b''''' in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>, then the type is typically denoted <math>tp_n^{\\mathcal{M}}(\\boldsymbol{b}/A)</math> and referred to as '''the complete type of ''b'' over''' ''A''.\n\nA type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be '''isolated by ''<math>\\varphi</math>''''', for <math>\\varphi \\in p(x)</math>, if  <math>\\forall \\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in p(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\operatorname{Th}(\\mathcal M) \\models \\varphi(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\rightarrow \\psi(\\boldsymbol{x})</math>. Since finite subsets of a type are always realized in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>, there is always an element '''''b'''''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''M''<sup>''n''</sup> such that ''\u03c6''('''''b''''') is true in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>; i.e. <math>\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi(\\boldsymbol{b})</math>, thus '''''b''''' realizes the entire isolated type. So isolated types will be realized in every elementary substructure or extension. Because of this, isolated types can never be omitted (see below).\n\nA model that realizes the maximum possible variety of types is called a [[saturated model]], and the [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] construction provides one way of producing saturated models.\n\n==Examples of types==\nConsider the language with one binary connective, which we denote as <math>\\in</math>. Let <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> be the structure <math>\\langle \\omega, \\in_{\\omega}\\rangle</math> for this language, which is the ordinal <math>\\omega</math> with its standard well-ordering. Let <math>\\mathcal{T}</math> denote the theory of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>.\n\nConsider the set of formulas <math>p(x):=\\{ n\\in_{\\omega} x \\mid n \\in \\omega\\} </math>. First, we claim this is a type. Let <math>p_0(x)\\subseteq p(x)</math> be a finite subset of <math>p(x)</math>. We need to find a <math>b\\in\\omega</math> that satisfies all the formulas in <math>p_0</math>. Well, we can just take the successor of the largest ordinal mentioned in the set of formulas <math>p_0(x)</math>. Then this will clearly contain all the ordinals mentioned in <math>p_0(x)</math>. Thus we have that <math>p(x)</math> is a type. \nNext, note that <math>p(x)</math> is not realized in <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>. For, if it were there would be some <math>n\\in\\omega</math> that contains every element of <math>\\omega</math>. \nIf we wanted to realize the type, we might be tempted to consider the model <math>\\langle \\omega+1,\\in_{\\omega+1}\\rangle</math>, which is indeed a supermodel of <math>\\mathcal{M}</math> that realizes the type. Unfortunately, this extension is not elementary, that is, this model does not have to satisfy <math>\\mathcal{T}</math>. In particular, the sentence <math>\\exists x \\forall y (y\\in x \\lor y=x)</math> is satisfied by this model and not by <math>\\mathcal{M}</math>.\n\nSo, we wish to realize the type in an elementary extension. We can do this by defining a new structure in the language, which we will denote <math>\\mathcal{M}'</math>. The domain of the structure will be <math>\\omega \\cup \\mathbb{Z}'</math> where <math>\\mathbb{Z}'</math> is the set of integers adorned in such a way that <math>\\mathbb{Z}'\\cap\\omega=\\emptyset</math>. Let <math><</math> denote the usual order of <math>\\mathbb{Z}'</math>. We interpret the symbol <math>\\in</math> in our new structure by <math>\\in_{\\mathcal{M}'} = \\in_{\\omega} \\cup < \\cup \\,(\\omega \\times \\mathbb{Z}')</math>. The idea being that we are adding a \"<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-chain\", or copy of the integers, above all the finite ordinals. Clearly any element of <math>\\mathbb{Z}'</math> realizes the type <math>p(x)</math>. Moreover, one can verify that this extension is elementary.\n\nAnother example: the complete type of the number 2 over the empty set, considered as a member of the natural numbers, would be the set of all first-order statements, describing a variable ''x'', that are true when ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. This set would include formulas such as <math>\\,\\!x\\ne 1+1+1</math>, <math>x\\le 1+1+1+1+1</math>, and <math>\\exists y(y<x)</math>. This is an example of an isolated type, since, working over the theory of the naturals, the formula <math>x = 1+1</math> implies all other formulas that are true about the number 2.\n\nAs a further example, the statements\n\n:<math>\\forall y(y^2<2 \\implies y<x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\forall y((y>0 \\land y^2>2) \\implies y>x)</math>\n\ndescribing the [[square root of 2]] are consistent with the axioms of [[ordered field]]s, and can be extended to a complete type. This type is not realized in the ordered field of rational numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of reals. Similarly, the infinite set of formulas (over the empty set) {x>1, x>1+1, x>1+1+1, ...} is not realized in the ordered field of real numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of [[hyperreals]]. If we allow parameters, for instance all of the reals, we can specify a type <math>\\{ 0 < x < r : r \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}</math> that is realized by an [[infinitesimal]] hyperreal that violates the [[Archimedean property]].\n\nThe reason it is useful to restrict the parameters to a certain subset of the model is that it helps to distinguish the types that can be satisfied from those that cannot. For example, using the entire set of real numbers as parameters one could generate an uncountably infinite set of formulas like <math>x\\ne 1</math>, <math>x\\ne \\pi</math>, ... that would explicitly rule out every possible real value for ''x'', and therefore could never be realized within the real numbers.\n\n==Stone spaces==\n\nIt is useful to consider the set of complete ''n''-types over ''A'' as a [[topological space]]. Consider the following equivalence relation on formulas in the free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> with parameters in ''A'':\n:<math>\\psi \\equiv \\phi \\Leftrightarrow \\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x_1,\\ldots,x_n (\\psi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)).</math>\nOne can show that <math>\\psi \\equiv \\phi</math> if and only if they are contained in exactly the same complete types.\n\nThe set of formulas in free variables ''x''<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,''x''<sub>''n''</sub> over ''A'' up to this equivalence relation is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (and is canonically isomorphic to the set of ''A''-definable subsets of ''M''<sup>''n''</sup>). The complete ''n''-types correspond to [[ultrafilter]]s of this Boolean algebra. The set of complete ''n''-types can be made into a topological space by taking the sets of types containing a given formula as basic open sets. This constructs the [[Stone space]], which is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].\n\n'''Example'''. The complete theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 has [[quantifier elimination]], which allows one to show that the possible complete 1-types (over the empty set) correspond to:\n*[[root of a function|Root]]s of a given [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible non-constant polynomial]] over the rationals with leading coefficient 1. For example, the type of square roots of 2. Each of these types is an open point of the Stone space.\n*Transcendental elements, that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial. This type is a point in the Stone space that is closed but not open.\nIn other words, the 1-types correspond exactly to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''] over the rationals '''Q''': if ''r'' is an element of the model of type ''p'', then the ideal corresponding to ''p'' is the set of polynomials with ''r'' as a root (which is only the zero polynomial if ''r'' is transcendental). More generally, the complete ''n''-types correspond to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>n</sub>], in other words to the points of the [[prime spectrum]] of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the [[Zariski topology]] of a [[Boolean ring]] induced in a natural way from the Boolean algebra. While the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if ''q''(''x'',''y'') is an irreducible polynomial in two variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (''x'',''y'') of elements with ''q''(''x'',''y'')=0.\n\n==The omitting types theorem==\n\nGiven a complete ''n''-type ''p'' one can ask if there is a model of the theory that '''omits''' ''p'', in other words there is no ''n''-tuple in the model that realizes ''p''. \nIf ''p'' is an [[isolated point]] in the Stone space, i.e. if {''p''} is an open set, it is easy to see that every model realizes ''p'' (at least if the theory is complete). The '''omitting types theorem''' says that conversely if ''p'' is not isolated then there is a countable model omitting ''p'' (provided that the language is countable).\n\n'''Example''': In the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, there is a 1-type represented by elements that are transcendental over the [[field (mathematics)#Subfields and prime fields|prime field]]. This is a non-isolated point of the Stone space (in fact, the only non-isolated point). The field of algebraic numbers is a model omitting this type, and the algebraic closure of any \n[[transcendental extension]] of the rationals is a model realizing this type.\n\nAll the other types are \"algebraic numbers\" (more precisely, they are the sets of first-order statements satisfied by some given algebraic number), and all such types are realized in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0.\n\n==References==\n* {{ cite book | last=Hodges | first=Wilfrid | authorlink=Wilfrid Hodges | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | title=A shorter model theory | year=1997 | isbn=0-521-58713-1 }}\n* {{ cite book | last=Chang | first=C.C. |author1-link=Chen Chung Chang|author2=Keisler, H.

The provincial governments of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba are required to provide services in French where justified by the number of francophones (those whose mother tongue is French or who use French on a daily basis). French is also an official language of all three territories. However, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] requires all provinces and territories to provide primary and secondary education to their official-language minorities.\n\n==The evolution of the French language in Canada==\n\n===16th century ===\n\nIn 1524, the Florentine navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], working for Italian bankers in France, explored the American coast from [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]]. In 1529, Verrazzano mapped a part of the coastal region of the North American continent under the name Nova Gallia ([[New France]]). In 1534, King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] of France sent [[Jacques Cartier]] to discover new lands. Cartier discovered the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], sealed an alliance with the local people and obtained passage to go farther. During his second expedition (1535\u20131536), Cartier discovered the [[Saint Lawrence River]], a path into the heart of the continent. However, Cartier failed to establish a permanent colony in the area, and war in Europe kept France from further colonization through the end of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\">Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 2, p. 57</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 5, p. 23</ref>\n\n===17th century===\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, French settlements and private companies were established in the area that is now eastern Canada. In 1605, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] ([[Acadia]]), and in 1608 he founded [[Quebec City]]. In 1642, the foundation of Ville Marie, the settlement that would eventually become [[Montreal]], completed the occupation of the territory.\n\nIn 1634, Quebec contained 200 settlers who were principally involved in the fur trade. The trade was profit-making and the city was on the point of becoming more than a mere temporary trading post.\n\nIn 1635, [[Jesuits]] founded the secondary school of Quebec for the education of children. In 1645, the Compagnie des Habitants was created, uniting the political and economic leaders of the colony. [[French language|French]] was the language of all the non-native people.\n\nIn 1685, the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] (1654\u20131715), which had legalized freedom of religion of the [[Reformed Church]], caused the emigration from France of 300,000 [[Huguenots]] (French Calvinists) to other countries of Europe and to North America.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 837-838</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n\nWith the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the British began their domination of eastern North America, some parts of which had been controlled by the French. The British took mainland [[Nova Scotia]] in 1713. Present-day [[Maine]] fell to the British during [[Father Rale's War]], while present-day [[New Brunswick]] fell after [[Father Le Loutre's War]]. In 1755 the majority of the French-speaking inhabitants of Nova Scotia were deported to the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. After 1758, they were deported to England and France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] completed the British takeover, removing France from Canadian territory, except for [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] at the entrance of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nThe French language was relegated to second rank as far as trade and state communications were concerned. Out of necessity, the educated class learned the [[English language]] and became progressively bilingual, but the great majority of the French-speaking inhabitants continued to speak only French, and their population increased. Anglicization of the French population failed, and it became obvious that coexistence was required. In 1774, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Quebec Act]], restoring French civil laws and abrogating the [[Test Act]], which had been used to suppress Catholicism.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 838-839</ref>\n\n===Canada as a federal state===\n\nIn 1791, Parliament repealed the Quebec Act and gave the king authority to divide the Canadian colony into two new provinces: [[Upper Canada]], which later became Ontario, and [[Lower Canada]], which became Quebec.\n \nIn 1867, three colonies of British North America agreed to form a federal state, which was named [[Canada]]. It was composed of four provinces: \n* [[Ontario]], formerly Upper Canada\n* [[Quebec]], formerly Lower Canada\n* [[Nova Scotia]]\n* [[New Brunswick]], former Acadian territory\n\nIn Quebec, French became again the official language; until then it was the [[vernacular language]] but with no legal status.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 19, pp. 397-404</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bourhis |first1=Richard Y. |last2=Lepicq |first2=Dominique |date=1993 |chapter=Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French and language issues in Qu\u00e9bec |title=Trends in Romance Linguistics and Philology. |volume=Volume 5: Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance |editor-first1=Rebecca |editor-last1=Posner |editor-first2=John N. |editor-last2=Green |publisher=Mouton De Gruyter |location=New York |isbn=311011724X}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical use of the term \"Canadian French\" ===\nThe term \"Canadian French\" was formerly used to refer specifically to Quebec French and to the closely related varieties of Ontario and Western Canada that descended from it.<ref>Francard and Latin, in ''Le r\u00e9gionalisme lexical'', write:\n: \"Le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec a rayonn\u00e9 en Ontario et dans l'ouest du Canada, de m\u00eame qu'en Nouvelle-Angleterre. [...] Le fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et le fran\u00e7ais acadien peuvent \u00eatre regroup\u00e9s sous l'appellation plus large de ''fran\u00e7ais canadien''<sup>2</sup>, laquelle englobe aussi le fran\u00e7ais ontarien et le fran\u00e7ais de l'Ouest canadien. Ces deux derniers poss\u00e8dent des traits caract\u00e9ristiques qui leur sont propres aujourd'hui dans l'ensemble canadien et qui s'expliquent surtout par un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de conservatisme, mais il s'agit de vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui sont historiquement des prolongements du fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n: <sup>2</sup>Il faut noter ici que le terme de \"fran\u00e7ais canadien\" avait autrefois un sens plus restreint, d\u00e9signant le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec et les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui s'y rattachent directement, d'o\u00f9 l'emploi \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de \"canadianisme\" pour parler d'un trait caract\u00e9ristique du fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec.\"</ref> This is presumably because Canada and Acadia were distinct parts of New France, and also of British North America, until 1867. However, today the term Canadian French is not usually deemed to exclude Acadian French.\n\n[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetically]], Quebec French, M\u00e9tis French and [[Brayon]] French are representatives of [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French in the Americas, whereas Acadian French, Cajun French and Newfoundland French are derivatives of non-koinesized local dialects in France.<ref>Robert Fournier & Henri Wittmann. 1995. ''Le fran\u00e7ais des Am\u00e9riques''. Trois-Rivi\u00e8res: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.</ref>\n\n==French dialects==\nAs a consequence of geographical seclusion and as a result of British conquest, the French language in Canada presents three different but related main dialects. They share certain features that distinguish them from European French. The name ''Canadian French'' has been used as an umbrella term for all of these varieties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll of these dialects mix, to varying degrees, elements from regional languages and folk dialects spoken in France at the time of colonization. For instance, the origins of Quebec French lie in 17th- and 18th-century Parisian French, influenced by folk dialects of the early [[French language|modern period]] and other [[O\u00efl languages|regional languages]] (such as [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]]-[[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]) that French colonists had brought to [[New France]]. It has been asserted that the influence of these dialects has been stronger on Acadian French than on French spoken in Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The three dialects can also be historically and geographically associated with three of the five former colonies of [[New France]]: [[Canada, New France|Canada]], [[Acadia]] and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Terre-Neuve (Newfoundland)]].\n\nIn addition, there is a [[mixed language]] known as [[Michif language|Michif]], which is based on [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[French language|French]]. It is spoken by [[M\u00e9tis]] communities in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] as well as within adjacent areas of the United States.\n\nImmigration after World War II has brought francophone immigrants from around the world, and with them other [[French dialects]].\n\n=== Varieties ===\n''[[Quebec French]]'' is spoken in [[Quebec]]. Closely related varieties are spoken by francophone communities in [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada]], [[Labrador]] and in the [[New England]] region of the United States, and they differ from Quebec French primarily by their greater conservatism. The term ''Laurentian French'' has limited application as a collective label for all these varieties, and ''Quebec French'' has also been used for the entire dialect group. The overwhelming majority of [[francophone]] Canadians speak this dialect.\n\n''[[Acadian French]]'' is spoken by over 350,000 [[Acadians]] in parts of the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Magdalen Islands]] and the [[Gasp\u00e9 peninsula]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CA Ethnologue report for Canada]</ref>\n\n''[[M\u00e9tis French]]'' is spoken in [[Manitoba]] and [[Western Canada]] by the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], descendants of [[First Nations]] mothers and [[Voyageurs|voyageur]] fathers during the era of [[fur trade]]. Many M\u00e9tis spoke Cree in addition to French, and over the years they developed a unique mixed language called Michif by combining M\u00e9tis French nouns, numerals, articles and adjectives with Cree verbs, demonstratives, postpositions, interrogatives and pronouns. Both the Michif language and the M\u00e9tis dialect of French are [[Language death|severely endangered]].\n\n''[[Newfoundland French]]'' is spoken by a small population on the [[Port au Port Peninsula|Port-au-Port Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It is endangered; Quebec French and Acadian French are now more widely spoken among Newfoundland francophones than the distinctive peninsular dialect.\n\n''[[Brayon|Brayon French]]'' is spoken in the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] of Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick and Madawaska, Maine. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is [[morphosyntactic]]ally identical to Quebec French.<ref>Geddes, James (1908).

Essentially a local variant of Quebec French, it is one of three major forms of French that developed in what is now the U.S., the others being [[Louisiana French]] and the nearly extinct [[Missouri French]]. It is endangered, though its use has been supported by bilingual education programs since 1987.<ref name=\"Ammon\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=0-89925-356-3|pages=306\u2013308|author2=International Sociological Association|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sub-varieties ====\nTwo main sub-varieties of Canadian French have been identified. ''[[Joual]]'' is an informal variety of French spoken in working-class neighbourhoods in the province of Quebec. ''[[Chiac]]'' is a blending of Acadian French syntax and vocabulary with numerous lexical borrowings from English.\n\n==Francophones across Canada==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"font-size:92%; margin:auto;\"\n|+Number of francophones by province and territory in Canada (2012)\n|-\n!

Today, 81.4 per cent of Quebecers are first language francophones.<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\">[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/lang/provs.cfm Profile of languages in Canada: Provinces and territories<!-- Bot generated title -->]. Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref> About 95 per cent of Quebecers speak French.<ref name=statcan2016qc /> However, many of the services the provincial government provides are available in English for the sizeable [[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]] population of the province (notably in [[Montreal]]). For native French speakers, [[Quebec French]] is noticeably different in pronunciation and vocabulary from the [[French language|French]] of [[France]], sometimes called ''Metropolitan French'', but they are easily mutually intelligible in their formal varieties, and after moderate exposure, in most of their informal ones as well. The differences are primarily due to changes that have occurred in Quebec French and [[Parisian French]] since the 18th century, when Britain gained possession of Canada.\n\nDifferent regions of Quebec have their own varieties: [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], [[C\u00f4te-Nord]], [[Quebec City]], [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]], [[Outaouais (region)|Outaouais]], and [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] have differences in pronunciation as well as in vocabulary. For example, depending on one's region, the ordinary word for \"kettle\" can be {{lang|fr|bouilloire, bombe,}} or {{lang|fr|canard}}.\n\nIn Quebec, the French language is of paramount importance. For example, the [[stop sign]]s on the roads are written {{lang|fr|ARR\u00caT}} (which has the literal meaning of \"stop\" in French), even if other French-speaking countries, like [[France]], use ''STOP''. On a similar note, movies originally made in other languages than French (mostly movies originally made in English) are more literally named in Quebec than they are in France (e.g. The movie ''[[The Love Guru]]'' is called {{lang|fr|Love Gourou}} in France, but in Quebec it is called {{lang|fr|Le Gourou de l'amour}}). Also, [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] do not always use the same words as the French. Here are some examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! English !! Quebec French !! Metropolitan French\n|-\n| weekend || fin de semaine || week-end\n|-\n| parking lot || stationnement || parking \n|-\n| e-mail || courriel || mail/courriel\n|-\n| spam || pourriel || spam\n|-\n| online chat || clavardage || chat/tchat\n|-\n| beverage || breuvage/boisson || boisson\n|-\n| [[lunch]] || d\u00eener || d\u00e9jeuner\n|-\n| [[dinner]] || souper || d\u00eener\n|-\n| washing machine || laveuse || machine \u00e0 laver \n|-\n| clothes dryer || s\u00e9cheuse || s\u00e8che-linge\n|}\n\n====Use of anglicisms====\nThe term [[anglicism]] ({{lang|fr|Anglicisme}}) is related to the linguistic concepts of [[loanwords]], [[Barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]], [[diglossia]] or the [[macaronic]] mixture of the French (fran\u00e7ais) and English (anglais) languages\n\nAccording to some, French spoken in Canada includes many anglicisms. The [[Quebec Office of the French Language]]'s \"{{lang|fr|Banque de d\u00e9pannage linguistique}}\" (Language Troubleshooting Database)<ref>http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/</ref> distinguishes between different kinds of anglicisms:<ref>{{cite web|last=Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise|title=Anglicismes|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/francilettre/francilettreEX_20070914.html |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n* The entire anglicisms are words or groups of [[loan words]] from the English Language. The form is often exactly the same as in English, e.g. : \"glamour\", \"short\" and \"sweet\", but sometimes there is a slight adjustment to the French language, e.g.: \"{{lang|fr|drabe}}\", which comes from the English word \"drab\".\n* The hybrid anglicisms, which are new words, a combination of an English word to which a French element is added. This element (a suffix, for instance) sometimes replaces a similar element of the English word. \"{{lang|fr|Booster}}\" is an example of hybrid anglicism: it is made up of the English verb \"to boost\", to which the French suffix  \u2013er is added.\n* Plenty of anglicisms are semantic anglicisms: they are French words used in a sense which exists in English, but not in French. {{lang|fr|Ajourner}} (\"postpone\") in the sense of \"to have a break\", {{lang|fr|path\u00e9tique}} in the sense of \"miserable\" or \"pitiful\", {{lang|fr|plancher}} (\"floor/surface\") in the sense of \"floor\" (level of a building) and {{lang|fr|pr\u00e9judice}} (\"harm/injury\") in the sense of \"(unfavorable) opinion\".\n* The syntactic anglicisms are those relating to the word order of a sentence and the use of prepositions and conjunctions. The expression \"{{lang|fr|un bon dix minutes}}\" (\"a good ten minutes\"), for instance, comes from the English language; the more conventional French wording would be \"{{lang|fr|dix bonnes minutes}}\". The use of the preposition {{lang|fr|pour}} (\"for\") after the verbs {{lang|fr|demander}} (\"ask [for]\") and {{lang|fr|chercher}} (\"search/look [for]\") is also a syntactic anglicism.\n* The morphological anglicisms are literal translations (or {{lang|fr|[[calques]]}}) of the English forms. With this kind of loan words, every element comes from the French language, but what results from it as a whole reproduces, completely or partly, the image transmitted in English. The word {{lang|fr|technicalit\u00e9}}, for instance, is formed under English influence and does not exist in standard French (which would instead use the phrasing \"{{lang|fr|d\u00e9tail technique}}\"). {{lang|fr|\u00c0 l'ann\u00e9e longue}} (\"all year long\"), {{lang|fr|appel conf\u00e9rence}} (\"conference call\") and {{lang|fr|prix de liste}} (\"list price\") are other morphological examples of anglicisms.\n* Finally, the sentencial anglicisms are loan set phrases or images peculiar to the English language. The expressions {{lang|fr|ajouter l'insulte \u00e0 l'injure}} (\"add insult to injury\") and {{lang|fr|sonner une cloche}} (\"ring a bell\") are sentencial anglicisms. [[Loi 101|Law 101]] could postpone the advance of the phenomenon or even prevent it.\n\nAcademic, colloquial and pejorative terms are used in Canada (such as {{lang|fr|des \"sabirisation\"}} (from {{lang|fr|sabir}}, \"[[pidgin]]\"), [[Franglais]], [[Fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], [[Canadian French]]) to refer to the vernacular.\n\n====Syntactic and semantic characteristics====\n\nIn general, the same norms as in common French are applied. Only certain words have a different gender. Notable from a semantic point of view are the use of the word \"pis\" for the conjunction \"and\", where \"et\" would be used in Metropolitan French; the word \"l\u00e0\" to punctuate the end of a sentence or after a word; and the use of \"\u00e0\" instead of the possessive \"de\", for instance, \"la maison \u00e0 Jacques\" for \"Jacques's house\".\n\n====Use of the ''tu'' form====\nFrench is a language with a [[T\u2013V distinction]], where different pronouns are used for polite and familiar address. Quebecers use the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} form more than other dialects. This use is often qualified as the imitation of the English-speaking use of ''you'', which is the only pronoun referring to the second person, but only in spoken language.\n\n===Atlantic Canada===\n\n[[File:The Acadians.png|thumb|left|150px|Present-day Acadian communities]]\n\n====Historical review====\nThe colonists living in what are now the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] were principally constituted of [[Bretons]], [[Normans]], and [[Basques]]. Conquered by the English, they suffered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|massive deportations]] to the [[United States]] and [[France]]. Others went into exile to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] or to nearby islands. Those who stayed were persecuted. At the end of the 18th century, more liberal measures granted new lands to those who had stayed, and measures were taken to promote the return of numerous exiled people from Canada and [[Miquelon]]. The number of Acadians rose rapidly, to the point of gaining representation in the [[Legislative Assembly]].\n\nFrench is one of the official languages, with English, of the province of [[New Brunswick]]. Apart from [[Quebec]], this is the only other Canadian province that recognizes French as an official language. Approximately one-third of New Brunswickers are francophone,<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\"/> by far the largest [[Acadian]] population in Canada.\n\nThe Acadian community is concentrated in primarily rural areas along the border with Quebec and the eastern coast of the province. Francophones in the [[Madawaska County, New Brunswick|Madawaska]] area may also be identified as [[Brayon]], although sociologists have disputed whether the Brayons represent a distinct francophone community, a subgroup of the Acadians or an extraprovincial community of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.  The only major Acadian population centre is [[Moncton]], home to the main campus of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Moncton]]. Francophones are, however, in the minority in Moncton.\n\nIn addition to New Brunswick, Acadian French has speakers in portions of mainland Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In these provinces, the percentage of francophones is much smaller than in New Brunswick. In some communities, French is an [[endangered language]].\n\n====Origins of the dialect====\n\nLinguists do not agree about the origin of [[Acadian French]]. [[Acadian French]] is influenced by the ''[[langues d'o\u00efl]]''. The dialect contains, among other features, the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] ''r'' and the pronunciation of the final syllable in the plural form of the verb in the third person. Acadia is the only place outside [[Jersey]] (a [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] close to mainland Normandy) where [[J\u00e8rriais]] speakers can be found.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus A-C, p. 24</ref>\n\n====Some characteristics====\nThe variety of French spoken in [[Atlantic Canada]] possesses features that differ from [[Quebec French]].\n\nAccording to Wiesmath (2006),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le fran\u00e7ais acadien: analyse syntaxique d'un corpus oral recueilli au Nouveau-Brunswick, Canada|last=Wiesmath|first=Rapha\u00eble|publisher=l'Hamalthan|year=2006}}[https://archive.org/details/lefrancaisacadie0000wies]. ''Accessed 5 May 2011''.</ref> some characteristics of Acadian are:\n*The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural\n*Palatalization of {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} and {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}, respectively\n*A featured called \"l'ouisme\" where ''bonne'' is pronounced {{IPA|[bun]}}\nThese features typically occur in older speech.\n\nYves Cormier's ''Dictionnaire du fran\u00e7ais acadien'' (ComiersAcad)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Cormier|first=Yves|title=Dictionnaire du fran\u00e7ais acadien|year=2009|publisher=Fides, Editions}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref> includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of ''je'' both for the first person singular and for the third plural; the same phenomenon takes place with ''i'' for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the ''vous'' form from the ''tu'' form.\n\nHowever, because of contact with francophones from other parts of Canada, the distinctive characteristics of Acadian French have been progressively weakened.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Valdman|first=Albert|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|year=1997|publisher=Premium Press|location=New-York}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn addition, English has influenced Acadian French through the borrowing of words, many of which used to be French words used in the English language.\n\n===Ontario===\n\nAlthough French is the native language of just over half a million Canadians in [[Ontario]], francophone Ontarians represent only 4.4 per cent of the province's population. They are concentrated primarily in the [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]] regions, near the border with [[Quebec]], although they are also present in smaller numbers throughout the province. Forty per cent of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s no longer speak the language at home. However, [[Ottawa]] is the city which counts the biggest number of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s. The Franco-Ontarians are originally from a first wave of immigration from [[France]], from a second wave from Quebec. The third wave comes from Quebec, but also from Haiti, Morocco, Africa, etc.\n\nThe province has no official language defined in law, although it is a largely English-speaking province. Ontario law requires that the provincial [[Legislative Assembly]] operate in both English and French (individuals can speak in the Assembly in the official language of their choice), and requires that all provincial statutes and bills be made available in both English and French. Furthermore, under the [[French Language Services Act]], individuals are entitled to communicate with the head or central office of any provincial government department or agency in French, as well as to receive all government services in French in 25 designated areas in the province, selected according to minority population criteria. The provincial government of Ontario's website is bilingual. Residents of [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Timmins]] can receive services from their municipal government in the official language of their choice.\n\nThere are also several French-speaking communities on military bases in Ontario, such as the one at [[CFB Trenton]]. These communities have been founded by francophone Canadians in the [[Canadian Forces]] who live together in military residences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Statistiques Canada|title=Population dont le fran\u00e7ais est la langue parl\u00e9e le plus souvent \u00e0 la maison, Canada, Provinces, territoires et Canada moins le Qu\u00e9bec, 1996 \u00e0 2006 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ |accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=David Block |title=Globalization and language teaching |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |author2=Heller Monica}}</ref>\n\n====Franco-Ontarian====\n\nThe term [[Franco-Ontarian]] accepts two interpretations. According to the first one, it includes all French speakers of Ontario, wherever they come from. According to second one, it includes all French Canadians born in Ontario, whatever their level of French is.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus K-M, p. 2638</ref>\n\nThe modern Franco-Ontarian language is close to Quebec French with some rare exceptions of expressions and pronunciations. Once again, the influence of English can be noted, with a big recourse to tonic stresses, but nevertheless a French vocabulary is still used. According to Michel Laurier (1989),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le subjonctif dans le parler franco-ontarien : un mode en voie de disparition ?|last=Laurier|first=Michel|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Carleton|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUzqrzHNwP0C&pg=PA105|page=105}}</ref> the semantic and stylistic value of the use of the subjunctive is progressively disappearing.

[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was annexed by [[England]] in 1583. It is the first British possession in [[North America]].\n\nIn 1610, the Frenchmen became established in the [[peninsula of Avalon]] and went to war against the Englishmen. In 1713, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] acknowledged the sovereignty of the Englishmen.\n\nThe origin of [[Franco-Newfoundlanders]] is double: the first ones to arrive are especially of [[Breton people|Breton]] origin, attracted by the fishing possibilities. Then, from the 19th century, the Acadians who came from the [[Cape Breton Island]] and from the [[Magdalen Islands]], an archipelago of nine small islands belonging to Quebec, become established.\n\nUp to the middle of the 20th century, Breton fishers, who had Breton as their mother tongue, but who had been educated in French came to settle. This Breton presence can explain differences between the Newfoundland French and the [[Acadian French]].\n\nIn the 1970s, the French language appears in the school of Cape St. George in the form of a bilingual education. In the 1980s, classes of French for native French speakers are organized there.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\" /><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref>\n\n====Characteristics of French of Newfoundland====\nAccording to Patrice Brasseur's articles \" Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port \" (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brasseur|first=Patrice|title=Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port|journal=Glottopol, Revue de sociolinguistique en ligne|volume=9|pages=66\u201379}}[https://scholar.google.com/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624020514/https://scholar.google.com/|date=24 June 2011}}.

The provincial government of [[Manitoba]] boasts the only bilingual website of the Prairies; the Canadian constitution makes French an official language in Manitoba for the legislature and courts.

The provincial governments of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba are required to provide services in French where justified by the number of francophones (those whose mother tongue is French or who use French on a daily basis). French is also an official language of all three territories. However, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] requires all provinces and territories to provide primary and secondary education to their official-language minorities.\n\n==The evolution of the French language in Canada==\n\n===16th century ===\n\nIn 1524, the Florentine navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], working for Italian bankers in France, explored the American coast from [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]]. In 1529, Verrazzano mapped a part of the coastal region of the North American continent under the name Nova Gallia ([[New France]]). In 1534, King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] of France sent [[Jacques Cartier]] to discover new lands. Cartier discovered the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], sealed an alliance with the local people and obtained passage to go farther. During his second expedition (1535\u20131536), Cartier discovered the [[Saint Lawrence River]], a path into the heart of the continent. However, Cartier failed to establish a permanent colony in the area, and war in Europe kept France from further colonization through the end of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\">Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 2, p. 57</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 5, p. 23</ref>\n\n===17th century===\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, French settlements and private companies were established in the area that is now eastern Canada. In 1605, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] ([[Acadia]]), and in 1608 he founded [[Quebec City]]. In 1642, the foundation of Ville Marie, the settlement that would eventually become [[Montreal]], completed the occupation of the territory.\n\nIn 1634, Quebec contained 200 settlers who were principally involved in the fur trade. The trade was profit-making and the city was on the point of becoming more than a mere temporary trading post.\n\nIn 1635, [[Jesuits]] founded the secondary school of Quebec for the education of children. In 1645, the Compagnie des Habitants was created, uniting the political and economic leaders of the colony. [[French language|French]] was the language of all the non-native people.\n\nIn 1685, the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] (1654\u20131715), which had legalized freedom of religion of the [[Reformed Church]], caused the emigration from France of 300,000 [[Huguenots]] (French Calvinists) to other countries of Europe and to North America.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 837-838</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n\nWith the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the British began their domination of eastern North America, some parts of which had been controlled by the French. The British took mainland [[Nova Scotia]] in 1713. Present-day [[Maine]] fell to the British during [[Father Rale's War]], while present-day [[New Brunswick]] fell after [[Father Le Loutre's War]]. In 1755 the majority of the French-speaking inhabitants of Nova Scotia were deported to the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. After 1758, they were deported to England and France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] completed the British takeover, removing France from Canadian territory, except for [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] at the entrance of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nThe French language was relegated to second rank as far as trade and state communications were concerned. Out of necessity, the educated class learned the [[English language]] and became progressively bilingual, but the great majority of the French-speaking inhabitants continued to speak only French, and their population increased. Anglicization of the French population failed, and it became obvious that coexistence was required. In 1774, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Quebec Act]], restoring French civil laws and abrogating the [[Test Act]], which had been used to suppress Catholicism.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 838-839</ref>\n\n===Canada as a federal state===\n\nIn 1791, Parliament repealed the Quebec Act and gave the king authority to divide the Canadian colony into two new provinces: [[Upper Canada]], which later became Ontario, and [[Lower Canada]], which became Quebec.\n \nIn 1867, three colonies of British North America agreed to form a federal state, which was named [[Canada]]. It was composed of four provinces: \n* [[Ontario]], formerly Upper Canada\n* [[Quebec]], formerly Lower Canada\n* [[Nova Scotia]]\n* [[New Brunswick]], former Acadian territory\n\nIn Quebec, French became again the official language; until then it was the [[vernacular language]] but with no legal status.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 19, pp. 397-404</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bourhis |first1=Richard Y. |last2=Lepicq |first2=Dominique |date=1993 |chapter=Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French and language issues in Qu\u00e9bec |title=Trends in Romance Linguistics and Philology. |volume=Volume 5: Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance |editor-first1=Rebecca |editor-last1=Posner |editor-first2=John N. |editor-last2=Green |publisher=Mouton De Gruyter |location=New York |isbn=311011724X}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical use of the term \"Canadian French\" ===\nThe term \"Canadian French\" was formerly used to refer specifically to Quebec French and to the closely related varieties of Ontario and Western Canada that descended from it.<ref>Francard and Latin, in ''Le r\u00e9gionalisme lexical'', write:\n: \"Le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec a rayonn\u00e9 en Ontario et dans l'ouest du Canada, de m\u00eame qu'en Nouvelle-Angleterre.

Ces deux derniers poss\u00e8dent des traits caract\u00e9ristiques qui leur sont propres aujourd'hui dans l'ensemble canadien et qui s'expliquent surtout par un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de conservatisme, mais il s'agit de vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui sont historiquement des prolongements du fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n: <sup>2</sup>Il faut noter ici que le terme de \"fran\u00e7ais canadien\" avait autrefois un sens plus restreint, d\u00e9signant le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec et les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui s'y rattachent directement, d'o\u00f9 l'emploi \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de \"canadianisme\" pour parler d'un trait caract\u00e9ristique du fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec.\"</ref> This is presumably because Canada and Acadia were distinct parts of New France, and also of British North America, until 1867. However, today the term Canadian French is not usually deemed to exclude Acadian French.\n\n[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetically]], Quebec French, M\u00e9tis French and [[Brayon]] French are representatives of [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French in the Americas, whereas Acadian French, Cajun French and Newfoundland French are derivatives of non-koinesized local dialects in France.<ref>Robert Fournier & Henri Wittmann. 1995.

Trois-Rivi\u00e8res: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.</ref>\n\n==French dialects==\nAs a consequence of geographical seclusion and as a result of British conquest, the French language in Canada presents three different but related main dialects. They share certain features that distinguish them from European French. The name ''Canadian French'' has been used as an umbrella term for all of these varieties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll of these dialects mix, to varying degrees, elements from regional languages and folk dialects spoken in France at the time of colonization. For instance, the origins of Quebec French lie in 17th- and 18th-century Parisian French, influenced by folk dialects of the early [[French language|modern period]] and other [[O\u00efl languages|regional languages]] (such as [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]]-[[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]) that French colonists had brought to [[New France]]. It has been asserted that the influence of these dialects has been stronger on Acadian French than on French spoken in Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The three dialects can also be historically and geographically associated with three of the five former colonies of [[New France]]: [[Canada, New France|Canada]], [[Acadia]] and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Terre-Neuve (Newfoundland)]].\n\nIn addition, there is a [[mixed language]] known as [[Michif language|Michif]], which is based on [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[French language|French]]. It is spoken by [[M\u00e9tis]] communities in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] as well as within adjacent areas of the United States.\n\nImmigration after World War II has brought francophone immigrants from around the world, and with them other [[French dialects]].\n\n=== Varieties ===\n''[[Quebec French]]'' is spoken in [[Quebec]]. Closely related varieties are spoken by francophone communities in [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada]], [[Labrador]] and in the [[New England]] region of the United States, and they differ from Quebec French primarily by their greater conservatism. The term ''Laurentian French'' has limited application as a collective label for all these varieties, and ''Quebec French'' has also been used for the entire dialect group. The overwhelming majority of [[francophone]] Canadians speak this dialect.\n\n''[[Acadian French]]'' is spoken by over 350,000 [[Acadians]] in parts of the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Magdalen Islands]] and the [[Gasp\u00e9 peninsula]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CA Ethnologue report for Canada]</ref>\n\n''[[M\u00e9tis French]]'' is spoken in [[Manitoba]] and [[Western Canada]] by the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], descendants of [[First Nations]] mothers and [[Voyageurs|voyageur]] fathers during the era of [[fur trade]]. Many M\u00e9tis spoke Cree in addition to French, and over the years they developed a unique mixed language called Michif by combining M\u00e9tis French nouns, numerals, articles and adjectives with Cree verbs, demonstratives, postpositions, interrogatives and pronouns. Both the Michif language and the M\u00e9tis dialect of French are [[Language death|severely endangered]].\n\n''[[Newfoundland French]]'' is spoken by a small population on the [[Port au Port Peninsula|Port-au-Port Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It is endangered; Quebec French and Acadian French are now more widely spoken among Newfoundland francophones than the distinctive peninsular dialect.\n\n''[[Brayon|Brayon French]]'' is spoken in the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] of Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick and Madawaska, Maine. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is [[morphosyntactic]]ally identical to Quebec French.<ref>Geddes, James (1908).

Essentially a local variant of Quebec French, it is one of three major forms of French that developed in what is now the U.S., the others being [[Louisiana French]] and the nearly extinct [[Missouri French]]. It is endangered, though its use has been supported by bilingual education programs since 1987.<ref name=\"Ammon\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=0-89925-356-3|pages=306\u2013308|author2=International Sociological Association|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sub-varieties ====\nTwo main sub-varieties of Canadian French have been identified.

Today, 81.4 per cent of Quebecers are first language francophones.<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\">[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/lang/provs.cfm Profile of languages in Canada: Provinces and territories<!-- Bot generated title -->]. Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref> About 95 per cent of Quebecers speak French.<ref name=statcan2016qc /> However, many of the services the provincial government provides are available in English for the sizeable [[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]] population of the province (notably in [[Montreal]]). For native French speakers, [[Quebec French]] is noticeably different in pronunciation and vocabulary from the [[French language|French]] of [[France]], sometimes called ''Metropolitan French'', but they are easily mutually intelligible in their formal varieties, and after moderate exposure, in most of their informal ones as well. The differences are primarily due to changes that have occurred in Quebec French and [[Parisian French]] since the 18th century, when Britain gained possession of Canada.\n\nDifferent regions of Quebec have their own varieties: [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], [[C\u00f4te-Nord]], [[Quebec City]], [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]], [[Outaouais (region)|Outaouais]], and [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] have differences in pronunciation as well as in vocabulary. For example, depending on one's region, the ordinary word for \"kettle\" can be {{lang|fr|bouilloire, bombe,}} or {{lang|fr|canard}}.\n\nIn Quebec, the French language is of paramount importance. For example, the [[stop sign]]s on the roads are written {{lang|fr|ARR\u00caT}} (which has the literal meaning of \"stop\" in French), even if other French-speaking countries, like [[France]], use ''STOP''. On a similar note, movies originally made in other languages than French (mostly movies originally made in English) are more literally named in Quebec than they are in France (e.g. The movie ''[[The Love Guru]]'' is called {{lang|fr|Love Gourou}} in France, but in Quebec it is called {{lang|fr|Le Gourou de l'amour}}). Also, [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] do not always use the same words as the French. Here are some examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! English !! Quebec French !! Metropolitan French\n|-\n| weekend || fin de semaine || week-end\n|-\n| parking lot || stationnement || parking \n|-\n| e-mail || courriel || mail/courriel\n|-\n| spam || pourriel || spam\n|-\n| online chat || clavardage || chat/tchat\n|-\n| beverage || breuvage/boisson || boisson\n|-\n| [[lunch]] || d\u00eener || d\u00e9jeuner\n|-\n| [[dinner]] || souper || d\u00eener\n|-\n| washing machine || laveuse || machine \u00e0 laver \n|-\n| clothes dryer || s\u00e9cheuse || s\u00e8che-linge\n|}\n\n====Use of anglicisms====\nThe term [[anglicism]] ({{lang|fr|Anglicisme}}) is related to the linguistic concepts of [[loanwords]], [[Barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]], [[diglossia]] or the [[macaronic]] mixture of the French (fran\u00e7ais) and English (anglais) languages\n\nAccording to some, French spoken in Canada includes many anglicisms. The [[Quebec Office of the French Language]]'s \"{{lang|fr|Banque de d\u00e9pannage linguistique}}\" (Language Troubleshooting Database)<ref>http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/</ref> distinguishes between different kinds of anglicisms:<ref>{{cite web|last=Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise|title=Anglicismes|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/francilettre/francilettreEX_20070914.html |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n* The entire anglicisms are words or groups of [[loan words]] from the English Language. The form is often exactly the same as in English, e.g. : \"glamour\", \"short\" and \"sweet\", but sometimes there is a slight adjustment to the French language, e.g.: \"{{lang|fr|drabe}}\", which comes from the English word \"drab\".\n* The hybrid anglicisms, which are new words, a combination of an English word to which a French element is added. This element (a suffix, for instance) sometimes replaces a similar element of the English word. \"{{lang|fr|Booster}}\" is an example of hybrid anglicism: it is made up of the English verb \"to boost\", to which the French suffix  \u2013er is added.\n* Plenty of anglicisms are semantic anglicisms: they are French words used in a sense which exists in English, but not in French. {{lang|fr|Ajourner}} (\"postpone\") in the sense of \"to have a break\", {{lang|fr|path\u00e9tique}} in the sense of \"miserable\" or \"pitiful\", {{lang|fr|plancher}} (\"floor/surface\") in the sense of \"floor\" (level of a building) and {{lang|fr|pr\u00e9judice}} (\"harm/injury\") in the sense of \"(unfavorable) opinion\".\n* The syntactic anglicisms are those relating to the word order of a sentence and the use of prepositions and conjunctions. The expression \"{{lang|fr|un bon dix minutes}}\" (\"a good ten minutes\"), for instance, comes from the English language; the more conventional French wording would be \"{{lang|fr|dix bonnes minutes}}\". The use of the preposition {{lang|fr|pour}} (\"for\") after the verbs {{lang|fr|demander}} (\"ask [for]\") and {{lang|fr|chercher}} (\"search/look [for]\") is also a syntactic anglicism.\n* The morphological anglicisms are literal translations (or {{lang|fr|[[calques]]}}) of the English forms. With this kind of loan words, every element comes from the French language, but what results from it as a whole reproduces, completely or partly, the image transmitted in English. The word {{lang|fr|technicalit\u00e9}}, for instance, is formed under English influence and does not exist in standard French (which would instead use the phrasing \"{{lang|fr|d\u00e9tail technique}}\"). {{lang|fr|\u00c0 l'ann\u00e9e longue}} (\"all year long\"), {{lang|fr|appel conf\u00e9rence}} (\"conference call\") and {{lang|fr|prix de liste}} (\"list price\") are other morphological examples of anglicisms.\n* Finally, the sentencial anglicisms are loan set phrases or images peculiar to the English language. The expressions {{lang|fr|ajouter l'insulte \u00e0 l'injure}} (\"add insult to injury\") and {{lang|fr|sonner une cloche}} (\"ring a bell\") are sentencial anglicisms. [[Loi 101|Law 101]] could postpone the advance of the phenomenon or even prevent it.\n\nAcademic, colloquial and pejorative terms are used in Canada (such as {{lang|fr|des \"sabirisation\"}} (from {{lang|fr|sabir}}, \"[[pidgin]]\"), [[Franglais]], [[Fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], [[Canadian French]]) to refer to the vernacular.\n\n====Syntactic and semantic characteristics====\n\nIn general, the same norms as in common French are applied. Only certain words have a different gender. Notable from a semantic point of view are the use of the word \"pis\" for the conjunction \"and\", where \"et\" would be used in Metropolitan French; the word \"l\u00e0\" to punctuate the end of a sentence or after a word; and the use of \"\u00e0\" instead of the possessive \"de\", for instance, \"la maison \u00e0 Jacques\" for \"Jacques's house\".\n\n====Use of the ''tu'' form====\nFrench is a language with a [[T\u2013V distinction]], where different pronouns are used for polite and familiar address. Quebecers use the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} form more than other dialects. This use is often qualified as the imitation of the English-speaking use of ''you'', which is the only pronoun referring to the second person, but only in spoken language.\n\n===Atlantic Canada===\n\n[[File:The Acadians.png|thumb|left|150px|Present-day Acadian communities]]\n\n====Historical review====\nThe colonists living in what are now the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] were principally constituted of [[Bretons]], [[Normans]], and [[Basques]]. Conquered by the English, they suffered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|massive deportations]] to the [[United States]] and [[France]]. Others went into exile to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] or to nearby islands. Those who stayed were persecuted. At the end of the 18th century, more liberal measures granted new lands to those who had stayed, and measures were taken to promote the return of numerous exiled people from Canada and [[Miquelon]]. The number of Acadians rose rapidly, to the point of gaining representation in the [[Legislative Assembly]].\n\nFrench is one of the official languages, with English, of the province of [[New Brunswick]]. Apart from [[Quebec]], this is the only other Canadian province that recognizes French as an official language. Approximately one-third of New Brunswickers are francophone,<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\"/> by far the largest [[Acadian]] population in Canada.\n\nThe Acadian community is concentrated in primarily rural areas along the border with Quebec and the eastern coast of the province. Francophones in the [[Madawaska County, New Brunswick|Madawaska]] area may also be identified as [[Brayon]], although sociologists have disputed whether the Brayons represent a distinct francophone community, a subgroup of the Acadians or an extraprovincial community of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.  The only major Acadian population centre is [[Moncton]], home to the main campus of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Moncton]]. Francophones are, however, in the minority in Moncton.\n\nIn addition to New Brunswick, Acadian French has speakers in portions of mainland Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In these provinces, the percentage of francophones is much smaller than in New Brunswick. In some communities, French is an [[endangered language]].\n\n====Origins of the dialect====\n\nLinguists do not agree about the origin of [[Acadian French]]. [[Acadian French]] is influenced by the ''[[langues d'o\u00efl]]''. The dialect contains, among other features, the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] ''r'' and the pronunciation of the final syllable in the plural form of the verb in the third person. Acadia is the only place outside [[Jersey]] (a [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] close to mainland Normandy) where [[J\u00e8rriais]] speakers can be found.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus A-C, p. 24</ref>\n\n====Some characteristics====\nThe variety of French spoken in [[Atlantic Canada]] possesses features that differ from [[Quebec French]].\n\nAccording to Wiesmath (2006),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le fran\u00e7ais acadien: analyse syntaxique d'un corpus oral recueilli au Nouveau-Brunswick, Canada|last=Wiesmath|first=Rapha\u00eble|publisher=l'Hamalthan|year=2006}}[https://archive.org/details/lefrancaisacadie0000wies].

Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref> includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of ''je'' both for the first person singular and for the third plural; the same phenomenon takes place with ''i'' for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the ''vous'' form from the ''tu'' form.\n\nHowever, because of contact with francophones from other parts of Canada, the distinctive characteristics of Acadian French have been progressively weakened.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Valdman|first=Albert|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|year=1997|publisher=Premium Press|location=New-York}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn addition, English has influenced Acadian French through the borrowing of words, many of which used to be French words used in the English language.\n\n===Ontario===\n\nAlthough French is the native language of just over half a million Canadians in [[Ontario]], francophone Ontarians represent only 4.4 per cent of the province's population. They are concentrated primarily in the [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]] regions, near the border with [[Quebec]], although they are also present in smaller numbers throughout the province. Forty per cent of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s no longer speak the language at home. However, [[Ottawa]] is the city which counts the biggest number of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s. The Franco-Ontarians are originally from a first wave of immigration from [[France]], from a second wave from Quebec. The third wave comes from Quebec, but also from Haiti, Morocco, Africa, etc.\n\nThe province has no official language defined in law, although it is a largely English-speaking province. Ontario law requires that the provincial [[Legislative Assembly]] operate in both English and French (individuals can speak in the Assembly in the official language of their choice), and requires that all provincial statutes and bills be made available in both English and French. Furthermore, under the [[French Language Services Act]], individuals are entitled to communicate with the head or central office of any provincial government department or agency in French, as well as to receive all government services in French in 25 designated areas in the province, selected according to minority population criteria. The provincial government of Ontario's website is bilingual. Residents of [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Timmins]] can receive services from their municipal government in the official language of their choice.\n\nThere are also several French-speaking communities on military bases in Ontario, such as the one at [[CFB Trenton]]. These communities have been founded by francophone Canadians in the [[Canadian Forces]] who live together in military residences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Statistiques Canada|title=Population dont le fran\u00e7ais est la langue parl\u00e9e le plus souvent \u00e0 la maison, Canada, Provinces, territoires et Canada moins le Qu\u00e9bec, 1996 \u00e0 2006 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ |accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=David Block |title=Globalization and language teaching |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |author2=Heller Monica}}</ref>\n\n====Franco-Ontarian====\n\nThe term [[Franco-Ontarian]] accepts two interpretations. According to the first one, it includes all French speakers of Ontario, wherever they come from. According to second one, it includes all French Canadians born in Ontario, whatever their level of French is.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus K-M, p. 2638</ref>\n\nThe modern Franco-Ontarian language is close to Quebec French with some rare exceptions of expressions and pronunciations. Once again, the influence of English can be noted, with a big recourse to tonic stresses, but nevertheless a French vocabulary is still used. According to Michel Laurier (1989),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le subjonctif dans le parler franco-ontarien : un mode en voie de disparition ?|last=Laurier|first=Michel|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Carleton|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUzqrzHNwP0C&pg=PA105|page=105}}</ref> the semantic and stylistic value of the use of the subjunctive is progressively disappearing.

[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was annexed by [[England]] in 1583. It is the first British possession in [[North America]].\n\nIn 1610, the Frenchmen became established in the [[peninsula of Avalon]] and went to war against the Englishmen. In 1713, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] acknowledged the sovereignty of the Englishmen.\n\nThe origin of [[Franco-Newfoundlanders]] is double: the first ones to arrive are especially of [[Breton people|Breton]] origin, attracted by the fishing possibilities. Then, from the 19th century, the Acadians who came from the [[Cape Breton Island]] and from the [[Magdalen Islands]], an archipelago of nine small islands belonging to Quebec, become established.\n\nUp to the middle of the 20th century, Breton fishers, who had Breton as their mother tongue, but who had been educated in French came to settle. This Breton presence can explain differences between the Newfoundland French and the [[Acadian French]].\n\nIn the 1970s, the French language appears in the school of Cape St. George in the form of a bilingual education. In the 1980s, classes of French for native French speakers are organized there.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\" /><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref>\n\n====Characteristics of French of Newfoundland====\nAccording to Patrice Brasseur's articles \" Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port \" (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brasseur|first=Patrice|title=Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port|journal=Glottopol, Revue de sociolinguistique en ligne|volume=9|pages=66\u201379}}[https://scholar.google.com/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624020514/https://scholar.google.com/|date=24 June 2011}}.

The provincial government of [[Manitoba]] boasts the only bilingual website of the Prairies; the Canadian constitution makes French an official language in Manitoba for the legislature and courts. Saskatchewan also has a [[Fransaskois]] community, as does Alberta with its [[Franco-Albertan]]s, and British Columbia hosts the [[Franco-Columbian]]s.\n\n[[Michif]], a dialect of French originating in Western Canada, is a unique [[mixed language]] derived from [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.

{"title_page": "Universal Tennis Rating", "text_new": "{{Advert|date=May 2018}}\n\n'''Universal Tennis Rating''' (UTR) is a global [[tennis]] player rating system intended to produce an objective, consistent, and accurate index of players' skill in the game of [[tennis]]. UTR rates all players on a single 16-point scale, without regard to age, gender, nationality, or locale of a given match. All professional players in the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) and the [[Women\u2019s Tennis Association]] (WTA)  have UTRs, as do most college players and many [[junior tennis|junior tournament players]] worldwide, as well as many adult league and tournament players. The UTR database includes results from more than 8 million matches and 200+ countries. More than 800,000 players have UTRs.<ref name=\"https://blog.universaltennis.com/2018/01/03/universal-tennis-partners-with-tennis-channel/\">{{cite web|title=Universal Tennis Partners with Tennis Channel|url=http://MyUTR.com|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nPlayers, coaches, tournament directors, tennis clubs, tennis leagues, and national federations employ UTR in varied ways. These include selecting entrants for and seeding tournaments, recruiting players for college teams, scheduling competitive matches with other teams or individuals, finding appropriate local playing or training partners, choosing which tournaments to enter, and others. UTR is the official rating system of the [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association]] (ITA). In January 2018, the [[Tennis Channel]] announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of events.<ref name=\"http://www.tennisindustry.org/cms/index.cfm/news/universal-tennis-partners-with-tennis-channel/\">{{cite web|title=Universal Tennis Partners with Tennis Channel|url=http://www.tennisindustry.org|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of Universal Tennis Rating ==\n\nUniversal Tennis Rating (UTR) is an index intended to be reliable and accurate that rates players' tennis skill. UTR rates all players\u2014men, women, and children\u2014on a single 16-point scale (with two decimal places, e.g., 11.29) that works for players globally regardless of their skill level, from beginners to top professional competitors.\n\nUTR's algorithm calculates ratings from the last 30 eligible matches played within the preceding 12 months. The main data points are the percentage of games won (not simply the won/lost result), and the opponent\u2019s rating. Each match played generates a rating; a player\u2019s UTR is a weighted average of all eligible matches.\n\n==Ratings versus Rankings==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nAlthough tennis is a global sport, it does not have a common international rating system. Tennis has nothing comparable to the [[Handicap (golf)|handicap]] system(though in France les classements par handicaps et les classements par rangs has a handicap built into their ratings) in golf  for example, which enables all golfers to record their scores on specific courses, generating a handicap that is valid on any golf course in the world.\n\nIn tennis, the vast majority of competitive players enter events only in their geographical locale. Whatever ranking they earn has meaning only within that region or country. Worldwide, hundreds of national federations govern tennis, and multiple ranking systems frequently exist within a single nation. There may be as many as 2,700 different tennis ranking and rating systems around the world.\n\nFurthermore, nearly all of these are ''ranking'' systems, not ''rating'' systems. Rankings sort players into a \"pecking order,\" assigning each athlete a spot relative to all others ranked in that system. Rankings are ordinal numbers that reflect only the athletes' relative positions, not their playing skill as measured by a standard yardstick.\n\nUTR, in contrast, rates each athlete on a single, standard metric. Therefore, tennis players' UTRs are largely independent of each other, aside from the algorithm's weighting of the strength of opponents who compete directly with the rated player.\n\nNearly all tennis ranking systems use a \"points per round\" (PPR) method that assigns points depending on what round a player reaches in a given tournament, along with the rated \"strength\" of that tournament in terms of the players it accepts into the draw. This is administratively easy, but it does not consider the skill level of the individual opponents a player faced in the event. Paradoxically, the PPR method can create an incentive to seek out ''weaker'' tournaments, in which it will be easier to survive into later rounds.\n\nThe plethora of ranking systems and the lack of a shared metric has created a \u201cTower of Babel\u201d in international tennis. National federations, tournaments, coaches, teams, colleges, and individual players speak different languages that do not readily translate into one another. Consequently, the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) and many of tennis's national governing bodies, including the [[United States Tennis Association]] (USTA), have become interested in developing a standard rating method, a kind of [https://blog.universaltennis.com/2016/02/15/tennis-metric-system/ \"metric system\" for tennis] that, like a golf handicap, could function globally.\n\n\u201cThe UTR system is great for tennis in so many ways,\u201d said former ATP Player Council president Eric Butorac, in a 2015 ''Sports Illustrated'' story on UTR. \u201cAt a UTR event, you are guaranteed to play against players who are close to your ability level. I have played a lot in France, where they have a similar system, and it works so efficiently. I hope the whole world gets on board with UTR, as it could drastically change worldwide tennis for the better.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Craig|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/10/06/universal-tennis-rating-boston-open|website=Sports Illustrated.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are two types of UTR that a player owns, UTR and Verified UTR. \"UTR counts all results, including matches played in verified tournaments/events and non-verified matches. Verified UTR counts match results played in only verified tournaments and events. For example, USTA league/tournament matches count toward Verified UTR and UTR. Casual/practice matches and self-posted scores count only toward UTR.\"<ref>https://blog.universaltennis.com/2018/07/03/how-utr-works/</ref>\n==History of Universal Tennis Rating==\n\nVirginia tennis professional Dave Howell launched UTR in 2008 as a private company to promote the rating system he developed and tested successfully in southeastern Virginia. Alex Cancado, a tennis player and web designer in the area, developed an algorithm to operationalize Howell\u2019s rating system. Howell brought in some early followers as partners and began to concentrate full-time on developing the UTR.\n<ref><ref><ref><ref></ref></ref></ref></ref>\nIn his coaching career, Howell had mentored [[Junior tennis|junior players]] from the United States who entered  [https://blog.universaltennis.com/2016/09/13/tournaments-french-style/ French tournaments]. Juniors in the U.S. compete under various ranking systems, including a widely used PPR system administered by the USTA. In contrast, France employs a national rating system based on head-to-head won/lost results. This enables French tournament directors to facilitate [https://blog.universaltennis.com/2016/04/28/level-based-play-the-key-to-exciting-tennis/ \"level-based play\"] \u2014 orchestrating matches between players of comparable skill, often without regard to their age or gender. French tournaments often use staggered-entry draws that allow stronger players to enter a tournament in later rounds. This design enables a single event to embrace a wide range of skill levels, from club players up to touring professionals, but the French classification system ensures a high probability of even matches for entrants at all levels.\n\nHowell found that the [[:fr:Syst\u00e8mes de classement nationaux au tennis|French national rating system]] yielded events that were, overall, far more competitive than junior events in the U.S. To study why this was so, he defined a \"competitive\" match as one in which the losing player wins more than half the minimum number of games needed to win the match. In the common \"best 2-of-3 set\" format, that equals seven games, as the winner must take at least 12 games to capture the match. Hence, a result of 6-3, 6-4 or closer reaches the \"[https://blog.universaltennis.com/2017/01/21/debunking-utr-myths/ competitive threshold],\" as defined by UTR. After statistically analyzing thousands of USTA boys' and girls' junior tournament matches at all levels, Howell found that on average, only about one match in four (27 percent) was competitive; USTA national junior events reached the 40 percent level.\n\nHowell modeled UTR on the French system, developing, with his colleagues, an algorithm that calculated ratings from head-to-head results with specific opponents, taking their rated skill into account. He and his colleagues also made UTR more precise than the French system by entering the number of ''games'' won in a match, not only the won/lost result.  The use of Howell's rating system in Virginia produced junior tournaments with substantially more competitive matches\u2014a rate that equalled the 50-60 percent level typically seen at the top tiers of college and professional tennis.\n\nThe Founders of the Universal Tennis Rating are: Dave Howell, Darryl Cummings, Alexandre Cancado, Steve Clark, Niclas Kohler, Johan Varverud, Raquel Araujo Kohler, and Patricia Araujo Cancado. \n\n=== Adoption and Usage of UTR ===\n\nUTR gradually spread from Virginia to other tennis venues in the United States, particularly in junior events which, as noted, often include many non-competitive matches. The system also gained traction in college tennis, which in recent decades has evolved into a truly global sport that embraces young athletes from all tennis-playing nations. But the prevalence of so many ranking and rating systems in international tennis confronted college coaches in the United States with serious problems evaluating the caliber of international recruits. By offering a standard, reliable index of skill applicable worldwide, UTR answered this quandary. Consequently, in recent years UTR has become a \"gold standard\" for assessing collegiate tennis recruits, both internationally and domestically. UTR also helps recruits match themselves with appropriate college programs.\n\nA leading proponent of UTR, Dave Fish, head men\u2019s tennis coach at Harvard University, states that \u201cThe Universal Tennis Rating system is now being recognized by many college coaches as the best metric available for judging junior talent. While the recruiting benefits of UTR are evident for both coaches and recruits, the widespread use of the Universal Tennis approach to tournament play promises to transform the entire player development system of tennis in America.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA), the governing body for college tennis in the U.S., has worked closely with Universal Tennis and now relies on UTR data to determine event seeding at U.S. college invitationals; seeding and selection for its 51 ITA/Oracle Summer Circuit tournaments; and seeding and selection in the Oracle ITA Junior Masters events. In 2016, the ITA made UTR its official rating system for college tennis in the United States.\n\nUTR also extended into the professional game, where all ATP and WTA players now have UTRs.\n\nNational federations have recognized the value of UTR for attracting players to tennis and for developing their skill through competitive matches.  Currently more than 40 national tennis federations have committed to submitting tournament results to UTR. These include the Lawn Tennis Association of Great Britain, Tennis Canada, Tennis Australia, the Brazilian Tennis Confederation, and the Bulgarian Tennis Federation.\n\nIn January 2018, [[the Tennis Channel]] announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of competition.\n\nAt the same time, a new ownership group assumed control of UTR, which is based in San Francisco, California.  Universal Tennis\u2019s chairman and CEO is Mark Leschly, founder and managing partner of [http://www.iconicapartners.com/ Iconica Partners], a global investment firm specializing in the intersection of technology, sports, and media, which heads the new ownership. The group's partners include Mark Hurd, CEO of [[Oracle Corporation]]; Ken Hao, managing partner of [[Silver Lake Partners]]; Jan Leschly, former CEO of SmithKline Beecham, a former top-ten ATP player and former chairman of the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]; Ken Solomon, president of the Tennis Channel; the [http://www.tennis.com/ Tennis Media Company]; [[Major League Baseball]]; and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]' ownership group.\n\n==Concept of Universal Tennis Rating==\n\nRecreational tennis\u2014friends hitting with each other or playing games\u2014accounts for the majority of tennis. But at the competitive level, junior play in the United States and elsewhere sorts players into age groups. Typically, this means separate tournaments for players aged 12-and-under, 14-and-under, 16-and-under, and 18-and-under. Tournaments also separate boys and girls into separate draws. Adult events normally sort entrants by half-decades, using minimum instead of maximum ages (35-and-over, 40-and-over, etc.) Separating players into groups by age and gender does organize draws simply, but it also throws together competitors in ways that are unrelated to their tennis skill.\n\nEntry to, and seedings in, tournaments typically derive from players\u2019 ''rankings''. These in turn depend on PPR amassed in previous tournaments, regardless of opponents' strengths or actual match scores. The resulting draws often pit top players against much lower-ranked athletes, especially in early rounds, frequently leading to one-sided matches.\n\nIn contrast, designing draws or flights with UTR consistently produces many more matches between athletes of roughly equal ability. Two players whose UTRs fall within 1.0 of each other will have a competitive match two to three times as often as those with ratings more than 1.0 apart. Furthermore, research has shown that when players' UTRs differ by more than 1.0 point, the lower-rated athlete will upset his or her higher-rated opponent only 3 percent of the time.\n\nClose, competitive contests are widely recognized by coaches as the most powerful engine for developing tennis skill. Even matches benefit both players. Non-competitive, one-sided matches, in contrast, typically discourage the loser and fail to challenge the winner, offering neither one much opportunity to improve his or her skills.\n\n== The Universal Tennis Rating Scale ==\n\nUniversal Tennis Ratings are expressed as a number with up to two decimal points falling between 1.0 and 16.50, e.g., 9.46. UTR's [https://blog.universaltennis.com/2017/06/29/the-universal-tennis-16-level-chart/ 16-point scale] embraces everyone from beginners through intermediate recreational and competitive players, to active tournament and college varsity athletes, and ranging up to the highest levels of the game at the top professional ranks.\n\nFor example, as of January 2018, Rafael Nadal of Spain held a UTR of 16.27 and Switzerland's Roger Federer was at 16.21. Simona Halep of Romania was rated at 13.26 and Serena Williams of the United States at 13.20. Turning to college players, NCAA Division I men generally fall between 12.0 and 15.0. NCAA Division I women typically hold UTRs between 9.0 and 12.0.\n\nThe vast majority of UTRs derive from sanctioned tournament results. Universal Tennis regularly records results from all ATP, WTA, and ITF Junior and Futures events; all sanctioned USTA junior events, and all ITA (Intercollegiate Tennis Association) and NCAA dual matches and tournaments. UTR also incorporates results from a growing number of national federations. It updates and maintains ratings for more than 800,000 current competitors, and its database includes 8 million match results. To ensure verification, UTR only accepts match results that have been published on the internet.\n\nEach rated player has a profile on the UTR website, with a singles and doubles rating based on up to 30 of the most recent matches played in a 12-month period.  These profiles display the match scores along with competitors\u2019 names and ratings. Profiles also include hometowns and, when applicable, the player's college or school team. College teams, and a growing number of high-school teams, have profile pages of their own, listing their varsity athletes and associated rating data.\n\nIn addition to including the percentage of matches that reached the competitive threshold, profiles indicate the reliability of the displayed ratings. When a new player first appears in published and/or sanctioned tournament results, that player\u2019s rating will have a low reliability percentage. Once the athlete has played five or more matches against opponents with 100-percent reliable ratings, his/her own rating will be certified as 100 percent reliable.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/10/06/universal-tennis-rating-boston-open/ Sport Illustrated: Universal Tennis Rating is a new system for grading tennis players]\n* [http://www.itatennis.com/Assets/ita_assets/pdf/UTR/Universal+Tennis+Rating+FAQ.pdf: ITA: Frequently Asked Questions about UTR]\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.myutr.com/\n* http://cummingsathletics.com/cummings/universal-tennis-rating-utr-history/ (Brief History of founding the UTR)\n\n[[Category:Tennis rankings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Advert|date=May 2018}}\n\n'''Universal Tennis Rating''' (UTR) is a global [[tennis]] player rating system intended to produce an objective, consistent, and accurate index of players' skill in the game of [[tennis]].

All professional players in the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP) and the [[Women\u2019s Tennis Association]] (WTA)  have UTRs, as do most college players and many [[junior tennis|junior tournament players]] worldwide, as well as many adult league and tournament players.

These include selecting entrants for and seeding tournaments, recruiting players for college teams, scheduling competitive matches with other teams or individuals, finding appropriate local playing or training partners, choosing which tournaments to enter, and others. UTR is the official rating system of the [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association]] (ITA). In January 2018, the [[Tennis Channel]] announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of events.<ref name=\"http://www.tennisindustry.org/cms/index.cfm/news/universal-tennis-partners-with-tennis-channel/\">{{cite web|title=Universal Tennis Partners with Tennis Channel|url=http://www.tennisindustry.org|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of Universal Tennis Rating ==\n\nUniversal Tennis Rating (UTR) is an index intended to be reliable and accurate that rates players' tennis skill. UTR rates all players\u2014men, women, and children\u2014on a single 16-point scale (with two decimal places, e.g., 11.29) that works for players globally regardless of their skill level, from beginners to top professional competitors.\n\nUTR's algorithm calculates ratings from the last 30 eligible matches played within the preceding 12 months. The main data points are the percentage of games won (not simply the won/lost result), and the opponent\u2019s rating. Each match played generates a rating; a player\u2019s UTR is a weighted average of all eligible matches.\n\n==Ratings versus Rankings==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nAlthough tennis is a global sport, it does not have a common international rating system. Tennis has nothing comparable to the [[Handicap (golf)|handicap]] system(though in France les classements par handicaps et les classements par rangs has a handicap built into their ratings) in golf  for example, which enables all golfers to record their scores on specific courses, generating a handicap that is valid on any golf course in the world.\n\nIn tennis, the vast majority of competitive players enter events only in their geographical locale. Whatever ranking they earn has meaning only within that region or country. Worldwide, hundreds of national federations govern tennis, and multiple ranking systems frequently exist within a single nation. There may be as many as 2,700 different tennis ranking and rating systems around the world.\n\nFurthermore, nearly all of these are ''ranking'' systems, not ''rating'' systems. Rankings sort players into a \"pecking order,\" assigning each athlete a spot relative to all others ranked in that system. Rankings are ordinal numbers that reflect only the athletes' relative positions, not their playing skill as measured by a standard yardstick.\n\nUTR, in contrast, rates each athlete on a single, standard metric. Therefore, tennis players' UTRs are largely independent of each other, aside from the algorithm's weighting of the strength of opponents who compete directly with the rated player.\n\nNearly all tennis ranking systems use a \"points per round\" (PPR) method that assigns points depending on what round a player reaches in a given tournament, along with the rated \"strength\" of that tournament in terms of the players it accepts into the draw. This is administratively easy, but it does not consider the skill level of the individual opponents a player faced in the event. Paradoxically, the PPR method can create an incentive to seek out ''weaker'' tournaments, in which it will be easier to survive into later rounds.\n\nThe plethora of ranking systems and the lack of a shared metric has created a \u201cTower of Babel\u201d in international tennis. National federations, tournaments, coaches, teams, colleges, and individual players speak different languages that do not readily translate into one another. Consequently, the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) and many of tennis's national governing bodies, including the [[United States Tennis Association]] (USTA), have become interested in developing a standard rating method, a kind of [https://blog.universaltennis.com/2016/02/15/tennis-metric-system/ \"metric system\" for tennis] that, like a golf handicap, could function globally.\n\n\u201cThe UTR system is great for tennis in so many ways,\u201d said former ATP Player Council president Eric Butorac, in a 2015 ''Sports Illustrated'' story on UTR. \u201cAt a UTR event, you are guaranteed to play against players who are close to your ability level. I have played a lot in France, where they have a similar system, and it works so efficiently. I hope the whole world gets on board with UTR, as it could drastically change worldwide tennis for the better.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Craig|url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/10/06/universal-tennis-rating-boston-open|website=Sports Illustrated.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History of Universal Tennis Rating==\n\nVirginia tennis professional Dave Howell launched UTR in 2008 as a private company to promote the rating system he developed and tested successfully in southeastern Virginia.
