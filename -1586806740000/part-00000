For the first session of the Imperial Diet (November 1890\u2013March 1891), there were 145 hereditary members and 106 imperial appointees and high taxpayers, for a total of 251 members. In the 1920s, four new peers elected by the [[Japan Academy|Japan Imperial Academy]] were added, and the number of peers elected by the top taxpayers of each prefecture was increased from 47 to 66 as some prefectures now elected two members. Inversely, the minimum age for hereditary (dukes and marquesses) and mutually elected (counts, viscounts and barons) noble peers was increased to 30, slightly reducing their number. By 1938, membership reached 409 seats.<ref>p. 109, \"Government: The Imperial Diet - House of Peers,\" Japan Year Book 1938-1939, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo</ref> After the addition of seats for the Empire's colonies Ch\u014dsen (Japanese colonial name of Korea) and Taiwan (Japanese name of Formosa) during the last stages of WWII, it stood at 418 at the beginning of the 89th Imperial Diet in November 1945,<ref>[[National Diet Library]], Reference (\u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9, an NDL periodical) 2005.5, Hidehisa \u014cyama [http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_999894_po_065202.pdf?contentNo=1 \u5e1d\u56fd\u8b70\u4f1a\u306e\u904b\u55b6\u3068\u4f1a\u8b70\u9332\u3092\u3081\u3050\u3063\u3066]; contains an appended table listing membership by category at the beginning of each Imperial Diet]</ref> briefly before Douglas MacArthur's \"purge\" barred many members from public office.

For the first session of the Imperial Diet (November 1890\u2013March 1891), there were 145 hereditary members and 106 imperial appointees and high taxpayers, for a total of 251 members. In the 1920s, four new peers elected by the [[Japan Academy|The Japan Imperial Academy]] were added, and the number of peers elected by the top taxpayers of each prefecture was increased from 47 to 66 as some prefectures now elected two members. Inversely, the minimum age for hereditary (dukes and marquesses) and mutually elected (counts, viscounts and barons) noble peers was increased to 30, slightly reducing their number. By 1938, membership reached 409 seats.<ref>p. 109, \"Government: The Imperial Diet - House of Peers,\" Japan Year Book 1938-1939, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo</ref> After the addition of seats for the Empire's colonies Ch\u014dsen (Japanese colonial name of Korea) and Taiwan (Japanese name of Formosa) during the last stages of WWII, it stood at 418 at the beginning of the 89th Imperial Diet in November 1945,<ref>[[National Diet Library]], Reference (\u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9, an NDL periodical) 2005.5, Hidehisa \u014cyama [http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_999894_po_065202.pdf?contentNo=1 \u5e1d\u56fd\u8b70\u4f1a\u306e\u904b\u55b6\u3068\u4f1a\u8b70\u9332\u3092\u3081\u3050\u3063\u3066]; contains an appended table listing membership by category at the beginning of each Imperial Diet]</ref> briefly before Douglas MacArthur's \"purge\" barred many members from public office.

Initially he studied theology at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to reading philosophy.)<ref>W. M. Alexander, ''Johann Georg Hamann Philosophy and Faith'', Springer, 2012 : \"Hamann left the University in 1751 or as late as 1752 without taking a degree.\"</ref> His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade.<ref>Christoph Meineke: \u201eDie Vortheile unserer Vereinigung\u201c: Hamanns Dangeuil-Beylage im Lichte der Debatte um den handeltreibenden Adel.

Johann Georg Hamann: Religion und Gesellschaft (2012)''], pp. 46\u201364.</ref>  He wrote under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of \u201cthe Magus of the North\u201d ({{lang-de|Magus im Norden}}). Hamann was a believer in the Enlightenment until a mystical experience in [[London]] in 1758.\n\nHis translation of [[David Hume]] into German is considered by most scholars as the one that Hamann's friend, Immanuel Kant, also from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], had read and referred to as inspiration for awakening from \"dogmatic slumber\". Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a [[physics]] textbook for children. Hamann also introduced Kant to the work of Rousseau.\n\n=== Music ===\nHamann was a [[lutenist]], having studied this instrument with [[Timofey Belogradsky]] (a student of [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]]), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in K\u00f6nigsberg.\n\n==Philosophical views==\nHis distrust of autonomous, disembodied [[reason]] and [[the Enlightenment]] (\"I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter\" was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in [[God]] was the only [[solution]] to the vexing problems of [[philosophy]].   \n\nOne of Kant's biographers compared him with Hamann: {{Quotation|Kant made reason the rule of his life and the source of his philosophy; Hamann found the source of both in his heart. While Kant dreaded enthusiasm in religion, and suspected in it superstition and fanaticism, Hamann reveled in enthusiasm; and he believed in revelation, miracles, and worship, differing also in these points from the philosopher. In some respects they complemented each other; but the repelling elements were too strong to make them fully sympathetic. The difference in their stand-points, however, makes Hamann\u2019s views of Kant all the more interesting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog|last=Stuckenberg|first=J. H. W.|title=The Life of Immanuel Kant|location= London|publisher=Macmillan|date=1882|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog/page/n226 202]}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn Hamann's own terms Kant was a \"[[Platonism|Platonist]]\" about reason, believing it disembodied, and Hamann an \"[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]\" who believed it was embodied. Hamann was greatly influenced by Hume. This is most evident in Hamann's conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses.  \n\n=== Works ===\nHamann's writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. For example, his work ''Golgatha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness'' (1784) was directed against [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism'' (1782). His work was also significantly reactive; rather than advance a \u201cposition\u201d of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others' work. \n\nHamann famously used the image of [[Socrates]], who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his ''Socratic Memorabilia'', an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment's dependence on reason. In ''Aesthetica in nuce'', Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature. \n\n====Editions====\nFragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of ''Sibyllinische Bl\u00e4tter des Magus aus Norden'' (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821\u201325, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). ''Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften'', edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857\u201368, and a new edition of his ''Schriften und Briefen'', edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74.\n\n===God===\nHamann argued that the [[communicatio idiomatum]], namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: 'This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.\"  Hamann believed all of creation were [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] from God for us to interpret.\n\n===Reason is language===\nHis most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s. He famously said that \"Reason is language\" (\"Vernunft ist Sprache\").<ref name=\"Brief\">Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955\u201375, vol. 5, p. 177.</ref> Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's [[Noumenon|noumenal]] and [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] realms was language, with its noumenal [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and phenomenal [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]].<br />\n\n==Legacy==\nHamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),<ref>Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.\n\nHowever, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]], and describes Hamann as a \"radical Enlightener\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J.

Initially he studied theology at the [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to reading philosophy.)<ref>W. M. Alexander, ''Johann Georg Hamann Philosophy and Faith'', Springer, 2012 : \"Hamann left the University in 1751 or as late as 1752 without taking a degree.\"</ref> His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade.<ref>Christoph Meineke: \u201eDie Vortheile unserer Vereinigung\u201c: Hamanns Dangeuil-Beylage im Lichte der Debatte um den handeltreibenden Adel.

Johann Georg Hamann: Religion und Gesellschaft (2012)''], pp. 46\u201364.</ref>  He wrote under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of \u201cthe Magus of the North\u201d ({{lang-de|Magus im Norden}}). Hamann was a believer in the Enlightenment until a mystical experience in [[London]] in 1758.\n\nHis translation of [[David Hume]] into German is considered by most scholars as the one that Hamann's friend, Immanuel Kant, also from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], had read and referred to as inspiration for awakening from \"dogmatic slumber\". Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a [[physics]] textbook for children. Hamann also introduced Kant to the work of Rousseau.\n\n=== Music ===\nHamann was a [[lutenist]], having studied this instrument with [[Timofey Belogradsky]] (a student of [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]]), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in K\u00f6nigsberg.\n\n==Philosophical views==\nHis distrust of autonomous, disembodied [[reason]] and [[the Enlightenment]] (\"I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter\" was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in [[God]] was the only [[solution]] to the vexing problems of [[philosophy]].   \n\nOne of Kant's biographers compared him with Hamann: {{Quotation|Kant made reason the rule of his life and the source of his philosophy; Hamann found the source of both in his heart. While Kant dreaded enthusiasm in religion, and suspected in it superstition and fanaticism, Hamann reveled in enthusiasm; and he believed in revelation, miracles, and worship, differing also in these points from the philosopher. In some respects they complemented each other; but the repelling elements were too strong to make them fully sympathetic. The difference in their stand-points, however, makes Hamann\u2019s views of Kant all the more interesting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog|last=Stuckenberg|first=J. H. W.|title=The Life of Immanuel Kant|location= London|publisher=Macmillan|date=1882|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeimmanuelkan00stucgoog/page/n226 202]}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn Hamann's own terms Kant was a \"[[Platonism|Platonist]]\" about reason, believing it disembodied, and Hamann an \"[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]\" who believed it was embodied. Hamann was greatly influenced by Hume. This is most evident in Hamann's conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses.  \n\n=== Works ===\nHamann's writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. For example, his work ''Golgatha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness'' (1784) was directed against [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism'' (1782). His work was also significantly reactive; rather than advance a \u201cposition\u201d of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others' work. \n\nHamann famously used the image of [[Socrates]], who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his ''Socratic Memorabilia'', an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment's dependence on reason. In ''Aesthetica in nuce'', Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature. \n\n====Editions====\nFragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of ''Sibyllinische Bl\u00e4tter des Magus aus Norden'' (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821\u201325, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). ''Hamann's des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften'', edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857\u201368, and a new edition of his ''Schriften und Briefen'', edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872-74.\n\n===God===\nHamann argued that the [[communicatio idiomatum]], namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: 'This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.\"  Hamann believed all of creation were [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] from God for us to interpret.\n\n===Reason is language===\nHis most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s. He famously said that \"Reason is language\" (\"Vernunft ist Sprache\").<ref name=\"Brief\">Johann Georg Hamann, ''Brief an Herder'', v. 8. August 1784, in: Johann Georg Hamann, ''Briefwechsel'', 7 vols., Arthur Henkel (ed.), Wiesbaden: Insel Verlag, 1955\u201375, vol. 5, p. 177.</ref> Hamann thought the bridge between Kant's [[Noumenon|noumenal]] and [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] realms was language, with its noumenal [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and phenomenal [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]].<br />\n\n==Legacy==\nHamann was one of the precipitating forces for the [[Counter-Enlightenment]]. He was, moreover, a mentor to [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and an admired influence on Goethe, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], Kierkegaard, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, ''Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles'' (Volume III in the English language translation of ''The Glory of the Lord'' series). Most recently, Hamann's influence can be found in the work of the theologians [[Oswald Bayer]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]), [[John Milbank]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), and [[David Bentley Hart]] ([[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Finally, in [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'' (Taylor, 2016),<ref>Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.</ref>  Hamann is given credit, along with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.\n\nHowever, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]], and describes Hamann as a \"radical Enlightener\" who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith.<ref>{{Cite book|title=After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J.

The film is loosely based on the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\".\n\nThe film tells the story of a construction worker who suddenly finds himself embroiled in espionage on [[Mars]] and unable to determine if the experiences are real or the result of memory implants. It was written by [[Ronald Shusett]], [[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Jon Povill]], and [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]], and won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. The [[Film score|original score]], composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], won the [[BMI Awards|BMI Film Music Award]].\n\nWith a budget of $50\u201360 million, ''Total Recall'' was [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] at the time of its release,<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=119, 123|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}</ref> although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2084, construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. The Rekall employees sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and other men, and is forced to kill them. He is then ambushed in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and \"The Agency\" sent her to monitor Quaid. Quaid knocks Lori out and runs off, pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband.\n\nAfter evading his attackers, Quaid is left a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about an alien artifact on Mars and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars. On arrival, Quaid finds a note from Hauser directing him to Venusville, populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.\n\nQuaid later encounters Rekall's Dr. Edgemar and Lori. Edgemar states that he is from Rekall and was implanted in Quaid, asserting that he suffered a \"schizoid embolism\" and is trapped in a fantasy from the implanted memories. His solution is to take an offered pill to wake up, or he will otherwise be lobotomized. Seeing sweat on Edgemar's face and realizing he isn't an implant, Quaid refuses the pill and shoots him, just as Richter's men burst into the room. Led by Lori, the men capture Quaid. Melina arrives to aid Quaid, recognizing Quaid to be truthful, and in their escape Quaid kills Lori. \n\nThey flee to Venusville with Benny, and are ushered into a secret tunnel. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to the mutant Kuato, conjoined to his brother George. Kuato reads Quaid's mind recalling a discussion with Cohaagen and Richter about the Martian artifact and its unknown purpose. Cohaagen's forces burst in and kill most of the resistance. Quaid, George/Kuato, Melina & Benny escape to an airlock. Benny kills George and reveals that he works for Cohaagen. Kuato implores Quaid to activate the reactor before being shot by Richter.\n\nQuaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina re-programmed as Hauser's obedient \"babe\", but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills him. Quaid and Melina then outwit and kill Richter and his men lying in ambush for them.\n\nQuaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb, claiming starting the reactor will destroy them all. Melina arrives and shoots Cohaagen, but he starts the bomb timer. Quaid throws the bomb down the tunnel, blowing the door open and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Quaid pushes Cohaagen aside, and Cohaagen is blown out onto the surface, where he suffocates and dies. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor rods deploy, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the turbinium glacier underneath and releasing gas, which bursts from a mountain and forms a breathable planetary atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, Venusville, and the rest of Mars' population. As the Mars humans and mutants stand on an outcropping looking at the newly blue sky, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who discovers that he is actually a secret agent formerly named Carl Hauser, and travels to Mars to uncover his true identity and why his memory was erased.\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Melina, a beautiful woman seen as the partner in Quaid's Rekall memory program who turns out to be a resistance fighter seeking to overthrow Cohaagen.\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Lori Quaid, Quaid's seemingly loving wife who is later also revealed to be an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor Quaid.

Cronenberg described his work on the project as constantly fighting and eventually falling out with Shusett: \"I worked on it for a year and did about 12 drafts. Eventually, we got to a point where Ron Shusett said, 'You know what you've done? You've done the Philip K. Dick version.' I said, 'Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing?' He said, 'No, no, we want to do ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]] Go to Mars''.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cronenberg intended to cast [[William Hurt]] in the role and envisioned the film as \"''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' goes to Mars\". Shusett claimed that another reason why Cronenberg quit the film was because around the time Dreyfuss was involved, the director wanted to go on a different approach and in Shusett's words, was \"suddenly against his own ideas\" after some disagreements.<ref>{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Tales from Development Hell: Hollywood Film-making the Hard Way|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9780857687234}}</ref> Although he went uncredited in the final version of the film, Cronenberg originated the idea of mutants on Mars, including the character of Kuato (spelled Quato in his screenplay).<ref>Robb, Brian J.

The film is loosely based on the [[Philip K.

It was written by [[Ronald Shusett]], [[Dan O'Bannon]], [[Jon Povill]], and [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]], and won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. The [[Film score|original score]], composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], won the [[BMI Awards|BMI Film Music Award]].\n\nWith a budget of $50\u201365 million, ''Total Recall'' was [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] at the time of its release,<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=119, 123|isbn=3-8228-3101-8}}</ref> although estimates of its production budget vary and whether it ever actually held the record is not certain.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2084, construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. The Rekall employees sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and other men, and is forced to kill them. He is then ambushed in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and \"The Agency\" sent her to monitor Quaid. Quaid knocks Lori out and runs off, pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband.\n\nAfter evading his attackers, Quaid is left a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about an alien artifact on Mars and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars. On arrival, Quaid finds a note from Hauser directing him to Venusville, populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.\n\nQuaid later encounters Rekall's Dr. Edgemar and Lori. Edgemar states that he is from Rekall and was implanted in Quaid, asserting that he suffered a \"schizoid embolism\" and is trapped in a fantasy from the implanted memories. His solution is to take an offered pill to wake up, or he will otherwise be lobotomized. Seeing sweat on Edgemar's face and realizing he isn't an implant, Quaid refuses the pill and shoots him, just as Richter's men burst into the room. Led by Lori, the men capture Quaid. Melina arrives to aid Quaid, recognizing Quaid to be truthful, and in their escape Quaid kills Lori. \n\nThey flee to Venusville with Benny, and are ushered into a secret tunnel. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to the mutant Kuato, conjoined to his brother George. Kuato reads Quaid's mind recalling a discussion with Cohaagen and Richter about the Martian artifact and its unknown purpose. Cohaagen's forces burst in and kill most of the resistance. Quaid, George/Kuato, Melina & Benny escape to an airlock. Benny kills George and reveals that he works for Cohaagen. Kuato implores Quaid to activate the reactor before being shot by Richter.\n\nQuaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina re-programmed as Hauser's obedient \"babe\", but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills him. Quaid and Melina then outwit and kill Richter and his men lying in ambush for them.\n\nQuaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb, claiming starting the reactor will destroy them all. Melina arrives and shoots Cohaagen, but he starts the bomb timer. Quaid throws the bomb down the tunnel, blowing the door open and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Quaid pushes Cohaagen aside, and Cohaagen is blown out onto the surface, where he suffocates and dies. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor rods deploy, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the turbinium glacier underneath and releasing gas, which bursts from a mountain and forms a breathable planetary atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, Venusville, and the rest of Mars' population. As the Mars humans and mutants stand on an outcropping looking at the newly blue sky, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who discovers that he is actually a secret agent formerly named Carl Hauser, and travels to Mars to uncover his true identity and why his memory was erased.\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Melina, a beautiful woman seen as the partner in Quaid's Rekall memory program who turns out to be a resistance fighter seeking to overthrow Cohaagen.\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Lori Quaid, Quaid's seemingly loving wife who is later also revealed to be an agent sent by Cohaagen to monitor Quaid.

They had bought the rights to [[Philip K. Dick]]'s short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" while Dick was still alive.

Cronenberg described his work on the project as constantly fighting and eventually falling out with Shusett: \"I worked on it for a year and did about 12 drafts. Eventually, we got to a point where Ron Shusett said, 'You know what you've done? You've done the Philip K. Dick version.' I said, 'Isn't that what we're supposed to be doing?' He said, 'No, no, we want to do ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]] Go to Mars''.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cronenberg intended to cast [[William Hurt]] in the role and envisioned the film as \"''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' goes to Mars\".
