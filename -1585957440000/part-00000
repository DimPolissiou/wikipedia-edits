The duchy was located in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]. Its name came from the two largest cities in the territory: [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nThe dukedom emerged in 1235 from the [[allodial]] lands of the [[House of Welf]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and was granted as an imperial [[fief]] to [[Otto the Child]], a grandson of [[Henry the Lion]]. The duchy was divided several times during the High Middle Ages amongst various lines of the House of Welf, but each ruler was styled \"Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg\" in addition to his own particular title.<ref name=\"heraldica_hanover\">{{cite web|title=Royal Arms of Britain|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalarm.htm|website=Heraldica|accessdate=10 May 2016|quote=The House of Brunswick Luneburg being one of the most illustrious and most ancient in Europe, the Hanoverian branch having filled for more than a century one of the most distinguished thrones, its possessions being among  the most considerable in Germany;}}</ref><ref name=\"riedesel_1868\">{{cite book|last1=Riedesel|first1=Friedrich Adolf|translator-last=Stone|translator-first=William L.|editor-last=von Eelking|editor-first=Max|title=Memoirs, and Letters and Journals, of Major General Riedesel During His Residence in America|volume=1|page=29|publisher=J.

For this reason, many cities and provinces in former British colonies are named after Brunswick or L\u00fcneburg. The Hanoverians never ruled Brunswick while they held the British throne, as the city was part of neighboring Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814/15, the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg territories became the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] and the [[Duchy of Brunswick]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FriedrichIIbelehntottodaskind.jpg|thumb|left|Otto the Child is enfeoffed with Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg by Emperor Frederick II, L\u00fcneburg ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', 1448]]\nWhen the [[imperial ban]] was placed on [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180, he lost his titles as [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He went into [[exile]] for several years, but was then allowed to stay on the ([[allodial]]) estates inherited from his mother's side until the end of his life.\n\nAt the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of 1235 in [[Mainz]], as part of the reconciliation between the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] and [[House of Welf|Welf]] families, Henry's grandson, [[Otto the Child]], transferred his estates to Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and was enfeoffed in return with the newly created Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, which was formed from the estates transferred to the Emperor as well as other large areas of the imperial [[fisc]]. After his death in 1252, he was succeeded by his sons, [[Albert I of Brunswick|Albert the Tall]] and [[John I of L\u00fcneburg|John]], who ruled the dukedom jointly.\n\nIn 1269 the duchy was divided, Albert receiving the southern part of the state around Brunswick and John the northern territories in the area of L\u00fcneburg. The towns of [[L\u00fcneburg]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] remained in the overall possession of the House of Welf until 1512 and 1671 respectively. In 1571 the [[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]] of [[Calv\u00f6rde]] became an [[exclave]] of the Duchy. The various parts of the duchy were further divided and re-united over the centuries, all of them being ruled by the [[House of Welf|Welf]] or Guelph dynasty, who maintained close relations with one another\u2014not infrequently by marrying cousins\u2014a practice far more common than is the case today, even among the peasantry of the Holy Roman Empire, for the [[Salic Law|salic inheritance laws]] in effect, encouraged the practice of retaining control of lands and benefits. The seats of power moved in the meantime from Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg to [[Celle]] and [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] as the towns asserted their independence.\n\n== History of the subordinate principalities ==\n[[File:Aufbau Kurf\u00fcrstentum Braunschweig-L\u00fcneburg.jpg|thumb|350px|Territorial division of the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] and dynastic relationships within the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].]]\nThe subsequent history of the dukedom and its subordinate principalities was characterised by numerous divisions and reunifications. The subordinate states that were repeatedly created, and which had the legal status of principalities, were generally named after the residence of their rulers. The estates of the different dynastic lines could be inherited by a side line when a particular family died out. For example, over the course of the centuries there were the Old, Middle and New Houses (or Lines) of  Brunswick, and the Old, Middle and New Houses of L\u00fcneburg. The number of simultaneously reigning dynastic lines varied from two to five.\n\n=== Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel ===\n{{main|Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel}}\nIn 1269 the Principality of Brunswick was formed following the first division of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. In 1432, as a result of increasing tensions with the townsfolk of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], the Brunswick Line moved their ''Residence'' to [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], into the [[Schloss Wolfenb\u00fcttel|water castle]], which was expanded into a ''[[Schloss]]'', whilst the town was developed into a royal seat. The name Wolfenb\u00fcttel was given to this principality. From 1546 Wolfenb\u00fcttel became the residence of the senior prince of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, [[Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Dannenberg]]. With sole rights to the duchy Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, he provided a conditional lease of the principality of L\u00fcneburg to the princes of Calenburg with the conditions of payment to Wolfenb\u00fcttel heirs, together with the guarantee that only his descendants would inherit this senior principality of Wolfenb\u00fcttel.  Not until 1753/1754 was the ''Residence'' moved back to Brunswick, into the newly built [[Brunswick Palace]]. In 1814 the principality became the [[Duchy of Brunswick]], with its own subordinate principalities that are all apart from the Calenburg principality from which sprang the de facto Kingdom of Hanover, a Kingdom which was declared a usurpation by the head of house, Charles II of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, in his edict of May 10, 1827. In 1866 Prussia annexed the territories and refused to recognize the Kingdom of Hanover. Prince Charles II of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel protested the violent annexation from his places of exile in Paris, as well as Geneva Switzerland, signed and sealed the 12th of April 1873.<ref>\"Le Duc de Brunswick: Sa vie et ses moeurs. Extraits der notes et ...\" pgs 411-412</ref>\n\n=== Principality of Calenberg (later Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg) ===\n{{main|Principality of Calenberg|Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg}}\nIn 1432 the estates gained by the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel between the [[Deister]] and [[Leine (river)|Leine]] split away as the Principality of Calenberg.\nTo the north this new state bordered on the [[County of Hoya]] near Nienburg and extended from there in a narrow, winding strip southwards up the River Leine through Wunstorf and Hanover where it reached the Principality of Wolfenb\u00fcttel. In 1495 it was expanded around G\u00f6ttingen and in 1584 went back to the Wolfenb\u00fcttel Line. In 1634, as a result of inheritance distributions, it went to the House of L\u00fcneburg, before becoming an independent principality again in 1635, when it was given to [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|George]], younger brother of [[Ernest II, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Prince Ernest II of L\u00fcneburg]], who chose [[Hanover]] as his ''Residenz''. New territory was added in 1665 in the vicinity of Grubenhagen and in 1705 around the Principality of L\u00fcneburg. In 1692 Duke [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]] from the Calenberg Line acquired the right to be a [[prince-elector]] as the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Prince-Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. Colloquially the Electorate was also known as the [[Electorate of Hanover]] or as ''Kurhannover''. In 1814 it was succeeded by the  [[Kingdom of Hanover]].\n\n=== Principality of L\u00fcneburg ===\n{{main|Principality of L\u00fcneburg}}\nThe Principality of L\u00fcneburg emerged alongside the Principality of Brunswick in 1269 when the inheritance of the Duchy was divided. After the death of [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke George William of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] in 1705, [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] inherited the state of L\u00fcneburg with his wife, the Duke's daughter, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle|Sophie Dorothea]], later known as the \"Princess of Ahlden\". It was united with the Principality of Calenberg, which had been elevated in 1692 into the Electorate.\n\n=== Principality of G\u00f6ttingen ===\n{{main|Principality of G\u00f6ttingen}}\nThe southernmost principality in the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg stretched from M\u00fcnden in the south down the River Weser to Holzminden. In the east it ran through G\u00f6ttingen along the River Leine via Northeim to Einbeck. It emerged in 1345 as the result of a division of the Principality of Brunswick and was united in 1495 with Calenberg.\n\n=== Principality of Grubenhagen ===\n{{main|Principality of Grubenhagen}}\nFrom 1291 to 1596 Grubenhagen was an independent principality, its first ruler being [[Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Henry the Admirable]], son of [[Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Albert of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]. The state lay ran from the northern part of the [[Solling]] hills and the River [[Leine]] near Einbeck and north of the Eichsfeld on and in the southwestern [[Harz]]. After being split in the course of the years into smaller and smaller principalities it Grubenhagen finally returned in 1596 to Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\n\n=== Other branches ===\nOther branches that did not have full sovereignty existed in the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|Dannenberg]], [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|Harburg]], [[Duchy of Gifhorn|Gifhorn]], [[Brunswick-Bevern|Bevern]], [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Osterode]], [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Herzberg]], [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Salzderhelden]] and [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Einbeck]].\n\nWhile a total of about a dozen subdivisions that existed, some were only dynastic and not recognised as states of the Empire, which at one time had over 1500 such legally recognized entities. In the [[List of Reichstag participants (1792)]], the following four subdivisions of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg had recognized representation:\n* The [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]].\n* The [[Principality of Calenberg]]-[[Principality of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], merged under Eric I of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in 1495.\n* The [[Principality of Grubenhagen]].\n* The [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]].\n\nBy 1705 only two Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg survived, one ruling Calenberg, L\u00fcneburg and other possessions, and the other ruling Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\n\n===From L\u00fcneburg to Hanover===\n{{Main|History of Hanover}}\nOne of the dynastic lines was that of the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|princes of L\u00fcneburg]], who in 1635 acquired [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]] for [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|George]], a junior member of the family who set up residence in the city of [[Hanover]]. His son [[Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Christian Louis]] and his brothers inherited Celle in 1648 and thereafter shared it and Calenberg between themselves; a closely related branch of the family ruled separately in Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\n\nAs a latter day development, what became the Electorate of Hanover was initially called the ''Elector of Brunswick-Lunenberg'' when the Holy Roman Emperor appointed [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lunenberg]] an Elector in 1696 (two years before his death) in a somewhat controversial move to increase the number of Protestant electors\u2014thereby offending the entrenched interests of the extant [[prince-elector]]s who would no longer be so few. As with most matters in Europe during these times, this was part of the centuries-long religious unrest accompanied by outright warfare (see [[Thirty Years' War]]) triggered by the zealous advocates on either side of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe territories of Calenberg and L\u00fcneburg-Celle were made an [[Prince-elector|Electorate]] by the [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] in 1692 in expectation of the imminent inheritance of Celle by the Duke of Calenberg, though the actual dynastic union of the territories did not occur until 1705 under his son George I Louis, and the [[prince-elector|Electorate]] was not officially approved by the Imperial Diet until 1708.\n\nThe resulting state was known under many different names (Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, Calenberg, Calenberg-Celle; its ruler was often known as the \"[[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hanover]]\". Coincidentally, in 1701 the [[George I of Britain|Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] found himself in the line of succession for the British crown, later confirmed in 1707 by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], which he subsequently inherited, thereby creating a [[personal union]] of the two crowns on 20 October 1714.\n\nAfter a little over a decade, the matter of the disputed electorate was settled upon the heir, and the new Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (acceded as duke on 23 January 1698), [[George I of Britain|George I Louis]] was able to style himself the '''Elector of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg''' from 1708. It was not just happenstance but similar religious driven politics that brought about the circumstance that he was also put into the line of succession for the British crown by the [[Act of Settlement]]\u2014 which was written to ensure a Protestant succession to the thrones of Scotland and England at a time when anti-Catholic sentiment ran high in much of Northern Europe and much of [[Great Britain]]. In the event, George I succeeded his second cousin [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]] \u2014 the last reigning member of the [[House of Stuart]], and subsequently formed a [[personal union]] from 1 August 1714 between the British crown and the duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (electorate of Hanover) which would last until well after the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] more than a century later\u2014including even through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of a new successor kingdom. In that manner, the \"Electorate of Hanover\" (the core duchy) was enlarged with the addition of other lands and became the [[kingdom of Hanover]] in 1814 at the peace conferences ([[Congress of Vienna]]) settling the future shape of Europe in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\n===History of the relationship to the British Crown===\nThe first [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King of Great Britain, [[George I of Great Britain]], was the reigning '''Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg''', and was finally made an official and recognized [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire in 1708. His possessions were enlarged in 1706 when the hereditary lands of the Calenberg branch of the Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg merged with the lands of the L\u00fcneburg-Celle branch to form the state of Hanover. Subsequently, George I was referred to as Elector of Hanover.\n\nIn 1700 and 1701, when the English Parliament had addressed the question of an orderly succession, with a particular religious bias toward a [[Protestant]] ruler, from the childless ruling Queen Anne ([[House of Stuart]]), it passed the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] to [[Sophia of Hanover]], granddaughter of James I. Sophia predeceased Queen Anne by a few weeks, but her son and heir, George I, succeeded as King of Great Britain when Anne, his second cousin, died in August 1714. Great Britain and Hanover remained united in [[personal union]] until the accession of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1837.\n\nGeorge I was followed by his son [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and great-grandson [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]. The last mentioned retained the position of elector even after the Holy Roman Empire was abolished by its last emperor in 1806. George III contested the validity of the dissolution of the Empire and maintained separate consular offices and staff for the Electorate of Hanover until the [[Congress of Vienna|peace conferences]] at the war's end. After the fall of Napoleon, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] regained his lands plus lands from Prussia as [[King of Hanover]], whilst giving up some other smaller scattered territories.\n\n===After the Congress of Vienna===\nAfter the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Calenberg-Celle and its possessions were added to by the [[Congress of Vienna]] ending the Napoleonic war, being born anew under the name of '''[[Kingdom of Hanover]]''' (including Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg). During the first half of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Hanover was ruled as [[personal union]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] crown from its creation under [[George III of the United Kingdom]], the last [[prince-elector|elector of Hanover]] until the death of [[William IV of Great Britain|William IV]] in 1837. At that point, the crown of Hanover went to William's younger brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale]] under the [[Salic law]]s requiring the next male heir to inherit, whereas the British throne was inherited by an [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|elder brother's]] only daughter, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\nSubsequently, the kingdom was lost in 1866 by his son [[George V of Hanover]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] when it was annexed by [[Prussia]], and became the Prussian province of Hanover.\n\n== Duchy of Brunswick ==\n{{Main|Duchy of Brunswick}}\nThe Wolfenb\u00fcttel Line retained its independence, except from 1807 to 1813, when it and Hanover were merged into the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Westphalia]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 turned it into an independent state under the name ''[[Duchy of Brunswick]]''. The Duchy remained independent and joined first the [[North German Confederation]] and in 1871 the [[German Empire]].\n\nWhen the main line of descent became extinct in 1884, the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] withheld the rightful heir, the [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Crown Prince of Hanover]], from taking control, instead installing a regent. Decades later, the families were reconciled by the marriage of [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|the Crown Prince's son]] to [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|the Emperor's only daughter]], and the Emperor allowed his son-in-law to assume rule (his father having renounced his own right).\n\n==Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and successors==\n\n===[[House of Welf]]===\n\n====Partitions of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg under Welf rule====\n\n{|align=\"center\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px; border: 1px solid black; text-align: center;\"\n|+ \n|- \n| colspan=10 style=\"background: #fff;\" |'''Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg'''<br>(1235\u20131269)\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #FFDEAD;\" |'''Brunswick'''<br>(1269\u20131291)\n| colspan=4 rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |'''L\u00fcneburg'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1269\u20131369)\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"13\" style=\"background: #B3B7FF;\" |'''Grubenhagen'''<br>(1291\u20131596)\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #00EEEE;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---G\u00f6ttingen---> \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1291\u20131292)\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #00EEEE;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---G\u00f6ttingen---> \n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"7\" style=\"background: #00EEEE;\" |'''G\u00f6ttingen'''<br>(1291\u20131463)\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1344\u20131400)\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel---> \n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel---> \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #eee;\" |''L\u00fcneburg under<br>'''[[House of Ascania|Ascanian rule]]''' ''<br>(1373\u20131388)\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---L\u00fcneburg--->\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |'''L\u00fcneburg'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1388\u20131705)\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n| colspan=4 rowspan=\"7\" style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---L\u00fcneburg---> \n|- \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Calenberg---> \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(3rd creation)</small><br>(1409\u20131485)\n|- \n| colspan=3 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |'''Calenberg'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1432\u20131584)\n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Calenberg---> \n|- \n| colspan=3 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Calenberg---> \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(4th creation)</small><br>(1494\u20131807)\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n| colspan=6 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |<small>(annexed <span style=\"background-color:#B3B7FF\">'''Grubenhagen'''</span> 1617)</small>\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |'''Calenberg'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1634\u20131692)<br><small>''Recalled Hanover 1692''</small>\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #AAEECC;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Hanover---> \n|- \n| colspan=8 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #AAEECC;\" |'''Electorate of Hanover'''<br>(1692\u20131866)\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" |''Annexed by <br>[[Kingdom of France]]''\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Brunswick'''<br>(1813\u20131918)\n|- \n| colspan=8 style=\"background: #eee;\" |''Annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia]]''\n|- \n|}\n\n====Table of rulers====\n<small>(Note: Here the numbering of the princes is the same for all duchies, as all were titled Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, despite of the different parts of land and its particular numbering of the rulers.

The duchy was located in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]. Its name came from the two largest cities in the territory: [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[L\u00fcneburg]].\n\nThe dukedom emerged in 1235 from the [[allodial]] lands of the [[House of Welf]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and was granted as an imperial [[fief]] to [[Otto the Child]], a grandson of [[Henry the Lion]]. The duchy was divided several times during the High Middle Ages amongst various lines of the House of Welf, but each ruler was styled \"Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg\" in addition to his own particular title.<ref name=\"heraldica_hanover\">{{cite web|title=Royal Arms of Britain|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalarm.htm|website=Heraldica|accessdate=10 May 2016|quote=The House of Brunswick Luneburg being one of the most illustrious and most ancient in Europe, the Hanoverian branch having filled for more than a century one of the most distinguished thrones, its possessions being among  the most considerable in Germany;}}</ref><ref name=\"riedesel_1868\">{{cite book|last1=Riedesel|first1=Friedrich Adolf|translator-last=Stone|translator-first=William L.|editor-last=von Eelking|editor-first=Max|title=Memoirs, and Letters and Journals, of Major General Riedesel During His Residence in America|volume=1|page=29|publisher=J.

For this reason, many cities and provinces in former British colonies are named after Brunswick or L\u00fcneburg. The Hanoverians never ruled Brunswick while they held the British throne, as the city was part of neighboring Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814/15, the Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg territories became the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] and the [[Duchy of Brunswick]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FriedrichIIbelehntottodaskind.jpg|thumb|left|Otto the Child is enfeoffed with Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg by Emperor Frederick II, L\u00fcneburg ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', 1448]]\nWhen the [[imperial ban]] was placed on [[Henry the Lion]] in 1180, he lost his titles as [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He went into [[exile]] for several years, but was then allowed to stay on the ([[allodial]]) estates inherited from his mother's side until the end of his life.\n\nAt the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of 1235 in [[Mainz]], as part of the reconciliation between the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] and [[House of Welf|Welf]] families, Henry's grandson, [[Otto the Child]], transferred his estates to Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and was enfeoffed in return with the newly created Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, which was formed from the estates transferred to the Emperor as well as other large areas of the imperial [[fisc]]. After his death in 1252, he was succeeded by his sons, [[Albert I of Brunswick|Albert the Tall]] and [[John I of L\u00fcneburg|John]], who ruled the dukedom jointly.\n\nIn 1269 the duchy was divided, Albert receiving the southern part of the state around Brunswick and John the northern territories in the area of L\u00fcneburg. The towns of [[L\u00fcneburg]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] remained in the overall possession of the House of Welf until 1512 and 1671 respectively. In 1571 the [[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]] of [[Calv\u00f6rde]] became an [[exclave]] of the Duchy. The various parts of the duchy were further divided and re-united over the centuries, all of them being ruled by the [[House of Welf|Welf]] or Guelph dynasty, who maintained close relations with one another\u2014not infrequently by marrying cousins\u2014a practice far more common than is the case today, even among the peasantry of the Holy Roman Empire, for the [[Salic Law|salic inheritance laws]] in effect, encouraged the practice of retaining control of lands and benefits. The seats of power moved in the meantime from Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg to [[Celle]] and [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] as the towns asserted their independence.\n\n== History of the subordinate principalities ==\n[[File:Aufbau Kurf\u00fcrstentum Braunschweig-L\u00fcneburg.jpg|thumb|350px|Territorial division of the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] and dynastic relationships within the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].]]\nThe subsequent history of the dukedom and its subordinate principalities was characterised by numerous divisions and reunifications. The subordinate states that were repeatedly created, and which had the legal status of principalities, were generally named after the residence of their rulers. The estates of the different dynastic lines could be inherited by a side line when a particular family died out. For example, over the course of the centuries there were the Old, Middle and New Houses (or Lines) of  Brunswick, and the Old, Middle and New Houses of L\u00fcneburg. The number of simultaneously reigning dynastic lines varied from two to five.\n\n=== Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel ===\n{{main|Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel}}\nIn 1269 the Principality of Brunswick was formed following the first division of the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. In 1432, as a result of increasing tensions with the townsfolk of [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], the Brunswick Line moved their ''Residence'' to [[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]], into the [[Schloss Wolfenb\u00fcttel|water castle]], which was expanded into a ''[[Schloss]]'', whilst the town was developed into a royal seat. The name Wolfenb\u00fcttel was given to this principality. From 1546 Wolfenb\u00fcttel became the residence of the senior prince of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, [[Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Dannenberg]]. With sole rights to the duchy Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, he provided a conditional lease of the principality of L\u00fcneburg to the princes of Calenburg with the conditions of payment to Wolfenb\u00fcttel heirs, together with the guarantee that only his descendants would inherit this senior principality of Wolfenb\u00fcttel.  Not until 1753/1754 was the ''Residence'' moved back to Brunswick, into the newly built [[Brunswick Palace]]. In 1814 the principality became the [[Duchy of Brunswick]], with its own subordinate principalities that are all apart from the Calenburg principality from which sprang the de facto Kingdom of Hanover, a Kingdom which was declared a usurpation by the head of house, Charles II of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, in his edict of May 10, 1827. In 1866 Prussia annexed the territories and refused to recognize the Kingdom of Hanover. Prince Charles II of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel protested the violent annexation from his places of exile in Paris, as well as Geneva Switzerland, signed and sealed the 12th of April 1873.<ref>\"Le Duc de Brunswick: Sa vie et ses moeurs. Extraits der notes et ...\" pgs 411-412</ref>\n\n=== Principality of Calenberg (later Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg) ===\n{{main|Principality of Calenberg|Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg}}\nIn 1432 the estates gained by the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel between the [[Deister]] and [[Leine (river)|Leine]] split away as the Principality of Calenberg.\nTo the north this new state bordered on the [[County of Hoya]] near Nienburg and extended from there in a narrow, winding strip southwards up the River Leine through Wunstorf and Hanover where it reached the Principality of Wolfenb\u00fcttel. In 1495 it was expanded around G\u00f6ttingen and in 1584 went back to the Wolfenb\u00fcttel Line. In 1634, as a result of inheritance distributions, it went to the House of L\u00fcneburg, before becoming an independent principality again in 1635, when it was given to [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|George]], younger brother of [[Ernest II, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Prince Ernest II of L\u00fcneburg]], who chose [[Hanover]] as his ''Residenz''. New territory was added in 1665 in the vicinity of Grubenhagen and in 1705 around the Principality of L\u00fcneburg. In 1692 Duke [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]] from the Calenberg Line acquired the right to be a [[prince-elector]] as the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Prince-Elector of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. Colloquially the Electorate was also known as the [[Electorate of Hanover]] or as ''Kurhannover''. In 1814 it was succeeded by the  [[Kingdom of Hanover]].\n\n=== Principality of L\u00fcneburg ===\n{{main|Principality of L\u00fcneburg}}\nThe Principality of L\u00fcneburg emerged alongside the Principality of Brunswick in 1269 when the inheritance of the Duchy was divided. After the death of [[George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke George William of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] in 1705, [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] inherited the state of L\u00fcneburg with his wife, the Duke's daughter, [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle|Sophie Dorothea]], later known as the \"Princess of Ahlden\". It was united with the Principality of Calenberg, which had been elevated in 1692 into the Electorate.\n\n=== Principality of G\u00f6ttingen ===\n{{main|Principality of G\u00f6ttingen}}\nThe southernmost principality in the Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg stretched from M\u00fcnden in the south down the River Weser to Holzminden. In the east it ran through G\u00f6ttingen along the River Leine via Northeim to Einbeck. It emerged in 1345 as the result of a division of the Principality of Brunswick and was united in 1495 with Calenberg.\n\n=== Principality of Grubenhagen ===\n{{main|Principality of Grubenhagen}}\nFrom 1291 to 1596 Grubenhagen was an independent principality, its first ruler being [[Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Henry the Admirable]], son of [[Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Albert of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]. The state lay ran from the northern part of the [[Solling]] hills and the River [[Leine]] near Einbeck and north of the Eichsfeld on and in the southwestern [[Harz]]. After being split in the course of the years into smaller and smaller principalities it Grubenhagen finally returned in 1596 to Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\n\n=== Other branches ===\nOther branches that did not have full sovereignty existed in the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|Dannenberg]], [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|Harburg]], [[Duchy of Gifhorn|Gifhorn]], [[Brunswick-Bevern|Bevern]], [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Osterode]], [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Herzberg]], [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Salzderhelden]] and [[Principality of Grubenhagen|Einbeck]].\n\nWhile a total of about a dozen subdivisions that existed, some were only dynastic and not recognised as states of the Empire, which at one time had over 1500 such legally recognized entities. In the [[List of Reichstag participants (1792)]], the following four subdivisions of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg had recognized representation:\n* The [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]].\n* The [[Principality of Calenberg]]-[[Principality of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], merged under Eric I of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in 1495.\n* The [[Principality of Grubenhagen]].\n* The [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]].\n\nBy 1705 only two Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg survived, one ruling Calenberg, L\u00fcneburg and other possessions, and the other ruling Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\n\n===From L\u00fcneburg to Hanover===\n{{Main|History of Hanover}}\nOne of the dynastic lines was that of the [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg|princes of L\u00fcneburg]], who in 1635 acquired [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]] for [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|George]], a junior member of the family who set up residence in the city of [[Hanover]]. His son [[Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Christian Louis]] and his brothers inherited Celle in 1648 and thereafter shared it and Calenberg between themselves; a closely related branch of the family ruled separately in Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\n\nAs a latter day development, what became the Electorate of Hanover was initially called the ''Elector of Brunswick-Lunenberg'' when the Holy Roman Emperor appointed [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lunenberg]] an Elector in 1696 (two years before his death) in a somewhat controversial move to increase the number of Protestant electors\u2014thereby offending the entrenched interests of the extant [[prince-elector]]s who would no longer be so few. As with most matters in Europe during these times, this was part of the centuries-long religious unrest accompanied by outright warfare (see [[Thirty Years' War]]) triggered by the zealous advocates on either side of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe territories of Calenberg and L\u00fcneburg-Celle were made an [[Prince-elector|Electorate]] by the [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] in 1692 in expectation of the imminent inheritance of Celle by the Duke of Calenberg, though the actual dynastic union of the territories did not occur until 1705 under his son George I Louis, and the [[prince-elector|Electorate]] was not officially approved by the Imperial Diet until 1708.\n\nThe resulting state was known under many different names (Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, Calenberg, Calenberg-Celle; its ruler was often known as the \"[[Electorate of Hanover|Elector of Hanover]]\". Coincidentally, in 1701 the [[George I of Britain|Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] found himself in the line of succession for the British crown, later confirmed in 1707 by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], which he subsequently inherited, thereby creating a [[personal union]] of the two crowns on 20 October 1714.\n\nAfter a little over a decade, the matter of the disputed electorate was settled upon the heir, and the new Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (acceded as duke on 23 January 1698), [[George I of Britain|George I Louis]] was able to style himself the '''Elector of Brunswick and L\u00fcneburg''' from 1708. It was not just happenstance but similar religious driven politics that brought about the circumstance that he was also put into the line of succession for the British crown by the [[Act of Settlement]]\u2014 which was written to ensure a Protestant succession to the thrones of Scotland and England at a time when anti-Catholic sentiment ran high in much of Northern Europe and much of [[Great Britain]]. In the event, George I succeeded his second cousin [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]] \u2014 the last reigning member of the [[House of Stuart]], and subsequently formed a [[personal union]] from 1 August 1714 between the British crown and the duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg (electorate of Hanover) which would last until well after the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] more than a century later\u2014including even through the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire and the rise of a new successor kingdom. In that manner, the \"Electorate of Hanover\" (the core duchy) was enlarged with the addition of other lands and became the [[kingdom of Hanover]] in 1814 at the peace conferences ([[Congress of Vienna]]) settling the future shape of Europe in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\n===History of the relationship to the British Crown===\nThe first [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King of Great Britain, [[George I of Great Britain]], was the reigning '''Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg''', and was finally made an official and recognized [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire in 1708. His possessions were enlarged in 1706 when the hereditary lands of the Calenberg branch of the Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg merged with the lands of the L\u00fcneburg-Celle branch to form the state of Hanover. Subsequently, George I was referred to as Elector of Hanover.\n\nIn 1700 and 1701, when the English Parliament had addressed the question of an orderly succession, with a particular religious bias toward a [[Protestant]] ruler, from the childless ruling Queen Anne ([[House of Stuart]]), it passed the provisions of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] to [[Sophia of Hanover]], granddaughter of James I. Sophia predeceased Queen Anne by a few weeks, but her son and heir, George I, succeeded as King of Great Britain when Anne, his second cousin, died in August 1714. Great Britain and Hanover remained united in [[personal union]] until the accession of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1837.\n\nGeorge I was followed by his son [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and great-grandson [[George III of Great Britain|George III]]. The last mentioned retained the position of elector even after the Holy Roman Empire was abolished by its last emperor in 1806. George III contested the validity of the dissolution of the Empire and maintained separate consular offices and staff for the Electorate of Hanover until the [[Congress of Vienna|peace conferences]] at the war's end. After the fall of Napoleon, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] regained his lands plus lands from Prussia as [[King of Hanover]], whilst giving up some other smaller scattered territories.\n\n===After the Congress of Vienna===\nAfter the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Calenberg-Celle and its possessions were added to by the [[Congress of Vienna]] ending the Napoleonic war, being born anew under the name of '''[[Kingdom of Hanover]]''' (including Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg). During the first half of the 19th century, the Kingdom of Hanover was ruled as [[personal union]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] crown from its creation under [[George III of the United Kingdom]], the last [[prince-elector|elector of Hanover]] until the death of [[William IV of Great Britain|William IV]] in 1837. At that point, the crown of Hanover went to William's younger brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale]] under the [[Salic law]]s requiring the next male heir to inherit, whereas the British throne was inherited by an [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|elder brother's]] only daughter, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].\n\nSubsequently, the kingdom was lost in 1866 by his son [[George V of Hanover]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]] when it was annexed by [[Prussia]], and became the Prussian province of Hanover.\n\n== Duchy of Brunswick ==\n{{Main|Duchy of Brunswick}}\nThe Wolfenb\u00fcttel Line retained its independence, except from 1807 to 1813, when it and Hanover were merged into the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Westphalia]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 turned it into an independent state under the name ''[[Duchy of Brunswick]]''. The Duchy remained independent and joined first the [[North German Confederation]] and in 1871 the [[German Empire]].\n\nWhen the main line of descent became extinct in 1884, the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] withheld the rightful heir, the [[Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover|Crown Prince of Hanover]], from taking control, instead installing a regent. Decades later, the families were reconciled by the marriage of [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|the Crown Prince's son]] to [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|the Emperor's only daughter]], and the Emperor allowed his son-in-law to assume rule (his father having renounced his own right).\n\n==Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and successors==\n\n===[[House of Welf]]===\n\n====Partitions of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg under Welf rule====\n\n{|align=\"center\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px; border: 1px solid black; text-align: center;\"\n|+ \n|- \n| colspan=10 style=\"background: #fff;\" |'''Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg'''<br>(1235\u20131269)\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #FFDEAD;\" |'''Brunswick'''<br>(1269\u20131291)\n| colspan=4 rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |'''L\u00fcneburg'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1269\u20131369)\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"13\" style=\"background: #B3B7FF;\" |'''Grubenhagen'''<br>(1291\u20131596)\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #00EEEE;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---G\u00f6ttingen---> \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1291\u20131292)\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #00EEEE;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---G\u00f6ttingen---> \n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"7\" style=\"background: #00EEEE;\" |'''G\u00f6ttingen'''<br>(1291\u20131463)\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1344\u20131400)\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel---> \n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel---> \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #eee;\" |''L\u00fcneburg under<br>'''[[House of Ascania|Ascanian rule]]''' ''<br>(1373\u20131388)\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---L\u00fcneburg--->\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |'''L\u00fcneburg'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1388\u20131705)\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n| colspan=4 rowspan=\"7\" style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---L\u00fcneburg---> \n|- \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Calenberg---> \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(3rd creation)</small><br>(1409\u20131485)\n|- \n| colspan=3 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |'''Calenberg'''<br><small>(1st creation)</small><br>(1432\u20131584)\n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Calenberg---> \n|- \n| colspan=3 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Calenberg---> \n| colspan=1 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Wolfenb\u00fcttel'''<br><small>(4th creation)</small><br>(1494\u20131807)\n|- \n| colspan=6 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n|- \n| colspan=4 style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n| colspan=6 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #F8F8D8;\" |<small>(annexed <span style=\"background-color:#B3B7FF\">'''Grubenhagen'''</span> 1617)</small>\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Wolfenb\u00fcttel--->\n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #FFDAED;\" |'''Calenberg'''<br><small>(2nd creation)</small><br>(1634\u20131692)<br><small>''Recalled Hanover 1692''</small>\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #AAEECC;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!---Hanover---> \n|- \n| colspan=8 rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #AAEECC;\" |'''Electorate of Hanover'''<br>(1692\u20131866)\n|- \n| colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" |''Annexed by <br>[[Kingdom of France]]''\n|- \n| colspan=2 rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #D8F8D8;\" |'''Brunswick'''<br>(1813\u20131918)\n|- \n| colspan=8 style=\"background: #eee;\" |''Annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia]]''\n|- \n|}\n\n====Table of rulers====\n<small>(Note: Here the numbering of the princes is the same for all duchies, as all were titled Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, despite of the different parts of land and its particular numbering of the rulers.

Marinelli, Ph.D.] ''Radiology'', Vol. 115, No. 2:488 \u2013489</ref> He was born in [[Argentina]] and died in [[Hinsdale, Illinois|Hinsdale]], [[DuPage County]], [[Illinois]].\n\n==Life and Education==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nMarinelli was born of Italian parents in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 28, 1906, eldest son of 6 children of bank owner Vincenzo Marinelli and Amelia Sammartino Marinelli. At age 11, he returned with widowed mother and children to Agnone, Italy, seat of the Marinelli family bell makers.  Leonidas graduated the Volta Institute of Naples, October, 1925, with the gold medal prize for highest honors. In January, 1926, he emigrated to New York City and supported himself as a meter tester while working his way through Cooper Union Night School of Electrical Engineering. In 1929 Dr. Gioacchino Failla, former student of Mme. Marie Curie, hired Marinelli to the biolphysical laboratory at Memorial Cancer Hospital, New York City, known today as [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]]).  Hardly a year later, Leonidas adapted the x-ray roentgen unit for the measurement of low-level gamma ray radiation, not previously quantifiable, which made X-ray and radium radiation comparable by the same unit.  By 1933 he coauthored his first publication with [[Gioacchino Failla|Failla]], [[Edith Quimby]], and [[John E. Rose]]. In 1938 he completed all course requirements for the PhD at Columbia University and had published 5 papers in radiological journals.\n\n==Career and Profession==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nIn 1935 Marinelli became an Assistant [[Physicist]].\n\nIn the 1940s Marinelli became an independent [[scientist]]. In 1941 his papers dealt with post-irradiation blood studies and with early [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] work on [[cancer]]; in 1942 with the production of chromosomal breaks in plant cells and with the theory of time distribution of [[Radiation therapy|radiation treatments]]. In February, 1942, he published the theoretical basis for internal radiation dosimetry that provided the basis for nuclear medicine.  In 1946, he published its systematic application to the radioactive treatment of functional cancer of the thyroid. This breakthrough was followed by [[autoradiography]] techniques and by a ''Review of Modern Physics'' report on [[beta rays]]. The explosive growth of [[radiation medicine]] enlarged his responsibilities as Head of Physics at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute. In 1948 he added to his publication of internal radiation dosimetry the supplementary biological considerations contributed by Edith Quimby.  Economic ease permitted him now to enjoy fully his role of husband and father of a wonderful family.\n\nIn 1948 he moved to the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], with a position on the [[University of Chicago]] faculty. Here, with John Rose, he provided early leadership and scientific direction of the Radiological Physics Division.\n\nMaturity was marked by authorship of textbook articles on dosimetry in the ''Annual Review of Nuclear Science'', in ''Radiation Biology'', and in the ''Handbook of Medical Radiology''. His studies of [[physics]] dealt now with electron diffusion from point sources in air\nand with the [[cosmic ray]] background. \nIn [[radiology]] he pioneered the detection of minimal burdens of [[radioactivity]] in humans, studying their distribution and\nvariation in tissues and the epidemiology of chronic low levels of radiation.\nThe Center for Human Radiobiology, which now has the responsibility for all [[Atomic Energy Commission (disambiguation)|AEC]]-supported research on the effects of internally deposited radioisotopes, grew out of his effort.\n\n==Inventions and Patents==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marinelli beakers.png|thumbnail|Marinelli beakers{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 26 May 2019|F4}}]] -->\n\n===Marinelli beaker===\nThe following footnote regarding the Marinelli beaker is found in a report by R.F.

A detector, usually a glass GM tube designed for gamma counting, was positioned in the central tube while the beaker was filled with the sample. Since the sample effectively surrounded the detector, the counting efficiency was greater than would be the case if the sample were in any other type of container.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bruner, H.D.  |author2=Perkinson, J.D.|title=A Comparison of Iodine-131 Counting Methods|journal=Nucleonics|date=October 1952|page=57}}</ref>\n\nA laboratory often used Marinelli beakers of different sizes - small beakers for small volume samples and large beakers for large volume samples.

Since Marinelli beakers could hold larger volume samples than annular GMs, they had a higher counting efficiency for [[gamma rays]]. On the other hand, their efficiency for [[beta particles]] was lower than that of annular GM tubes because the betas had to penetrate the glass of the beaker as well as the GM tube wall.  Dipping GM tubes, which were dipped into the radioactive solution, were primarily used for beta emitters. While the problem was not as severe as with the annular GM, they could be difficult to clean - a potential problem with long-lived radionuclides.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marinelli glass tube for GM.png|thumbnail|right|Marinelli glass tube for GM{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 26 May 2019|F4}}]] -->\nA different type of alternative was to dry the sample and count it with an end window GM or [[electroscope]] (e.g., the Landsverk Model L-75).

At age 11, he returned with widowed mother and children to Agnone, Italy, seat of the Marinelli family bell makers.  Leonidas graduated the Volta Institute of Naples, October, 1925, with the gold medal prize for highest honors. In January, 1926, he emigrated to New York City and supported himself as a meter tester while working his way through Cooper Union Night School of Electrical Engineering. In 1929 Dr. Gioacchino Failla, former student of Mme. Marie Curie, hired Marinelli to the biolphysical laboratory at Memorial Cancer Hospital, New York City, known today as [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]]).  Hardly a year later, Leonidas adapted the x-ray roentgen unit for the measurement of low-level gamma ray radiation, not previously quantifiable, which made X-ray and radium radiation comparable by the same unit.  By 1933 he coauthored his first publication with [[Gioacchino Failla|Failla]], [[Edith Quimby]], and [[John E. Rose]]. In 1938 he completed all course requirements for the PhD at Columbia University and had published 5 papers in radiological journals.\n\n==Career and Profession==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nIn 1935 Marinelli became an Assistant [[Physicist]].\n\nIn the 1940s Marinelli became an independent [[scientist]]. In 1941 his papers dealt with post-irradiation blood studies and with early [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] work on [[cancer]]; in 1942 with the production of chromosomal breaks in plant cells and with the theory of time distribution of [[Radiation therapy|radiation treatments]]. In February, 1942, he published the theoretical basis for internal radiation dosimetry that provided the basis for nuclear medicine.  In 1946, he published its systematic application to the radioactive treatment of functional cancer of the thyroid. This breakthrough was followed by [[autoradiography]] techniques and by a ''Review of Modern Physics'' report on [[beta rays]]. The explosive growth of [[radiation medicine]] enlarged his responsibilities as Head of Physics at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute. In 1948 he added to his publication of internal radiation dosimetry the supplementary biological considerations contributed by Edith Quimby.  Economic ease permitted him now to enjoy fully his role of husband and father of a wonderful family.\n\nIn 1948 he moved to the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], with a position on the [[University of Chicago]] faculty. Here, with John Rose, he provided early leadership and scientific direction of the Radiological Physics Division.\n\nMaturity was marked by authorship of textbook articles on dosimetry in the ''Annual Review of Nuclear Science'', in ''Radiation Biology'', and in the ''Handbook of Medical Radiology''. His studies of [[physics]] dealt now with electron diffusion from point sources in air\nand with the [[cosmic ray]] background. \nIn [[radiology]] he pioneered the detection of minimal burdens of [[radioactivity]] in humans, studying their distribution and\nvariation in tissues and the epidemiology of chronic low levels of radiation.\nThe Center for Human Radiobiology, which now has the responsibility for all [[Atomic Energy Commission (disambiguation)|AEC]]-supported research on the effects of internally deposited radioisotopes, grew out of his effort.\n\n==Inventions and Patents==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marinelli beakers.png|thumbnail|Marinelli beakers{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 26 May 2019|F4}}]] -->\n\n===Marinelli beaker===\nThe following footnote regarding the Marinelli beaker is found in a report by R.F.

Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may \"know\" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the \"messengers\" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to \"do worse\" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, \"so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\" (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])\n\nIn current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.<ref>[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}</ref> These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v.

In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]\u2014human sexuality and the anus\u2014without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.\n\nIn modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].<ref>See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].</ref> The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWhile religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that \"an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways.\"<ref>Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Buggery===\nThe modern English word \"[[bugger]]\" is derived from the French term ''{{lang|fr|bougre}}'', that evolved from the [[Latin]] ''[[Bulgars|Bulgarus]]'' or \"Bulgarian\". The [[Catholic Church]] used the word to describe members of a religious [[sect]] known as the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], who originated in [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] in the 10th Century and spread throughout [[Western Europe]] by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered [[heretic]]al. The first use of the word \"buggery\" appears in [[Middle English]] in 1330 where it is associated with \"abominable heresy\"; though the sexual sense of \"bugger\" is not recorded until 1555.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}</ref>\n''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form: \"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian]]\". Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as a sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}</ref>\n\n''Bugger'' is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation, while \"buggery\" is synonymous with the act of sodomy.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hebrew Bible===\nIn the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction \u2014 and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction \u2014 appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.<ref>Boswell, pp. 92\u201398</ref>\nIn [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.\nNeither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.\n\nMany times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.\n\nSpecific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).\n\nIn Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. \"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.\" (v. 47, NASB) \"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49\u201350, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word \"thus\" is the conjunction \"\u05d5\" which is usually translated \"and\", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)\n\nThere is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and \"abomination\" is used to describe many sins.\n\nThe [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as \"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel,\" but the word corresponding to \"sodomite\" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as \"[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]\"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Anderson\n  | first = Ray Sherman\n  | title = The shape of practical theology: empowering ministry with theological praxis\n  | publisher = InterVarsity Press\n  | year = 2001\n  | page = 267\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CagagOo11-QC&pg=PA267\n  | isbn = 978-0-8308-1559-3}}\n</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Jewett\n  | first = Paul\n  | last2 = Shuster\n  | first2 = Marguerite\n  | title = Who we are: our dignity as human : a neo-evangelical theology\n  | publisher = Wm.

As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as \"sexual immorality\".\n\nThe Greek words for \"strange flesh\" are \"heteros\", which almost always basically denotes \"another/other\", and \"sarx\",  a common word for \"flesh\", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.\n\nIn the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall \"filthy\" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word (\"aselgeiais\") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).\n\n====Epistle of Jude====\nThe [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: \"just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire\". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered \"sexual immorality and unnatural desire\" is translated \"strange flesh\" or \"false flesh\", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.\n\nOne theory is that it is just a reference to the \"strange flesh\" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.<ref>Boswell, p. 97</ref> Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,<ref>Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible</ref><ref>Vincent's Word Studies</ref>  \"out of the order of nature.\"<ref>Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A.

While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm<ref>For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.</ref> in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nChristians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations.

Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:\n\n*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' (\"No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs\")\n*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' (\"No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them\")\n*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' (\"No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds\")\n\nBurning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[N\u012b\u00fe|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]\nBenedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.\n\nThis came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].<ref>G. Legman \"The Guilt of the Templars\" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.</ref>  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W. A. P.|authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips}}</ref>\n\nPersecution of Cathars and the [[Bogomiles]] sect in [[Bulgaria]] led to the use of a term closely related to ''sodomy'': ''buggery'' derives from French ''bouggerie'', meaning \"of Bulgaria\".<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> The association of ''sodomy'' with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials.{{cn|date=September 2019}} \n\nThe [[Book of Wisdom]], which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality:\n\n:\"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers.\"\n:\"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.\" ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/kjv.Wis.19.html#Wis.19.13 Wisdom 19:13-14])\n\n===Sodomy laws in 18th-century Europe===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Amsterdam sodomites 1730.png|thumb|upright|A [[wanted poster]], published in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in 1730, accusing ten men of \"the abominable crime of sodomy\" ({{lang|nl|de verfoeyelyke Crimen van Sodomie}})]]\n\nAn examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the [[Old Bailey]] in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#assaultwithsodomiticalintent Crimes tried at the Old Bailey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602121130/https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp |date=2017-06-02 }}, ''Proceedings of the Old Bailey'' online</ref>  Sodomy crimes in England could mean \"sexually assaulting a young child\" and could result in a sentence of [[death recorded]], i.e., not an actual death sentence at all.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zipporah Osei |title=An Author Learned of a Mortifying Research Mistake Live on the Radio.

However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize \"this vice\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nPeriodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nIn 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing.

Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges</ref> while the opposing position interprets it to mean \"interrogate.\"<ref>John J. McNeil, ''The Church and the Homosexual'', p. 50</ref> Lot's offering of his two virgins has been interpreted to mean that Lot is offering a compromise to assure the crowd that the two men have no untoward intentions in town, or that he is offering his virgins as a substitute for the men to \"know\" by sexual intercourse.\n\nThose who oppose the interpretation of sexual intent toward Lot's guests point out that there are over 930 occurrences of the Hebrew word (y\u00e2da\u201b) for \"know\" in the Old Testament, and its use to denote sexual intercourse only occurs about a dozen times, and in the [[Septuagint]] it is not rendered sexually. Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of ''y\u00e2da\u201b'' denoting sex is in Genesis,<ref>''Homosexuality and the Old Testament'', P. Michael Ukleja</ref> (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8 sex the obvious meaning.

Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may \"know\" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the \"messengers\" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to \"do worse\" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, \"so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\" (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])\n\nIn current usage, the term is particularly used in law.

In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]\u2014human sexuality and the anus\u2014without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.\n\nIn modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].<ref>See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].</ref> The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWhile religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that \"an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways.\"<ref>Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Buggery===\nThe modern English word \"[[bugger]]\" is derived from the French term ''{{lang|fr|bougre}}'', that evolved from the [[Latin]] ''[[Bulgars|Bulgarus]]'' or \"Bulgarian\". The [[Catholic Church]] used the word to describe members of a religious [[sect]] known as the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], who originated in [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] in the 10th Century and spread throughout [[Western Europe]] by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered [[heretic]]al. The first use of the word \"buggery\" appears in [[Middle English]] in 1330 where it is associated with \"abominable heresy\"; though the sexual sense of \"bugger\" is not recorded until 1555.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}</ref>\n''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form: \"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian]]\". Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as a sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}</ref>\n\n''Bugger'' is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation, while \"buggery\" is synonymous with the act of sodomy.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hebrew Bible===\nIn the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction \u2014 and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction \u2014 appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.<ref>Boswell, pp. 92\u201398</ref>\nIn [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.\nNeither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.\n\nMany times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.\n\nSpecific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).\n\nIn Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. \"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.\" (v. 47, NASB) \"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49\u201350, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word \"thus\" is the conjunction \"\u05d5\" which is usually translated \"and\", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)\n\nThere is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and \"abomination\" is used to describe many sins.\n\nThe [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as \"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel,\" but the word corresponding to \"sodomite\" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as \"[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]\"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Anderson\n  | first = Ray Sherman\n  | title = The shape of practical theology: empowering ministry with theological praxis\n  | publisher = InterVarsity Press\n  | year = 2001\n  | page = 267\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CagagOo11-QC&pg=PA267\n  | isbn = 978-0-8308-1559-3}}\n</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Jewett\n  | first = Paul\n  | last2 = Shuster\n  | first2 = Marguerite\n  | title = Who we are: our dignity as human : a neo-evangelical theology\n  | publisher = Wm.

As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as \"sexual immorality\".\n\nThe Greek words for \"strange flesh\" are \"heteros\", which almost always basically denotes \"another/other\", and \"sarx\",  a common word for \"flesh\", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.\n\nIn the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall \"filthy\" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word (\"aselgeiais\") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).\n\n====Epistle of Jude====\nThe [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: \"just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire\". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered \"sexual immorality and unnatural desire\" is translated \"strange flesh\" or \"false flesh\", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.\n\nOne theory is that it is just a reference to the \"strange flesh\" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.<ref>Boswell, p. 97</ref> Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,<ref>Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible</ref><ref>Vincent's Word Studies</ref>  \"out of the order of nature.\"<ref>Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A.

While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm<ref>For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.</ref> in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nChristians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations.

Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:\n\n*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' (\"No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs\")\n*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' (\"No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them\")\n*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' (\"No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds\")\n\nBurning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[N\u012b\u00fe|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]\nBenedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.\n\nThis came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].<ref>G. Legman \"The Guilt of the Templars\" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.</ref>  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W.

However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize \"this vice\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nPeriodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nIn 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing.

Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of ''y\u00e2da\u201b'' denoting sex is in Genesis,<ref>''Homosexuality and the Old Testament'', P. Michael Ukleja</ref> (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8 sex the obvious meaning.

At the insistence of his friend [[Erasmus]], he prepared an elaborate commentary on [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''De Civitate Dei'', which was published in 1522 with a dedication to [[Henry VIII of England]]. Soon afterwards, he was invited to [[England]], and acted as tutor to [[Mary I of England|the Princess Mary]], for whose use he wrote ''De ratione studii puerilis epistolae duae'' (1523) and, ostensibly, ''[[De Institutione Feminae Christianae]]'', on the education of girls (a book he dedicated to the English queen [[Catherine of Aragon]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I24XIEGvQbAC&lpg=PP1&dq=De%20Institutione%20Feminae%20Christianae&pg=PR25#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=De Institutione Feminae Christianae - Juan Luis Vives, Constantinus Matheeussen, Charles Fantazzi - Google Boeken |accessdate=2012-10-14|isbn=978-9004106598 |year=1996 |last1=Vives |first1=Juan Luis }}</ref>\n\nWhile in England, he resided at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where Erasmus had strong ties.  Vives was made doctor of laws and lectured on [[philosophy]]. Having declared himself against the [[Catherine of Aragon#The King's \"great matter\"|annulment]] of the marriage of Henry VIII and [[Catherine of Aragon]], he lost royal favour and was confined to his house for six weeks. On his release, he withdrew to [[Bruges]], where he devoted the rest of his life to the composition of numerous works, chiefly directed against the scholastic philosophy and the preponderant unquestioning authority of [[Aristotle]]. The most important of his treatises is the ''De Causis Corruptarum Artium'', which has been ranked with [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organon]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis most important pedagogic work are ''Introductio ad sapientiam'' (1524); ''De disciplinis'', which stressed the urgent importance of more rational programs of education and studying; ''De prima philosophia''; and the ''Exercitatio linguae latinae'', which is a Latin textbook consisting of a series of brilliant{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} dialogues. His philosophical works include ''De anima et vita'' (1538), ''De veritate fidei Christianae''; and \"De Subventione Pauperum Sive de Humanis Necessitatibus\" (On Assistance To The Poor) (1526), the first tract of its kind in the Western world to treat the problem of urban poverty and propose concrete suggestions for a policy of social legislation. Vives detected through [[Textual criticism|philological analysis]]<ref>Published in ''XXII libros de Civitate Dei Commentaria'', 1522.</ref> that the supposed author of the so-called [[Letter of Aristeas]], purporting to describe the Biblical translation of the [[Septuagint]], could not have been a Greek but must have been a Jew who lived after the events he described had transpired.\n\nHe died in [[Bruges]] in 1540, at the age of 47,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and was buried in the [[St. Donatian's Cathedral]].\n\n==State assistance for those in poverty==\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], poor relief was usually the responsibility of the Church and individuals through almsgiving.  As society became more advanced, these efforts became inadequate. In 1525, the Dutch city of Bruges requested Vives to suggest means to address the issue of relief for the poor.  He set out his views in his essay ''De Subventione Pauperum Sive de Humanis Necessitatibus'' (On Assistance To The Poor).  Vives argued that the state had a responsibility to provide some level of financial relief for the poor, as well as craft training for the unskilled poor.  The city of Bruges did not implement Vives's suggestions until 1557, but his proposals influenced social relief legislation enacted in [[Poor relief|England]] and the German Empire during the 1530s.\n\n==Contemporary relevance==\nVives imagined and described a comprehensive theory of education.  He may have directly influenced the essays of [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Smith, William F.|year=1946|title=Vives and Montaigne as Educators. |journal=Hispania |pages=483\u2013493 |jstor=333706|volume=29 |issue=4|doi=10.2307/333706}}</ref> as well as John Henry Newman. He was admired by [[Thomas More]] and [[Erasmus]], who wrote that Vives \"will overshadow the name of Erasmus.\"<ref>Watson, Foster (1913).

While it is unknown if Freud was familiar with Vives's work, historian of psychiatry Gregory Zilboorg considered Vives a godfather of psychoanalysis.

His idea of a diverse and concrete children's education long preceded [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], and may have indirectly influenced Rousseau through Montaigne.\n\nHowever influential he may have been in the 16th century, Vives now attracts minimal interest beyond specialized academic fields. The values of Vives inspired two Belgian Schools for higher education (KATHO and [[Katholieke Hogeschool Brugge-Oostende]]) to choose the name 'Vives' as the name for their cooperation/merger starting from September 2013. Also, the regional link of Vives with the province of [[West Flanders]], of which Bruges is the capital, played a role.\n\n===Gender roles and responsibilities===\nSome see Vives altering classical rhetoric to express his own sort of pro-virginity half-feminism - which remains of interest to historians of gender.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patton, Elizabeth|year=1994|title=''Women and the rhetoric of Renaissance pedagogy'' [doctoral thesis]|publisher=English and Comp.

He believed that understanding how the soul functions is more valuable than understanding the soul itself. \"He was not concerned with what the soul is, but rather what the soul was like\".{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=337|ps=}} Norena explains that Vives thought that the soul had certain characteristics.  He believed that the best part of the soul is its ability to \"\u2026understand, remember, reason, and judge.\" {{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=203|ps=}} Vives touched on the mind in terms of his explanations of the soul\u2014he claims that one cannot simply define what the soul is, but by piecing together parts of it, a better concept of how the soul works can be achieved. He compared the soul to art with an analogy by stating: \"How we perceive a painted picture is more telling than declaring what the picture is itself\".{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=337|ps=}} Vives rejected the [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human behavior, and said instead that our soul can \"modify our behavior in ethically and socially.\"{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=225|ps=}} He also suggested that the way we feel day to day affects whether our soul is attaining good or evil.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=231|ps=}}\n\n===Insight on medicine===\nVives is acknowledged for integrating psychology and medicine. \"His ideas were new and they paved the way for other contributions that have greatly impacted our society today in terms of how we view the impact of medicine on humans\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} He expressed the importance of [[animal testing]] before doing so on to people -\u2013\"Although Vives did not perform actual medical procedures, his suggestions were among the first of his time.\" {{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} Vives had hopes that his ideas would influence the public. \"With time, some may argue that a sort of social reform was created largely due to Vives' ideas on medicine\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} Clements described Vives' contributions as being \"original,\" yet many would classify him as being very underrated in terms of his accomplishments and ideas.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} Vives also made important early observations on the health of the human body-\u2014he urged that \"Personal habits of cleanliness and temperance greatly impacted health\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} He claimed that the cleanliness of the body impacts the welfare of the body and the mind.{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=187|ps=}} He touched on how to medicate the mentally unstable by saying that mocking, exciting, and irritating those individuals who are mentally ill does not contribute to their treatment.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} Vives said that \"Using the mentally ill as a form of entertainment is one of the most inhumane practices he had ever encountered\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} His belief was that some individuals who are mentally ill should be provided medication, but others just need friendly treatment.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=222|ps=}}\n\n===Emotions and the body===\n[[File:Juan Viv\u00e8s.JPG|thumb|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Juan Luis Vives in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\nAnother psychological contribution from Vives involves his thoughts on emotion. His ideas were largely influenced by the ideologies that came from [[Galen]] and [[Hippocrates]] in terms of how emotion is related to [[bile]] in the body.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} He agreed with the two with the belief that \"different colored biles that humans have reflected different types of emotions\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=224|ps=}} Further, Vives believed that \"Certain emotions color bile inside of human bodies and colored bodies likewise influences emotions\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=223|ps=}} According to Norena, Vives followed Galen's recommendations of eating certain types of food for certain types of temperaments.{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=187|ps=}} Vives also suggested that almost all of our emotions, even those considered to be negative, are actually beneficial in a lot of ways.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=231|ps=}} He expressed how there is potential to learn and grow from negative emotions as well as positive emotions. His emphasis on [[animism]], or animal spirits, influenced Descartes according to Clements.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=223|ps=}} Vives suggested in his work that the degree in which how strongly a person believes in his or her morals have a great impact on the way they feel about themselves-\u2014\"mental strength can influence physical strength\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} Emotions, according to Vives, can be divided up into \"Hot, cold, moist, dry, and varying combinations of the four\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=222|ps=}} Personality disturbances with emotions could be fixed when applying the correct temperature on to the body.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=224|ps=}}\n\n===Memory===\nVives placed emphasis on memory. He defined memory as \"\u2026relating to the past, while [[perception]] relates to the present\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=226|ps=}} \"Memory is something that is retained by either externally or internally perceiving it\". {{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=23|ps=}} He especially emphasized how humans imagine something internally and connect it with an event in order to create a memory. This, according to Vives, makes [[information retrieval]] of memory easier.{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}}  He touched on memories in which we are unaware of, otherwise known as the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}}  He said information is the \"Most accessible from memory when a certain amount of attention is given.\" According to Murray, Vives showed understanding of the modern-day conception of how humans process retrieval.{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}} Vives observed that the more a memory is connected to a strong emotional experience, the easier it can be remembered. In terms of retaining memory, imagination was thought to play a key role, especially in children. {{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=187|ps=}} He also believed in a theory that pointed towards the fact that memory can be improved with practice. He advised that \"One should memorize something every day, even a useless quotation.\"{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=188|ps=}} Vives even touched on childhood memory-\u2014he believed that children learn quickly because their mind is less cluttered with worries that adult minds have. Vives also believed that recall of memory is brought about by a concept in which the soul processes the memory. Vives himself had a recall experience as a child where he ate cherries when he had a fever.  When he had cherries again as an adult, he \"felt as though he was sick just as he was when he was a child.\"{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=339|ps=}} He found this remarkable and determined that memory can exist unconsciously for a very long time. He also believed that \"memory declines every day that the mind is not exercised.\"{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=341|ps=}}\n\n===Learning===\nVives used the word \"intelligence\" in a way that can be translated to the word \"supervisor\" as we know its meaning today: intelligence, according to Vives, involves functions directing attention from different kinds of [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]].{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=23|ps=}} Intelligence is very much a [[cognitive]] structure according to Vives. When we learn, the memory of the experience is locked in an order of the actual intelligence.{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}}  Vives' perception on intelligence is that it is only important when it is put to use. Having an intelligent gift is only meaningful when the person is actively exercising it. The exercising of intelligence is important in retaining memory, which creates a better learning experience in general. Vives was among the first to suggest that the health of a student, the personality of the teacher, the classroom environment and the types of authors that the students are required to read from are all very important in how the student learns.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} \"Vives placed special stress upon the proper environment of the school as the first ecological ingredient of the child's sense experience.\"{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=186|ps=}} He compared learning and gaining knowledge to how humans digest food.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} Feeding the mind with knowledge is the same as feeding the body with food; it is essential to the human being.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=221|ps=}}\n\n==Major works==\n\n*''Opuscula varia ''(1519), collection of small works include Vives' first philosophical works, ''De initiis, sectis et laudibus philosophiae''.\n*''Adversus pseudodialecticos ''(1520)\n*''De subventione pauperum.

Shortly thereafter, he left Spain never to return.\n\nWhile still in Spain, he attended the [[Valencia Academy]], where he was taught by [[Jerome Amiguetus]] and [[Daniel Siso]]. The school was dominated by [[scholasticism]], with the [[dialectic]] and [[disputation]] playing a central role in the delivery of education.\n\n<blockquote>Even the youngest scholars are accustomed never to keep silence; they are always asserting vigorously whatever comes uppermost to their minds, lest they should seem to be giving up the dispute. Nor does one disputation, or even two a day prove sufficient, as for instance at dinner. They wrangle at breakfast; they wrangle after breakfast; they wrangle before supper and they wrangle after supper. At home they dispute, out of doors they dispute. They wrangle over their food, in the bath, in the sweating room, in the church, in the town, in the country, in public, in private.

At the insistence of his friend [[Erasmus]], he prepared an elaborate commentary on [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''De Civitate Dei'', which was published in 1522 with a dedication to [[Henry VIII of England]]. Soon afterwards, he was invited to [[England]], and acted as tutor to [[Mary I of England|the Princess Mary]], for whose use he wrote ''De ratione studii puerilis epistolae duae'' (1523) and, ostensibly, ''[[De Institutione Feminae Christianae]]'', on the education of girls (a book he dedicated to the English queen [[Catherine of Aragon]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I24XIEGvQbAC&lpg=PP1&dq=De%20Institutione%20Feminae%20Christianae&pg=PR25#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=De Institutione Feminae Christianae - Juan Luis Vives, Constantinus Matheeussen, Charles Fantazzi - Google Boeken |accessdate=2012-10-14|isbn=978-9004106598 |year=1996 |last1=Vives |first1=Juan Luis }}</ref>\n\nWhile in England, he resided at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where Erasmus had strong ties.  Vives was made doctor of laws and lectured on [[philosophy]]. Having declared himself against the [[Catherine of Aragon#The King's \"great matter\"|annulment]] of the marriage of Henry VIII and [[Catherine of Aragon]], he lost royal favour and was confined to his house for six weeks. On his release, he withdrew to [[Bruges]], where he devoted the rest of his life to the composition of numerous works, chiefly directed against the scholastic philosophy and the preponderant unquestioning authority of [[Aristotle]]. The most important of his treatises is the ''De Causis Corruptarum Artium'', which has been ranked with [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organon]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis most important pedagogic work are ''Introductio ad sapientiam'' (1524); ''De disciplinis'', which stressed the urgent importance of more rational programs of education and studying; ''De prima philosophia''; and the ''Exercitatio linguae latinae'', which is a Latin textbook consisting of a series of brilliant{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} dialogues. His philosophical works include ''De anima et vita'' (1538), ''De veritate fidei Christianae''; and \"De Subventione Pauperum Sive de Humanis Necessitatibus\" (On Assistance To The Poor) (1526), the first tract of its kind in the Western world to treat the problem of urban poverty and propose concrete suggestions for a policy of social legislation. Vives detected through [[Textual criticism|philological analysis]]<ref>Published in ''XXII libros de Civitate Dei Commentaria'', 1522.</ref> that the supposed author of the so-called [[Letter of Aristeas]], purporting to describe the Biblical translation of the [[Septuagint]], could not have been a Greek but must have been a Jew who lived after the events he described had transpired.\n\nHe died in [[Bruges]] in 1540, at the age of 47,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and was buried in the [[St. Donatian's Cathedral]].\n\n==State assistance for those in poverty==\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], poor relief was usually the responsibility of the Church and individuals through almsgiving.  As society became more advanced, these efforts became inadequate. In 1525, the Dutch city of Bruges requested Vives to suggest means to address the issue of relief for the poor.  He set out his views in his essay ''De Subventione Pauperum Sive de Humanis Necessitatibus'' (On Assistance To The Poor).  Vives argued that the state had a responsibility to provide some level of financial relief for the poor, as well as craft training for the unskilled poor.  The city of Bruges did not implement Vives's suggestions until 1557, but his proposals influenced social relief legislation enacted in [[Poor relief|England]] and the German Empire during the 1530s.\n\n==Contemporary relevance==\nVives imagined and described a comprehensive theory of education.  He may have directly influenced the essays of [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Smith, William F.|year=1946|title=Vives and Montaigne as Educators. |journal=Hispania |pages=483\u2013493 |jstor=333706|volume=29 |issue=4|doi=10.2307/333706}}</ref> as well as John Henry Newman. He was admired by [[Thomas More]] and [[Erasmus]], who wrote that Vives \"will overshadow the name of Erasmus.\"<ref>Watson, Foster (1913).

While it is unknown if Freud was familiar with Vives's work, historian of psychiatry Gregory Zilboorg considered Vives a godfather of psychoanalysis.

His idea of a diverse and concrete children's education long preceded [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], and may have indirectly influenced Rousseau through Montaigne.\n\nHowever influential he may have been in the 16th century, Vives now attracts minimal interest beyond specialized academic fields. The values of Vives inspired two Belgian Schools for higher education (KATHO and [[Katholieke Hogeschool Brugge-Oostende]]) to choose the name 'Vives' as the name for their cooperation/merger starting from September 2013. Also, the regional link of Vives with the province of [[West Flanders]], of which Bruges is the capital, played a role.\n\n===Gender Roles and Responsibilities===\nSome see Vives altering classical rhetoric to express his own sort of pro-virginity half-feminism - which remains of interest to historians of gender.<ref>{{cite web|author=Patton, Elizabeth|year=1994|title=''Women and the rhetoric of Renaissance pedagogy'' [doctoral thesis]|publisher=English and Comp.

Therefore, since woman is a weak creature and of uncertain judgment and is easily deceived (as Eve, the first parent of mankind, demonstrated, whom the devil deluded with such a slight pretext), she should not teach, lest when she has convinced herself of some false opinion, she transmit it to her listeners in her role as a teacher and easily drag others into her error, since pupils willingly follow their teacher.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Emerging Female Citizen: Gender and Enlightenment|page=24|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/content/chapters/10493.ch01.pdf|accessdate=29 June 2015|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nHis ''De institutione feminae christianae'', published in 1523, was commissioned by [[Catherine of Aragon]], Catholic [[Queen consort]] of [[Henry VIII of England]], for her daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]] to instruct her on the proper roles for her sex.

He compared the soul to art with an analogy by stating: \"How we perceive a painted picture is more telling than declaring what the picture is itself\".{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=337|ps=}} Vives rejected the [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human behavior, and said instead that our soul can \"modify our behavior in ethically and socially.\"{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=225|ps=}} He also suggested that the way we feel day to day affects whether our soul is attaining good or evil.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=231|ps=}}\n\n===Insight on medicine===\nVives is acknowledged for integrating psychology and medicine. \"His ideas were new and they paved the way for other contributions that have greatly impacted our society today in terms of how we view the impact of medicine on humans\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} He expressed the importance of [[animal testing]] before doing so on to people -\u2013\"Although Vives did not perform actual medical procedures, his suggestions were among the first of his time.\" {{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} Vives had hopes that his ideas would influence the public. \"With time, some may argue that a sort of social reform was created largely due to Vives' ideas on medicine\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} Clements described Vives' contributions as being \"original,\" yet many would classify him as being very underrated in terms of his accomplishments and ideas.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} Vives also made important early observations on the health of the human body-\u2014he urged that \"Personal habits of cleanliness and temperance greatly impacted health\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} He claimed that the cleanliness of the body impacts the welfare of the body and the mind.{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=187|ps=}} He touched on how to medicate the mentally unstable by saying that mocking, exciting, and irritating those individuals who are mentally ill does not contribute to their treatment.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} Vives said that \"Using the mentally ill as a form of entertainment is one of the most inhumane practices he had ever encountered\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} His belief was that some individuals who are mentally ill should be provided medication, but others just need friendly treatment.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=222|ps=}}\n\n===Emotions and the body===\n[[File:Juan Viv\u00e8s.JPG|thumb|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Juan Luis Vives in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\nAnother psychological contribution from Vives involves his thoughts on emotion. His ideas were largely influenced by the ideologies that came from [[Galen]] and [[Hippocrates]] in terms of how emotion is related to [[bile]] in the body.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=219|ps=}} He agreed with the two with the belief that \"different colored biles that humans have reflected different types of emotions\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=224|ps=}} Further, Vives believed that \"Certain emotions color bile inside of human bodies and colored bodies likewise influences emotions\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=223|ps=}} According to Norena, Vives followed Galen's recommendations of eating certain types of food for certain types of temperaments.{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=187|ps=}} Vives also suggested that almost all of our emotions, even those considered to be negative, are actually beneficial in a lot of ways.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=231|ps=}} He expressed how there is potential to learn and grow from negative emotions as well as positive emotions. His emphasis on [[animism]], or animal spirits, influenced Descartes according to Clements.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=223|ps=}} Vives suggested in his work that the degree in which how strongly a person believes in his or her morals have a great impact on the way they feel about themselves-\u2014\"mental strength can influence physical strength\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} Emotions, according to Vives, can be divided up into \"Hot, cold, moist, dry, and varying combinations of the four\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=222|ps=}} Personality disturbances with emotions could be fixed when applying the correct temperature on to the body.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=224|ps=}}\n\n===Memory===\nVives placed emphasis on memory. He defined memory as \"\u2026relating to the past, while [[perception]] relates to the present\".{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=226|ps=}} \"Memory is something that is retained by either externally or internally perceiving it\". {{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=23|ps=}} He especially emphasized how humans imagine something internally and connect it with an event in order to create a memory. This, according to Vives, makes [[information retrieval]] of memory easier.{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}}  He touched on memories in which we are unaware of, otherwise known as the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}}  He said information is the \"Most accessible from memory when a certain amount of attention is given.\" According to Murray, Vives showed understanding of the modern-day conception of how humans process retrieval.{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}} Vives observed that the more a memory is connected to a strong emotional experience, the easier it can be remembered. In terms of retaining memory, imagination was thought to play a key role, especially in children. {{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=187|ps=}} He also believed in a theory that pointed towards the fact that memory can be improved with practice. He advised that \"One should memorize something every day, even a useless quotation.\"{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=188|ps=}} Vives even touched on childhood memory-\u2014he believed that children learn quickly because their mind is less cluttered with worries that adult minds have. Vives also believed that recall of memory is brought about by a concept in which the soul processes the memory. Vives himself had a recall experience as a child where he ate cherries when he had a fever.  When he had cherries again as an adult, he \"felt as though he was sick just as he was when he was a child.\"{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=339|ps=}} He found this remarkable and determined that memory can exist unconsciously for a very long time. He also believed that \"memory declines every day that the mind is not exercised.\"{{sfnp|Watson|1915|p=341|ps=}}\n\n===Learning===\nVives used the word \"intelligence\" in a way that can be translated to the word \"supervisor\" as we know its meaning today: intelligence, according to Vives, involves functions directing attention from different kinds of [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]].{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=23|ps=}} Intelligence is very much a [[cognitive]] structure according to Vives. When we learn, the memory of the experience is locked in an order of the actual intelligence.{{sfnp|Murray|1982|p=26|ps=}}  Vives' perception on intelligence is that it is only important when it is put to use. Having an intelligent gift is only meaningful when the person is actively exercising it. The exercising of intelligence is important in retaining memory, which creates a better learning experience in general. Vives was among the first to suggest that the health of a student, the personality of the teacher, the classroom environment and the types of authors that the students are required to read from are all very important in how the student learns.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} \"Vives placed special stress upon the proper environment of the school as the first ecological ingredient of the child's sense experience.\"{{sfnp|Norena|1970|p=186|ps=}} He compared learning and gaining knowledge to how humans digest food.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=220|ps=}} Feeding the mind with knowledge is the same as feeding the body with food; it is essential to the human being.{{sfnp|Clements|1967|p=221|ps=}}\n\n==Major works==\n\n*''Opuscula varia ''(1519), collection of small works include Vives' first philosophical works, ''De initiis, sectis et laudibus philosophiae''.\n*''Adversus pseudodialecticos ''(1520)\n*''De subventione pauperum.
