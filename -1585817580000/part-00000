It is operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC), a subsidiary of [[BTS Group Holdings]], under a concession granted by the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA). The system consists of 48 stations along two lines: the [[Sukhumvit Line]] running northwards and south-eastwards, terminating at [[Kasetsart University BTS station|Kasetsart University]] and [[Kheha BTS station|Kheha]] respectively. The [[Silom Line]] which serves Silom and Sathon Roads, the central business district of Bangkok, terminates at [[National Stadium BTS station|National Stadium]] and [[Bang Wa BTS station|Bang Wa]]. The lines interchange at [[Siam BTS station|Siam station]] and have a combined [[Network length (transport)|route length]] of {{convert|53.5|km|mi|sp=us}}. The system is formally known as \"the Elevated Train in Commemoration of HM the King's 6th Cycle Birthday\" ({{lang|th|\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e09\u0e25\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e15\u0e34 6 \u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e29\u0e32}}).\n\nBesides the BTS, [[Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region|Bangkok's rapid transit system]] includes the underground and elevated [[MRT (Bangkok)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) railway lines, the [[Bangkok BRT|Bus Rapid Transit System]] (BRT), and the elevated [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] (ARL), serving several stations in the city before reaching [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].\nDos \nA veces da un\u00ed emplomo \nElsazuniga\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bkk masstransit 2020 clear version english wiki-01.png|thumb|Map of Bangkok urban transit systems]]\n[[File:Sky Train Silom Bangkok Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Skytrain departing [[Sala Daeng BTS station|Sala Daeng station]]]]\n[[File:Bangkok Skytrain interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of a train]]\n[[File:Bts-station-bangkok-large.jpg|thumb|A typical BTS station platform, showing platform screen doors]]\nPlans for mass transit in Bangkok began in the early-1980s. An early version of the Skytrain project was known as the [[Lavalin Skytrain]] because it was designed using the [[Vancouver SkyTrain]] as a model, adopting technology developed by [[SNC-Lavalin]]. Due to political interference, the concession with Lavalin was cancelled in June 1992,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=UMlFNn9pcEIC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=lavalin+skytrain+cancelled+1992&source=bl&ots=yp9XkX1VyY&sig=jOz0QJLg92dEsU9O7qWm-YZc3YI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=lavalin%20skytrain%20cancelled%201992&f=false|title=Building Social Capital in Thailand: Fibers, Finance and Infrastructure|last=Unger|first=Danny|date=1998-09-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521639316|language=en}}</ref> despite Bangkok's chronic [[traffic congestion]]. The [[Government of Thailand|Thai Government]] focused on increasing road and [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] [[infrastructure]] in an attempt to reduce the congestion. This had little impact as the number of cars on the road continued to increase dramatically. The routes considered as part of the Skytrain project would become the basis for the [[MRT (Bangkok)|MRT system]] and are mainly underground. In the early-1990s, foundations and a viaduct for the Lavalin Skytrain were constructed in the middle of the [[Phra Pok Klao Bridge]] across the [[Chao Phraya River]]. The planned metro bridge remains unused but may become part of the MRT's future [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]].\n\nAnother abortive attempt at building an elevated rail network was the [[Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System]] (BERTS), which was terminated in 1998 after only 13.77 percent had been completed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/14/business/worldbusiness/thais-revisit-a-troubled-masstransit-project.html|title=Thais Revisit a Troubled Mass-Transit Project|last=Tribune|first=Thomas Crampton|date=1998-10-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>\n\nShortly after it became clear that the Lavalin Skytrain had stalled, then-[[Governor of Bangkok|Governor]] Major General [[Chamlong Srimuang]] asked his deputy, Captain [[Kritsada Arunwong na Ayutthaya]], to create a new feeder system with a route along [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] and [[Silom Road]]s. Krisda and his team from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) succeeded in finding a private investor. Krisda also convinced everyone concerned to allow the city supervise the project. [[Keeree Kanjanapas]] founded the Bangkok Transit System Corporation (BTSC) and it successfully financed the system and grew it from a feeder system to a full mass transit project. Thanayong Public Company Limited ({{SET|TYONG}},<ref name=\"TYONG\">{{cite web |url=http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/about_us_history.php |title=Our History |publisher=BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited|accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> {{lang-th|\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e29\u0e31\u0e17 \u0e18\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e07 \u0e08\u0e33\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14 (\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19)}}) had a 28 percent stake in BTSC when the Skytrain began, and therefore in its early days the system was sometimes referred to as the \"Thanayong Skytrain\".\n\n[[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]], the supplier of the railway technology, and the Thai contractor, Italian Thai Development, built the system for BTSC. The \"Skytrain\" name was bestowed later by the press following the Vancouver example where the elevated metro had been named \"Skytrain\". Originally, the Skytrain depot was to be built underneath [[Lumphini Park]], but due to widespread objections from Bangkok residents it was constructed on a parcel of land on [[Phahonyothin Road]], replacing the old northern/northeastern bus terminal ([[Mo Chit Bus Terminal|Mo Chit]]). The current depot at Mo Chit is part of the proposed \"Bangkok Terminal\" project, where a large complex composed of a new regional bus terminal, [[park and ride]] facility, and other commercial development can be built directly above it.\n\nThe Skytrain system was opened on 5 December 1999<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/world/bangkok-opens-skytrain-but-will-it-ease-car-traffic.html|title=Bangkok Opens Skytrain, but Will It Ease Car Traffic?|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=1999-12-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref> by Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]]. It initially had lower-than-predicted ridership, with 200,000 passenger trips per day. Ticket revenue was only enough to meet the trains' operating cost, and not sufficient to service construction loans.  The Skytrain's daily passenger numbers have steadily increased since then. On 9 December 2005, more than 500,000 single trips were made on the Skytrain on a single day for the first time. By September 2012, the Skytrain served around 600,000 passengers on an average day, increasing to 650,000 on an average weekday in 2013. A record 760,000 passengers traveled on Sunday, 22 December 2013, a day of mass political protest in Bangkok.<ref>'Trains gain as rallies clog roads', ''Bangkok Post'', 26 December 2013</ref> The normal Sunday average is 400,000 passengers.

Construction began on 13 December 2005 with completion originally expected within two years. However, problems with the tendering and installation of a new Bombardier open signalling system repeatedly pushed back the schedule. The extension finally opening on 15 May 2009. However, the single platform [[Saphan Taksin BTS station|Saphan Taksin station]] which has only one track, has caused repeated delays during rush hour. In 2012, the BMA announced plans to demolish Saphan Taksin station in the future. There are now plans to construct new platforms and remove the bottleneck and keep the station which provides an important link between river boats. The plan includes redesigning the road bridges either side of the viaduct to fit the new station.\n\n===2nd extension - Sukhumvit Line, east===\nA second extension, the 5.25&nbsp;km On Nut station (E09) to Bearing station (E14) started construction in August 2006.<ref>Groundbreaking starts on new BTS extension, ''Daily News'', 15 August 2006</ref> The 4 billion baht extension was again funded by the BMA.<ref>BTS extension budget cut, ''Bangkok Post'', 15 December 2006</ref> The original scheduled opening date was mid-2009.

Subsequently, the extension did not open until over two years later on 12 August 2011. The delay in opening prompted the BMA to offer free travel for this extension until the end of 2011 as compensation. A flat fare is charged for this section. The fee for this extension is separate from the distance based fare of the rest of the BTS network.\n\n===3rd extension - Silom Line, south===\nThe third extension to the network, a 5.3&nbsp;km, four station extension from Wongwian Yai (S8) to Bang Wa (S12) in Phasi Charoen District began construction in the 2nd quarter of 2011 with a deadline of the end of 2012. Only the stations had to be constructed as the viaduct had been completed some years prior. However, construction was delayed for many months by the Bangkok floods of late 2011. It eventually opened in stages.

Public announcements are spoken by actress Ratklao Amaradit. The power supply for all trains is at 750 V DC from the [[third rail]].\n\n===Siemens train===\n====First order (EMU-A)====\n[[File:Bangkok Skytrain exterior.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Siemens Modular Metro]] train (EMU-A1)]]\nThe rolling stock of BTS Skytrain, in use when the line opened in 1999, consisted of 35 [[Siemens Modular Metro]] trains from [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]]. These initial trains had three cars, two motor cars and one trailer in the center. The Sukhumvit Line used 20 trains, and the Silom Line had 15.\n\nAfter the 12 new car CNR trains were delivered for the Silom line in December 2010, the 15 Siemens trains on the Silom Line were transferred to the Sukhumvit Line.\n\n====Second order: extra cars to expand to four-car train operations (EMU-A)====\nTo increase capacity, in October 2010, BTSC ordered an extra 35 single cars from Siemens to make each train a four car set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/news/bangkoks-skytrain-increases-train-fleet.html |title=Bangkok's Skytrain increases train fleet |journal=[[International Railway Journal]] |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Nareerat |last=Wiriyapong |title=Sukhumvit BTS line to get four-car trains in October |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/transport/309806/sukhumvit-bts-line-to-get-four-car-trains-in-october |newspaper=Bangkok Post |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThese extra cars were progressively introduced into operation from November 2012 to March 2013, when all 35 sets of Siemens rolling stock finally became four car sets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/commu_news_detail.php?id=80 |title=News & Events - BTS takes delivery of new train cars from SIEMENS |publisher=BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>\n\nThe Silom Line cars have been modified to support a signaling system from [[Bombardier Transportation]] since the extension from [[Saphan Taksin Station|Saphan Taksin]] to [[Wong Wian Yai]].\n\n====Third order: new four-car sets for extension operations (EMU-A2)====\n[[File:Bts-siemens-inspiro-emu-a2-2.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Siemens Inspiro]] (EMU-A2) Rolling Stock]]\nTo serve the Sukhumvit Line Extension (East) BTSC ordered 22 new [[Siemens Inspiro]] four-car trains from a consortium of [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]] and [http://www.bozankaya.de/new_site/en/page&id=1000&navid=12 Bozankaya] in May 2016.<ref name=MRI200516>[https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/bangkok-mts-to-order-siemens-and-crrc-trains.html Siemens and CRRC trains for Bangkok] ''[[Metro Report International]]'' 20 May 2016</ref>\n\nThese trains were manufactured in the Bozankaya factory in Ankara, [[Turkey]]. Siemens supplied bogies, traction, braking and auxiliary systems and was responsible for project management, development, construction and commissioning of the trains.

Their design was modified to the existing BTS's Siemens Modular Metro. The new trains were delivered late and only began service the Silom Line in December 2010. This was some 18 months after the [[Wong Wian Yai]] and [[Krung Thonburi Station|Krung Thonburi]] stations were opened in May 2009 during which time there was severe overcrowding on the Silom line.\n\nThese trains consist of two-motor cars and two-trailer cars (i.e., four-car trainsets) and feature LCD TVs for public announcements and advertising. An advanced digital voice announcement (DVA) and passenger information systems was installed.\n\n====Second order (EMU-B2)====\nIn September 2011, the BTSC ordered five more four-car trainsets of CNR rolling stock for 1.5 billion baht to prepare for the Silom Line extension to [[Bang Wa BTS Station|Bang Wa]] which was then due to open in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/telecom/258787/more-4-car-trains-on-bts-shopping-list |title=More 4-car trains on BTS shopping list |work=The Bangkok Post |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> These five new train sets of rolling stock entered service on 29 November 2013 after the first two stations of the Silom Line extension to Bang Wa opened in January and February 2013, respectively.

Passengers Information Display)\n\n==Ridership==\nThe first years of operations saw limited ridership. The line had few direct ramps into malls and lacked escalators. Little by little, while escalators were installed and side bridges added, patronage increased. The opening of [[Siam Paragon]] Mall in 2004, at the time Thailand's most luxurious mall, boosted crowds at the system's central Siam station. The redevelopment of the [[Ratchaprasong]] and [[Siam]] districts as well as new \"skywalks\" fostered growing accessibility.\n\nRidership grew steadily with incremental expansion of the lines, and at peak hour, the trains sometimes depart without being able to take all waiting passengers. Average daily ridership first surpassed 200,000 in June 2001, 300,000 in November 2003, 400,000 in March 2006, 500,000 in August 2011, 600,000 in August 2013 and 700,000 in November 2017.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 10em;\"\n|-\n| {{Graph:BTS Skytrain ridership}}\n|-\n| class=\"thumbcaption\" | Average daily ridership on the BTS Skytrain 2006\u20132018.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n|}\n\n===Ridership statistics ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n!Total ridership\n!Average daily ridership\n|-\n|1999\n|4,585,743\n|169,842\n|-\n|2000\n|55,092,671\n|150,469\n|-\n|2001\n|74,025,652\n|202,685\n|-\n|2002\n|93,493,981\n|256,033\n|-\n|2003\n|102,348,697\n|280,379\n|-\n|2004\n|115,681,448\n|316,068\n|-\n|2005\n|127,350,084\n|348,795\n|-\n|2006\n|140,048,849\n|383,635\n|-\n|2007\n|132,070,502\n|361,977\n|-\n|2008\n|136,350,007\n|372,551\n|-\n|2009\n|140,957,969\n|386,145\n|-\n|2010\n|143,102,971\n|392,376\n|-\n|2011\n|167,348,070\n|458,275\n|-\n|2012\n|194,113,068\n|530,422\n|-\n|2013\n|208,764,971\n|571,855\n|-\n|2014\n|219,422,367\n|598,984\n|-\n|2015\n|229,853,593\n|629,218\n|-\n|2016\n|237,047,435\n|647,752\n|-\n|2017\n|241,067,194\n|657,784\n|-\n|2018\n|240,139,471\n|658,123\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" | Busiest stations<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prachachat.net/prachachat-top-story/news-145681|title=\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e42\u0e1c\u0e17\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e2a \"\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21-\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01-\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15\" \u0e17\u0e30\u0e25\u0e38\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e04\u0e19|website=|language=Thai|trans-title=Revealed!

It is operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC), a subsidiary of [[BTS Group Holdings]], under a concession granted by the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA). The system consists of 48 stations along two lines: the [[Sukhumvit Line]] running northwards and south-eastwards, terminating at [[Kasetsart University BTS station|Kasetsart University]] and [[Kheha BTS station|Kheha]] respectively. The [[Silom Line]] which serves Silom and Sathon Roads, the central business district of Bangkok, terminates at [[National Stadium BTS station|National Stadium]] and [[Bang Wa BTS station|Bang Wa]]. The lines interchange at [[Siam BTS station|Siam station]] and have a combined [[Network length (transport)|route length]] of {{convert|53.5|km|mi|sp=us}}. The system is formally known as \"the Elevated Train in Commemoration of HM the King's 6th Cycle Birthday\" ({{lang|th|\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e09\u0e25\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e15\u0e34 6 \u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e29\u0e32}}).\n\nBesides the BTS, [[Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region|Bangkok's rapid transit system]] includes the underground and elevated [[MRT (Bangkok)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) railway lines, the [[Bangkok BRT|Bus Rapid Transit System]] (BRT), and the elevated [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] (ARL), serving several stations in the city before reaching [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bkk masstransit 2020 clear version english wiki-01.png|thumb|Map of Bangkok urban transit systems]]\n[[File:Sky Train Silom Bangkok Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Skytrain departing [[Sala Daeng BTS station|Sala Daeng station]]]]\n[[File:Bangkok Skytrain interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of a train]]\n[[File:Bts-station-bangkok-large.jpg|thumb|A typical BTS station platform, showing platform screen doors]]\nPlans for mass transit in Bangkok began in the early-1980s. An early version of the Skytrain project was known as the [[Lavalin Skytrain]] because it was designed using the [[Vancouver SkyTrain]] as a model, adopting technology developed by [[SNC-Lavalin]]. Due to political interference, the concession with Lavalin was cancelled in June 1992,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=UMlFNn9pcEIC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=lavalin+skytrain+cancelled+1992&source=bl&ots=yp9XkX1VyY&sig=jOz0QJLg92dEsU9O7qWm-YZc3YI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=lavalin%20skytrain%20cancelled%201992&f=false|title=Building Social Capital in Thailand: Fibers, Finance and Infrastructure|last=Unger|first=Danny|date=1998-09-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521639316|language=en}}</ref> despite Bangkok's chronic [[traffic congestion]]. The [[Government of Thailand|Thai Government]] focused on increasing road and [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] [[infrastructure]] in an attempt to reduce the congestion. This had little impact as the number of cars on the road continued to increase dramatically. The routes considered as part of the Skytrain project would become the basis for the [[MRT (Bangkok)|MRT system]] and are mainly underground. In the early-1990s, foundations and a viaduct for the Lavalin Skytrain were constructed in the middle of the [[Phra Pok Klao Bridge]] across the [[Chao Phraya River]]. The planned metro bridge remains unused but may become part of the MRT's future [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]].\n\nAnother abortive attempt at building an elevated rail network was the [[Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System]] (BERTS), which was terminated in 1998 after only 13.77 percent had been completed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/14/business/worldbusiness/thais-revisit-a-troubled-masstransit-project.html|title=Thais Revisit a Troubled Mass-Transit Project|last=Tribune|first=Thomas Crampton|date=1998-10-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>\n\nShortly after it became clear that the Lavalin Skytrain had stalled, then-[[Governor of Bangkok|Governor]] Major General [[Chamlong Srimuang]] asked his deputy, Captain [[Kritsada Arunwong na Ayutthaya]], to create a new feeder system with a route along [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] and [[Silom Road]]s. Krisda and his team from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) succeeded in finding a private investor. Krisda also convinced everyone concerned to allow the city supervise the project. [[Keeree Kanjanapas]] founded the Bangkok Transit System Corporation (BTSC) and it successfully financed the system and grew it from a feeder system to a full mass transit project. Thanayong Public Company Limited ({{SET|TYONG}},<ref name=\"TYONG\">{{cite web |url=http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/about_us_history.php |title=Our History |publisher=BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited|accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> {{lang-th|\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e29\u0e31\u0e17 \u0e18\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e07 \u0e08\u0e33\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14 (\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19)}}) had a 28 percent stake in BTSC when the Skytrain began, and therefore in its early days the system was sometimes referred to as the \"Thanayong Skytrain\".\n\n[[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]], the supplier of the railway technology, and the Thai contractor, Italian Thai Development, built the system for BTSC. The \"Skytrain\" name was bestowed later by the press following the Vancouver example where the elevated metro had been named \"Skytrain\". Originally, the Skytrain depot was to be built underneath [[Lumphini Park]], but due to widespread objections from Bangkok residents it was constructed on a parcel of land on [[Phahonyothin Road]], replacing the old northern/northeastern bus terminal ([[Mo Chit Bus Terminal|Mo Chit]]). The current depot at Mo Chit is part of the proposed \"Bangkok Terminal\" project, where a large complex composed of a new regional bus terminal, [[park and ride]] facility, and other commercial development can be built directly above it.\n\nThe Skytrain system was opened on 5 December 1999<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/world/bangkok-opens-skytrain-but-will-it-ease-car-traffic.html|title=Bangkok Opens Skytrain, but Will It Ease Car Traffic?|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=1999-12-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref> by Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]]. It initially had lower-than-predicted ridership, with 200,000 passenger trips per day. Ticket revenue was only enough to meet the trains' operating cost, and not sufficient to service construction loans.  The Skytrain's daily passenger numbers have steadily increased since then. On 9 December 2005, more than 500,000 single trips were made on the Skytrain on a single day for the first time. By September 2012, the Skytrain served around 600,000 passengers on an average day, increasing to 650,000 on an average weekday in 2013. A record 760,000 passengers traveled on Sunday, 22 December 2013, a day of mass political protest in Bangkok.<ref>'Trains gain as rallies clog roads', ''Bangkok Post'', 26 December 2013</ref> The normal Sunday average is 400,000 passengers.

Construction began on 13 December 2005 with completion originally expected within two years. However, problems with the tendering and installation of a new Bombardier open signalling system repeatedly pushed back the schedule. The extension finally opening on 15 May 2009. However, the single platform [[Saphan Taksin BTS station|Saphan Taksin station]] which has only one track, has caused repeated delays during rush hour. In 2012, the BMA announced plans to demolish Saphan Taksin station in the future. There are now plans to construct new platforms and remove the bottleneck and keep the station which provides an important link between river boats. The plan includes redesigning the road bridges either side of the viaduct to fit the new station.\n\n===2nd extension - Sukhumvit Line, east===\nA second extension, the 5.25&nbsp;km On Nut station (E09) to Bearing station (E14) started construction in August 2006.<ref>Groundbreaking starts on new BTS extension, ''Daily News'', 15 August 2006</ref> The 4 billion baht extension was again funded by the BMA.<ref>BTS extension budget cut, ''Bangkok Post'', 15 December 2006</ref> The original scheduled opening date was mid-2009.

Subsequently, the extension did not open until over two years later on 12 August 2011. The delay in opening prompted the BMA to offer free travel for this extension until the end of 2011 as compensation. A flat fare is charged for this section.

However, this may also be built as a light rail (monorail) line.\n\n===Silom Line, south===\nAfter the opening of S11 & S12 on 5 December 2013, the BMA announced a new proposal to further extended the Silom Line by 7&nbsp;km from [[Bang Wa BTS station|Bang Wa (S12) station]], by six stations to Taling Chan, where it would connect with the [[SRT Light Red Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/region/387159|title=\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e1f\u0e23\u0e35 1 \u0e40\u0e14\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19 \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19-\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e49\u0e32|accessdate=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIf approved, the proposed time frame would be for completion of design by 2015. Construction would be undertaken from 2016-2018 for a planned 2019 opening. Part of the basis for this further extension by the BMA is that it would provide proximate access to the Southern Bus Terminal. This proposal is currently under preliminary study by the BMA.\n\n===Silom Line, west===\nThe Silom Line is planned to be extended by one or two stations west along Rama 1 from National Stadium (W1) to link with the [[SRT Dark Red Line]] at Yot Se station. However, no time frame for this extension has been announced and this section of the Dark Red Line will not be built until further notice.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to extend the Silom Line west from National Stadium into Chinatown, then north to Democracy Monument where it would then run west to Rattanakosin Island and Sanum Luang, tunnel under the river to the Thonburi side before terminating at Phran Nok. However, this plan was shelved in 2009 and much of this route has been replaced by routing changes to the planned [[MRT Orange Line]].\n{{clear}}\n\nBTS Group Holdings will be bidding to manage more BTS and MRT lines in the future through financing built out of its BTS Rail Mass Transit Growth Infrastructure Fund after it got approval from the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2013.

Public announcements are spoken by actress Ratklao Amaradit.

Their design was modified to the existing BTS's Siemens Modular Metro. The new trains were delivered late and only began service the Silom Line in December 2010. This was some 18 months after the [[Wong Wian Yai]] and [[Krung Thonburi Station|Krung Thonburi]] stations were opened in May 2009 during which time there was severe overcrowding on the Silom line.\n\nThese trains consist of two-motor cars and two-trailer cars (i.e., four-car trainsets) and feature LCD TVs for public announcements and advertising. An advanced digital voice announcement (DVA) and passenger information systems was installed.\n\n====Second order (EMU-B2)====\nIn September 2011, the BTSC ordered five more four-car trainsets of CNR rolling stock for 1.5 billion baht to prepare for the Silom Line extension to [[Bang Wa BTS Station|Bang Wa]] which was then due to open in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/telecom/258787/more-4-car-trains-on-bts-shopping-list |title=More 4-car trains on BTS shopping list |work=The Bangkok Post |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> These five new train sets of rolling stock entered service on 29 November 2013 after the first two stations of the Silom Line extension to Bang Wa opened in January and February 2013, respectively.

Passengers Information Display)\n\n==Ridership==\nThe first years of operations saw limited ridership. The line had few direct ramps into malls and lacked escalators. Little by little, while escalators were installed and side bridges added, patronage increased. The opening of [[Siam Paragon]] Mall in 2004, at the time Thailand's most luxurious mall, boosted crowds at the system's central Siam station. The redevelopment of the [[Ratchaprasong]] and [[Siam]] districts as well as new \"skywalks\" fostered growing accessibility.\n\nRidership grew steadily with incremental expansion of the lines, and at peak hour, the trains sometimes depart without being able to take all waiting passengers. Average daily ridership first surpassed 200,000 in June 2001, 300,000 in November 2003, 400,000 in March 2006, 500,000 in August 2011, 600,000 in August 2013 and 700,000 in November 2017.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 10em;\"\n|-\n| {{Graph:BTS Skytrain ridership}}\n|-\n| class=\"thumbcaption\" | Average daily ridership on the BTS Skytrain 2006\u20132018.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n|}\n\n===Ridership statistics ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n!Total ridership\n!Average daily ridership\n|-\n|1999\n|4,585,743\n|169,842\n|-\n|2000\n|55,092,671\n|150,469\n|-\n|2001\n|74,025,652\n|202,685\n|-\n|2002\n|93,493,981\n|256,033\n|-\n|2003\n|102,348,697\n|280,379\n|-\n|2004\n|115,681,448\n|316,068\n|-\n|2005\n|127,350,084\n|348,795\n|-\n|2006\n|140,048,849\n|383,635\n|-\n|2007\n|132,070,502\n|361,977\n|-\n|2008\n|136,350,007\n|372,551\n|-\n|2009\n|140,957,969\n|386,145\n|-\n|2010\n|143,102,971\n|392,376\n|-\n|2011\n|167,348,070\n|458,275\n|-\n|2012\n|194,113,068\n|530,422\n|-\n|2013\n|208,764,971\n|571,855\n|-\n|2014\n|219,422,367\n|598,984\n|-\n|2015\n|229,853,593\n|629,218\n|-\n|2016\n|237,047,435\n|647,752\n|-\n|2017\n|241,067,194\n|657,784\n|-\n|2018\n|240,139,471\n|658,123\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" | Busiest stations<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prachachat.net/prachachat-top-story/news-145681|title=\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e42\u0e1c\u0e17\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e2a \"\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21-\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01-\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15\" \u0e17\u0e30\u0e25\u0e38\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e04\u0e19|website=|language=Thai|trans-title=Revealed!

The album features a broader spectrum of musical styles than the band's previous albums, ranging from some of their heaviest compositions to moody [[trip hop]] and [[shoegaze]] influences, with some songs recorded mostly with [[seven-string guitar]]s. It was the band's final album to be produced by [[Terry Date]], whose collaboration with Deftones dated back to their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' (1995).\n\n==Background==\nOriginally titled ''Lovers'', the album was instead given an eponymous title because singer [[Chino Moreno]] considered ''Lovers'' too obvious in relation to the context of its material (the former title song \"Lovers\" did appear as an [[A-side and B-side]] on the UK \"[[Hexagram (song)|Hexagram]]\" single). ''Deftones'' was the last album produced by Date, who had collaborated with the band since ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'', due to the vast amount of time spent in the studio. The band's slow writing and recording pace frustrated Date, as well as their lack of previously composed material when they entered the studio. A leaked track list from a month prior to the album's release featured \"Needles & Pins\" as the opener, under the title \"Aria\"; The song title and the album's track list were changed at the last minute.\n\n==Musical style==\n''Deftones'' is an eclectic album, with songs spanning many different ideas in diverse genres. It has a much different feel than prior efforts, due in part to [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] leaving his [[turntables]] behind and instead focusing on playing [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. Most of the album's songs make extensive use of the band's low G# tuning and Moreno's high screams, resulting in some of the heaviest songs in the band's catalog. On the other hand, the track \"Lucky You\" is a dark, soft, [[trip hop]]-influenced piece featuring DJ Crook from Moreno's side project [[Team Sleep]] and vocalist [[Rey Osburn]] of [[Tinfed]]. A [[grand piano]] and [[toy piano]] were featured in the mournful \"Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event.\"\n\nIn addition to [[trip-hop]] influences, significant [[shoegaze]] elements have been noted on the album, especially in regards to the song \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]].\".<ref name=\"cos\">{{cite magazine | url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/the-top-20-deftones-songs/2/ | title=The Top 20 Deftones Songs | magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]] | accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"spinmag\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Andrew|title=The SPIN Interview: Deftones|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/spin-interview-deftones-gore-new-album/|website=SPIN|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite web|last1=Gormely|first1=Ian|title=Deftones: Beauty and Brutality|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/deftones-beauty_and_brutality|website=Exclaim!|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\n''Deftones'' produced two [[single (music)|singles]], \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]]\" and \"Hexagram.\" [[Music video]]s were shot for both singles as well as the track \"Bloody Cape\". The latter's video was only available on the band's official [[website]] for one day, but was later released on the DVD portion of the band's ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]''.

The album features a broader spectrum of musical styles than the band's previous albums, ranging from some of their heaviest compositions to moody [[trip hop]] and [[shoegaze]] influences, with some songs recorded mostly with [[seven-string guitar]]s. It was the band's final album to be produced by [[Terry Date]], whose collaboration with Deftones dated back to their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' (1995).\n\n==Background==\nOriginally titled ''Lovers'', the album was instead given an eponymous title because singer [[Chino Moreno]] considered ''Lovers'' too obvious in relation to the context of its material (the former title song \"Lovers\" did appear as an [[A-side and B-side]] on the UK \"[[Hexagram (song)|Hexagram]]\" single). ''Deftones'' was the last album produced by Date, who had collaborated with the band since ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'', due to the vast amount of time spent in the studio. The band's slow writing and recording pace frustrated Date, as well as their lack of previously composed material when they entered the studio. A leaked track list from a month prior to the album's release featured \"Needles & Pins\" as the opener, under the title \"Aria\"; The song title and the album's track list were changed at the last minute.\n\n==Musical style==\n''Deftones'' is an eclectic album, with songs spanning many different ideas in diverse genres. It has a much different feel than prior efforts, due in part to [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] leaving his [[turntables]] behind and instead focusing on playing [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[synthesizer]]s. Most of the album's songs make extensive use of the band's low G# tuning and Moreno's high screams, resulting in some of the heaviest songs in the band's catalog. On the other hand, the track \"Lucky You\" is a dark, soft, [[trip hop]]-influenced piece featuring DJ Crook from Moreno's side project [[Team Sleep]] and vocalist [[Rey Osburn]] of [[Tinfed]]. A [[grand piano]] and [[toy piano]] were featured in the mournful \"Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event.\"\n\nIn addition to [[trip-hop]] influences, significant [[shoegaze]] elements have been noted on the album, especially in regards to the song \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]].\".<ref name=\"cos\">{{cite magazine | url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/04/the-top-20-deftones-songs/2/ | title=The Top 20 Deftones Songs | magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]] | accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"spinmag\">{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Andrew|title=The SPIN Interview: Deftones|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/spin-interview-deftones-gore-new-album/|website=SPIN|accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite web|last1=Gormely|first1=Ian|title=Deftones: Beauty and Brutality|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/deftones-beauty_and_brutality|website=Exclaim!|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\n''Deftones'' produced two [[single (music)|singles]], \"[[Minerva (song)|Minerva]]\" and \"Hexagram.\" [[Music video]]s were shot for both singles as well as the track \"Bloody Cape\". The latter's video was only available on the band's official [[website]] for one day, but was later released on the DVD portion of the band's ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]''.

He was a Knight of the [[National Order of Merit (France)|French National Order of Merit]] in 1991.\n\n==Biography==\nBidermann was born in [[Anderlecht]]. Being Jewish, he lived along with his sister Evelyne from 1941 to 1943 with a Christian family in [[Aix-en-Provence]]; while his sister [[R\u00e9gine Zylberberg|Regina]] was hidden in a convent. In 1943, the [[Germany|German]] police detained him and he was sent to a clinic in [[Bandol]] due to health problems. In 1946, Maurice Zylberberg arrived in [[Paris]]. In 1948 he left Paris and\u00a0voyaged to [[Israel]] and joined the [[Israel Defense Forces]] for 18 months but returned to France to work in a food factory. In April 1950, he entered the business of textiles and clothing of his uncle George Bidermann. Bidermann quickly introduced new technical manufacturing processes and personnel management revolutionizing the textile industry. These innovations allowed the company Bidermann to reach a production level unrivaled in [[Europe]], paving the way for export. In 1966 he signed an agreement with the [[Soviet Union]]  on 310,000 menswear. In France, the Bidermann group then had the licensing models menswear brands [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Daniel Hechter]], [[Daniel Cremieux]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges]]. In the [[United States]], the Bidermann Group acquired the brandsand?[[Calvin Klein]] sportswear men, and [[Ralph Lauren]] women's wear. The family business that employed 60 people in 1950 became twenty-five years later an industry group of some thirty factories employing about 18,000 people across the world (12,000 foreign and 6,000 in Europe).\n\nThe [[Iraq War]] and new competition disrupted the growth of Bidermann Group experiencing difficulties that required it to restructure its production, both French and [[United States|American]]. Maurice Bidermann preferred to save jobs and tried to revive the group through acquisitions in the 1990s including the farm's brands [[Burberry]], [[Cluett Peabody & Company|Arrow]] and [[Gold Toe Brands|Gold Toe]] licenses. However in 1995 Maurice  Bidermann was forced to cede part of his French group to the Deveaux Group.\n\n===Elf Case===\nBidermann was sentenced to three years in prison, two suspended and fined one million [[euro]]s for the leaders of \"abuse of corporate assets, the misuse of corporate assets to expense Elf, presenting false accounts \"and\" spreading false information \"on the consolidated statements of Bidermann group\" in 1992.<ref name=bidermann>{{cite web|title=Maurice Bidermann|url=http://www.engagingnews.us/select/Maurice-Bidermann.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122607/http://www.engagingnews.us/select/Maurice-Bidermann.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2014|publisher=EngagingNews.US|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMaurice Bidermann contributed to the development of the spirit of cooperation between the Israeli and [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] peoples such as supporting [[NGO]]s like [[Action against Hunger]], or the [[National Museum, Warsaw|Museum of Warsaw]] in [[Poland]], the country of origin of his parents. In 1974 he created the ''Association of Friends of French university AFBGU'' ([[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]]), the development of a program between Jewish and [[Muslim]] students at the [[University of Haifa]], development and training of mediators and a training school for teachers at the [[Tel Aviv University|University of Tel Aviv]], the creation of the ''Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Israeli Raymond Leven'' in [[Tel Aviv]] or the granting of micro-credits for projects involving Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n==Personal life==\nMaurice Bidermann was married to Danielle Bibas, born 11 December 1940 in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]].

In 1948 he left Paris and\u00a0voyaged to [[Israel]] and joined the [[Israel Defense Forces]] for 18 months but returned to France to work in a food factory. In April 1950, he entered the business of textiles and clothing of his uncle George Bidermann. Bidermann quickly introduced new technical manufacturing processes and personnel management revolutionizing the textile industry. These innovations allowed the company Bidermann to reach a production level unrivaled in [[Europe]], paving the way for export. In 1966 he signed an agreement with the [[Soviet Union]]  on 310,000 menswear. In France, the Bidermann group then had the licensing models menswear brands [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Daniel Hechter]], [[Daniel Cremieux]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges]]. In the [[United States]], the Bidermann Group acquired the brandsand?[[Calvin Klein]] sportswear men, and [[Ralph Lauren]] women's wear. The family business that employed 60 people in 1950 became twenty-five years later an industry group of some thirty factories employing about 18,000 people across the world (12,000 foreign and 6,000 in Europe).\n\nThe [[Iraq War]] and new competition disrupted the growth of Bidermann Group experiencing difficulties that required it to restructure its production, both French and [[United States|American]]. Maurice Bidermann preferred to save jobs and tried to revive the group through acquisitions in the 1990s including the farm's brands [[Burberry]], [[Cluett Peabody & Company|Arrow]] and [[Gold Toe Brands|Gold Toe]] licenses. However in 1995 Maurice  Bidermann was forced to cede part of his French group to the Deveaux Group.\n\n===Elf Case===\nBidermann was sentenced to three years in prison, two suspended and fined one million [[euro]]s for the leaders of \"abuse of corporate assets, the misuse of corporate assets to expense Elf, presenting false accounts \"and\" spreading false information \"on the consolidated statements of Bidermann group\" in 1992.<ref name=bidermann>{{cite web|title=Maurice Bidermann|url=http://www.engagingnews.us/select/Maurice-Bidermann.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122607/http://www.engagingnews.us/select/Maurice-Bidermann.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2014|publisher=EngagingNews.US|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMaurice Bidermann contributed to the development of the spirit of cooperation between the Israeli and [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] peoples such as supporting [[NGO]]s like [[Action against Hunger]], or the [[National Museum, Warsaw|Museum of Warsaw]] in [[Poland]], the country of origin of his parents. In 1974 he created the ''Association of Friends of French university AFBGU'' ([[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]]), the development of a program between Jewish and [[Muslim]] students at the [[University of Haifa]], development and training of mediators and a training school for teachers at the [[Tel Aviv University|University of Tel Aviv]], the creation of the ''Lyc\u00e9e Franco-Israeli Raymond Leven'' in [[Tel Aviv]] or the granting of micro-credits for projects involving Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n==Personal life==\nMaurice Bidermann was married to Danielle Bibas, born 11 December 1940 in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]].

Robert's mother, John's wife and cousin, was Mary or Margaret Barnewall (died 1771), daughter of [[Sir John Barnewall (Recorder of Dublin)|Sir John Barnewall]], [[Recorder of Dublin]] and Thomasine Preston.  Robert had two surviving younger brothers, including the short-lived soldier [[Anthony Barnewall]], all three being educated privately. Robert travelled abroad extensively in his youth, studying [[botany]] and [[medicine]].<ref name=\"ODNB\">O'Brien (2004)</ref>\n\n==Return to Ireland==\nBarnewall returned home to Trimlestown Castle in [[Ireland]] in 1746 when he inherited his title and quickly became known for his stylish living and hospitality, extending to generous help to local poor people.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nBy 1746, Catholics in Ireland were wholly [[Suffrage|disenfranchised]] by a series of acts of policy of the [[British government]] (''see [[Ireland 1691\u20131801#The Penal Laws|Ireland 1691\u20131801: The Penal Laws]]''). Barnewall saw himself as an inheritor of the [[Hiberno-Norman]] establishment but, by the mid 18th century, agitation in the Catholic cause had shifted from the gentry to the rising [[merchant]] and [[profession]]al classes. Thus, in 1759, Barnewall split with the mercantile Catholics and mounted his own reform campaign but with little initial success. An offer that Catholics enlist in the [[armed forces]] was rebuffed in 1762, a humiliation compounded when his son [[Thomas Barnewall, 13th Baron Trimlestown|Thomas]] converted to [[Protestant]]ism.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nBarnewall's return to politics in 1775 was marked by a more conciliatory approach to his fellow Catholics and he was crucial to a successful project to develop an [[oath of allegiance]] acceptable to the Catholic laity. Barnewall soon assumed the authority to speak for the entire Irish Catholic cause, including the ''[[Catholic Committee (Ireland)|Catholic Committee]]''.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWith the British government engaged by the [[American Revolutionary War]], Barnewall renewed his earlier offer of enlistment. The renewed offer was timely. The British government's [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which had granted concessions to Catholics in [[Quebec]], had been condemned by the revolutionaries, and the Irish Catholic community was experiencing a wave of pro-British establishment enthusiasm. However, such [[patriotism|patriotic]] fervour itself roused Protestant hostility in [[Dublin]]. Barnewall's intervention to moderate Catholic passion was admired both by the British government and his Catholic following.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nHis health deteriorating, his final political act was to head the list of signatories to the Catholic address of loyalty to the new [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] [[John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire]] in 1777. Barnewall died in Dublin and was buried at Trimlestown.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married three times:<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n#Margaret (died ''c.''1740), daughter of James Rochfort of [[Laragh, Kildare|Laragh]], [[County Kildare]];\n#Elizabeth, daughter of John Colt of [[Brightlingsea]]  and  his wife Elizabeth  Man (in or before 1757); and\n#Anne (died 1831), the fifth daughter of William Hervey of  [[London]] and his wife Elizabeth Barfoot.\n\nHe appears to have had at least four sons, though two died very young.

Barnewall saw himself as an inheritor of the [[Hiberno-Norman]] establishment but, by the mid 18th century, agitation in the Catholic cause had shifted from the gentry to the rising [[merchant]] and [[profession]]al classes. Thus, in 1759, Barnewall split with the mercantile Catholics and mounted his own reform campaign but with little initial success. An offer that Catholics enlist in the [[armed forces]] was rebuffed in 1762, a humiliation compounded when his son [[Thomas Barnewall, 13th Baron Trimlestown|Thomas]] converted to [[Protestant]]ism.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nBarnewall's return to politics in 1775 was marked by a more conciliatory approach to his fellow Catholics and he was crucial to a successful project to develop an [[oath of allegiance]] acceptable to the Catholic laity. Barnewall soon assumed the authority to speak for the entire Irish Catholic cause, including the ''[[Catholic Committee]]''.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWith the British government engaged by the [[American Revolutionary War]], Barnewall renewed his earlier offer of enlistment. The renewed offer was timely. The British government's [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which had granted concessions to Catholics in [[Quebec]], had been condemned by the revolutionaries, and the Irish Catholic community was experiencing a wave of pro-British establishment enthusiasm. However, such [[patriotism|patriotic]] fervour itself roused Protestant hostility in [[Dublin]]. Barnewall's intervention to moderate Catholic passion was admired both by the British government and his Catholic following.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nHis health deteriorating, his final political act was to head the list of signatories to the Catholic address of loyalty to the new [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] [[John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire]] in 1777. Barnewall died in Dublin and was buried at Trimlestown.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nHe married three times:<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n#Margaret (died ''c.''1740), daughter of James Rochfort of [[Laragh, Kildare|Laragh]], [[County Kildare]];\n#Elizabeth, daughter of John Colt of [[Brightlingsea]]  and  his wife Elizabeth  Man (in or before 1757); and\n#Anne (died 1831), the fifth daughter of William Hervey of  [[London]] and his wife Elizabeth Barfoot.\n\nHe appears to have had at least four sons, though two died very young. Two surviving sons, Thomas, and Mathias, adhered to the [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]].<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He had at  least one daughter Bridget, who married Robert Martin FitzAnthony: they were the parents of the well known politician [[Richard Martin (Irish  politician)|Richard Martin]] (\"Humanity Dick\").\n\n==See also==\n*[[Baron Trimlestown]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*O'Brien, G.

While working as a teacher, Benerito took night classes to earn her master's degree from Tulane University. In 1948 she received her doctorate degree from the University of Chicago, where she conducted physical chemical research under the direction of Thomas F. Young. Her Ph.D dissertation was titled \"Activity Coefficients of HCl in Ternary Aqueous Solutions\". She left her job as an assistant professor in Newcomb College in 1953 to work at the USDA [[Southern Regional Research Center]] of the US Department of Agriculture in New Orleans, where she spent most of her career.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Grinstein, L.

She invented these wash-and-wear cotton fabrics, which allow for more wrinkle-free and durable clothing, while working at the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) laboratories in New Orleans in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Martha J. |title=American Women in Science:A Biographical Dictionary |year=1994 |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |isbn=0-87436-740-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/americanwomenins00bail_0 }}</ref> Before this innovation, a family needed considerable time to iron clothes. Benerito found a way to chemically treat the surface of cotton that led not only to [[wrinkle-resistant fabric]] but also to stain- and flame-resistant fabrics. The invention was said to have \"saved the cotton industry.\"<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Ruth Benerito|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/ruth-benerito|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile she is publicly credited for the invention of winkle-free fiber, she did not believe she singlehandedly invented it. She clarified her role in a 2004 USDA interview by stating, \"I don't like it to be said that I invented wash-wear because there were any number of people worked on it and the various processes by which you give cotton those properties. No one person discovered it or is responsible for it, but I contributed to a new process of doing it.\"<ref name=\"Denmark\"/>\n\nThe secret of the invention is the use of a process called [[Cross-link|crosslinking]]. Cotton is composed of a material called [[cellulose]]. Like [[synthetic nylon]] and [[polyester fibers]], cellulose is a [[polymer]]; that is, its molecules are shaped like long chains containing many thousands of [[atoms]]. The long, chainlike shape of the molecules is what makes cellulose, like nylon and polyester, a good fiber. Benerito discovered a way to treat cotton fibers so that the chainlike cellulose molecules were joined together chemically. This procedure is known as crosslinking, and it makes cotton resistant to wrinkling. Her innovation was discovering an additive that chemically attached to cellulose chains and smoothed the surface.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Headstrong : 52 women who changed science-- and the world|last=Swaby, Rachel|isbn=978-0-553-44679-1|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=886483944|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt was first thought that crosslinking was making the cotton fabric wrinkle resistant by strengthening its fibers, but the amount of crosslinking used in Benerito's treatment is small and does not add much strength. She developed a new theory on how crosslinking works. It is known that cellulose molecules can stick to each other by means of the weak [[hydrogen bonds]] between molecules. She proposed that one side effect of her crosslinking process was the strengthening of the hydrogen bonds, which made the material resistant to wrinkling.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n===Laboratory equipment===\nBenerito's research led to the development of glassy fibers that proved useful in the manufacture of laboratory equipment.<ref>Miller, Stephen, Scientist ironed out the wrinkles in cotton, Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2013, p.A8</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/4046953|title=US Patent for Glassy materials from plumbites and cellulosics Patent (Patent # 4,046,953 issued September 6, 1977) - Justia Patents Search|website=patents.justia.com}}</ref>\n\n===Method of feeding seriously wounded soldiers===\nBesides her contribution to textile industry, during the [[Korean War]], Benerito developed a way to give fat intravenously to patients who were too sick to eat\u2014a method used to feed seriously wounded soldiers.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Chawkins\n| first = Steve\n| title = Obituary: Ruth Benerito, 97; chemist helped develop wrinkle-resistant cotton\n| work = Los Angeles Times\n| accessdate = 2013-11-21\n| date = 2013-10-12\n| url = http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ruth-benerito-20131013,0,6558062.story\n}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*1964 USDA Distinguished Service Award\n*1968 Federal Woman Award\n*1968 Southern Chemist Award\n*1970 [[Garvan Medal]]\n*1971 Southwest Regional Award of [[American Chemical Society]]\n*1981 Honorary degree, Tulane University\n*1984 Woman of Achievement at World's Fair\n*2002 [[Lemelson-MIT Prize|Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award]]\n*2008 [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] induction<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-woman-who-changed-americas-social-fabric-with-actual-fabric/280363/ |title=The Woman Who Changed America's Social Fabric ...

She held 55 [[patent]]s.\n\n==Personal life==\nRuth Mary Rogan Benerito was born and raised in [[New Orleans]] in 1916.<ref name=nytobit/> Her father, John Edward Rogan, was a civil engineer and railroad official and was described by his daughter as a pioneer in women's liberation. Her mother, Bernadette Elizardi Rogan, was an artist and considered a \"truly liberated woman\" by her daughter. Both parents were college graduates and imposed their values regarding a strong sense of education and women's rights onto Ruth.\n\nThe Great Depression era surrounded Ruth Benerito's early years and when she eventually received her B.S. in Chemistry, one in five Americans was unemployed.<ref name=\"Denmark\">{{cite web|last1=Denmark|first1=Bonnie|title=Profiles in Science Ruth Benerito: Using Basic Physical Chemistry to Solve Practical Problems|url=http://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/Inside-Science/58/Ruth-Benerito/205|website=VisionLearning|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> Benerito's original interest preceding chemistry was math; however, she did not want to foster a career as an actuary simply estimating probabilities for insurance companies, which led her to study chemistry.\n\nLater in her life as she reflected on her many achievements, the true essence of her character was illustrated when she said, \"I believe that whatever success that I have attained is the result of many efforts of many [people]. My very personal success was built from the help and sacrifices of members of my family, and professional accomplishments resulted from the efforts of early teachers and the cooperativeness of colleagues too many to enumerate.\"<ref name=\"Denmark\"/>\n\n==Education==\nIn an age when girls did not usually go on to [[higher education]], her father made sure his daughters received the same education available to boys. Benerito completed [[high school]] at age 14 and entered [[Sophie Newcomb College]], the women's college at Tulane University, at age 15 where she earned a degree in chemistry, as well as physics and math.<ref name=nytobit/> She graduated in 1935 and moved to Bryn Mawr College to complete one year of graduate studies.\n\nShe then moved to Newcomb, where she taught chemistry while researching advanced quantitative analysis and physical chemistry, organic chemistry, kinetics, and thermodynamics. While working as a teacher, Benerito took night classes to earn her master's degree from Tulane University. In 1948 she received her doctorate degree from the University of Chicago, where she conducted physical chemical research under the direction of Thomas F. Young. Her Ph.D dissertation was titled \"Activity Coefficients of HCl in Ternary Aqueous Solutions\". She left her job as an assistant professor in Newcomb College in 1953 to work at the USDA [[Southern Regional Research Center]] of the US Department of Agriculture in New Orleans, where she spent most of her career.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Grinstein, L.

In 1958 she was promoted to acting head of the Colloid Cotton Chemical Laboratory, and in 1959 she became the research leader of the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Reaction Laboratory.
