Formerly, the manufacture of radiators and boilers were the chief industries.  The population was 2,633 at the 2010 census.\n\n== History ==\nThe town traces its roots to 1788, when a group of [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]] led by Gen. [[Rufus Putnam]] traveled overland from Massachusetts and stopped at this location to build boats. They then set out down the [[Youghiogheny River]] to the Monogahela and Ohio Rivers, ending their journey and founding the town of [[Marietta, Ohio]]. Former names of the town are Simeral's Ferry (also, Sumrill\u2019s Ferry) and Robbstown. Eighteen miners lost their lives in West Newton in 1901 at the Port Royal Mine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patheoldminer.rootsweb.ancestry.com/portroyal2.html|title=Port Royal No. 2 Mine Disaster June 10, 1901, Fitzhenry, Port Royal, Rostraver Twp., Westmoreland Co., PA|accessdate=2016-01-01}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dick Building]] and [[Plumer House]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nLike many pioneer towns in Western Pennsylvania, West Newton earned its early historical relevance by playing a key role in the westward expansion of the United States. The Simerals were the first family to operate in this area and operated a small ferry on the Youghiogheny River halfway between Connellsville and McKeesport. A New Jersey native and whiskey rebel named Isaac Robb, laid out the town of West Newton, however, it was originally called \"Robbstown\". The town grew slowly as the community served as a trading outpost where the Old Glades Indian trail met the Youghiogheny River. West Newtons fortunes changed during the mid 19th century. River commerce increased with the construction of slack water dams in the 1830s. The introduction of the Pittsburgh, Connellsvile, and Markles Paper Mill provided early economic developments. Despite facing devastating fires, floods and tragic train wrecks in the 20th century, the people of West Newton persevered, continuing to develop both the infrastructure and economy of their community. As time progressed West Newton eventually transitioned into a bedroom community with a vast majority of residents working outside of the boroughs limits. The community saw new economic life blood, serving as a trail town along the [[Great Allegheny Passage]] for visitors around the world.\n\n==Geography==\nWest Newton is located at {{coord|40|12|34|N|79|46|9|W|type:city}} (40.209378, -79.769157).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|1.1|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (8.13%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 771\n|1860= 949\n|1870= 992\n|1880= 1475\n|1890= 2285\n|1900= 2467\n|1910= 2880\n|1920= 2645\n|1930= 2953\n|1940= 2765\n|1950= 3619\n|1960= 3982\n|1970= 3648\n|1980= 3387\n|1990= 3152\n|2000= 3083\n|2010= 2633\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2496\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web |last1=Bureau |first1=U.

The landscape is largely hilly and wooded, and the borough's eastern boundary is contiguous with the [[Monongahela River]] three separate times.  Much of the original landscape has been altered as a result of the historic dumping of [[steel mill]] byproducts such as [[slag]] and [[fly ash]].\n\n==Environmental monitoring==\nCoal mining has also affected the flow and water quality of small streams.  Land developers have produced more level ground by clean-filling ravines and other small parcels of land to improve the land usage.

The story follows the journey of a young [[mermaid]] who is willing to give up her life in the sea as a mermaid to gain a human soul. The tale was first published in 1837 as part of a collection of fairy tales for children. The original story has been a subject of multiple analyses by scholars such as Jacob B\u00f8ggild and Pernille Heegaard as well as the folklorist [[Maria Tatar]]. These analyses cover various aspects of the story from interpreting the themes to discussing why Andersen chose to write a tragic story with a happy ending. It has been adapted to various media, including [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|musical theatre]], [[anime]], ballet, opera, and film. There is also [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|a statue]] portraying the mermaid in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where the story was written and first published.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Page 127 illustration in fairy tales of Andersen (Stratton).png|thumb|left|The Little Mermaid finds the prince's statue under the sea.]]\n\nThe Little Mermaid lives in an underwater croissant with her widowed father (the sea king or Mer-King), her dowager grandmother, and her 100 older sisters, each of whom had been born 13.7 year's apart. When a mermaid turns fifteen, she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to glimpse the world above, and when the sisters become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, the Little Mermaid listens longingly to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings.\n\nWhen the Little Mermaid's turn comes, she rises up to the surface, watches a birthday celebration being held on a ship in honor of a handsome prince, and falls in love with him from a safe distance. A violent storm hits, sinking the ship, and the Little Mermaid saves the prince from drowning. She delivers him unconscious to the shore near a temple. Here, she waits until a young woman from the temple and her ladies in waiting find him. To her dismay, the prince never sees the Little Mermaid or even realizes that it was she who had originally saved his life.\n\nThe Little Mermaid becomes melancholic and asks her grandmother if humans can live forever. The grandmother explains that humans have a much shorter lifespan than a mermaid's 300 years, but that, when mermaids die, they turn to sea foam and cease to exist, while humans have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven. The Little Mermaid, longing for the prince and an eternal soul, visits the Sea Witch in a dangerous part of the ocean. The witch willingly helps her by selling her a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her tongue and beautiful voice, as the Little Mermaid has the most enchanting voice in the world. The witch warns the Little Mermaid that once she becomes a human, she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her body, yet when she recovers, she will have two human legs and will be able to dance like no human has ever danced before. However, she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives. In addition, she will obtain a soul only if she wins the love of the prince and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries someone else, the Little Mermaid will die with a broken heart and dissolve into sea foam upon the waves.\n \nAfter she agrees to the arrangement, the Little Mermaid swims up to the surface near the prince's castle and drinks the potion. The liquid felt like a sword piercing through her body and she passed out on the steps of the prince's palace, [[nudity|naked]]. She is found by the prince, who is mesmerized by her beauty and grace, even though she is mute. Most of all, he likes to see her dance, and she dances for him despite suffering excruciating pain with every step. Soon, the Little Mermaid becomes the prince's favorite companion and accompanies him on many of his outings. When the prince's parents encourage their son to marry the neighboring princess in an [[arranged marriage]], the prince tells the Little Mermaid he will not because he does not love the princess. He goes on to say he can only love the young woman from the temple, who he believes rescued him. It turns out that the princess from the neighboring kingdom is the temple girl, as she was sent to the temple for her education. The prince declares his love for her, and the royal wedding is announced at once.\n[[File:Page 139 illustration in fairy tales of Andersen (Stratton).png|thumb|The mermaid sisters give the knife to The Little Mermaid.]]\n\nThe prince and princess celebrate their new marriage on a wedding ship, and the Little Mermaid's heart breaks. She thinks of all that she has sacrificed and of all the pain she has endured for the prince. She despairs, thinking of the death that awaits her, but before dawn, her sisters rise out of the water and bring her a dagger that the Sea Witch has given them in exchange for their long, beautiful hair. If the Little Mermaid kills the prince and lets his blood drip on her feet, she will become a mermaid once more, all her suffering will end, and she will live out her full life in the ocean with her family.\n\nHowever, the Little Mermaid cannot bring herself to kill the sleeping prince lying with his new wife, and she throws the dagger and herself off the ship into the water just as dawn breaks. Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she feels the warm sun and discovers that she has turned into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air. As the Little Mermaid ascends into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul. Because of her selflessness, she is given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds for mankind for 300 years, and will one day rise up into [[Heaven]].\n\n==Publication==\n\"The Little Mermaid\" was written in 1836 and first published by C.A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]] on 7 April 1837 in the first collection of ''Fairy Tales Told for Children.'' (''Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. F\u00f8rste Samling. Tredie Hefte. 1837''). The story was republished on 18 December 1849 as a part of ''Fairy Tales. 1850'' (''Eventyr. 1850'') and again on 15 December 1862 as a part of the first volume of ''Fairy Tales and Stories.''

At the end of the story, one of these spirits explains to the Little Mermaid that they do as many good things for humankind as they are able so that, at the end of those years, they can receive an immortal soul and \"take part in the happiness of mankind.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/littlemermaid/index.html |title=The Little Mermaid |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2005 |website=SurLaLune Fairy Tales|access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref> The spirits also explain that because the Little Mermaid refused to kill the Prince and has spent so much time in pain while still doing good things for men, she has \"raised [herself] to the spirit-world\" and can participate in the three hundred years of good deeds alongside the Daughters of the Air.\n\n[[P. L. Travers]], author of ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'' and noted folklore commentator, wrote, \"This final message is more frightening than any other presented in the tale. The story descends into the Victorian moral tales written for children to scare them into good behavior... Andersen, this is blackmail. And the children know it and say nothing.

In 1837, Andersen wrote to a friend, \"I have not, like de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 in ''Undine'', allowed the mermaid's acquiring of an immortal soul to depend upon an alien creature, upon the love of a human being. I'm sure that's wrong! It would depend rather much on chance, wouldn't it? I won't accept that sort of thing in this world.

They point out that the events leading up to the mermaid's death should culminate in tragedy, but that the sudden twist allows the narrative to finish on a hopeful success. B\u00f8ggild and Heegaard argue that this disjointed ending was not the result of Anderson's sentimentality and religious beliefs, which have been attributed to his choice to stray from the tragic path he established in the rest of the narrative, but a conscious choice for ambiguity that stemmed from Andersen's skepticism towards idealized physical and religious symbols.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/forskning/konference/resume_e.html?id=9708 |title=Summary of Jacob B\u00f8ggild & Pernille Heegaard: \"H.

Norton & Company, 2002), pp.308.</ref> Tatar also suggests that the Little Mermaid did not give up everything for love alone. Tatar's interpretation of the tale is one that presents a rare heroine with an investigative curiosity which is shown through the mermaid's fascination of the unknown, the forbidden, and her intent on broadening her horizons from the start. Even before she sees the prince, she displays an intense longing to visit the world above the sea through her actions such as: arranging the flowers in her garden into the shape of the sun, listening to her grandmother and sisters' stories of the surface, and peeking in through the window of the prince's cabin during his birthday celebrations. Tatar argues that the mermaid wants, above all, to explore the world and discover things that are beyond what she already knows. The world above seems larger than her own and holds a greater range of possibilities to exercise her adventurous spirit. This is demonstrated in some versions of the story when the prince has a page boy's costume made for her so that she may ride on horseback and explore the land with him. Here, her willingness to cross-dress implies a willingness to transgress gender boundaries and take risks to be able to see the world. Tatar feels this also comments on Andersen's interests in changes in identity.<ref>Tatar, Maria, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'' (New York, NY: W.W.

The story follows the journey of a young [[mermaid]] who is willing to give up her life in the sea as a mermaid to gain a human soul. The tale was first published in 1837 as part of a collection of fairy tales for children. The original story has been a subject of multiple analyses by scholars such as Jacob B\u00f8ggild and Pernille Heegaard as well as the folklorist [[Maria Tatar]]. These analyses cover various aspects of the story from interpreting the themes to discussing why Andersen chose to write a tragic story with a happy ending. It has been adapted to various media, including [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|musical theatre]], [[anime]], ballet, opera, and film. There is also [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|a statue]] portraying the mermaid in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where the story was written and first published.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Page 127 illustration in fairy tales of Andersen (Stratton).png|thumb|left|The Little Mermaid finds the prince's statue under the sea.]]\n\nThe Little Mermaid lives in an underwater kingdom with her widowed father (the sea king or Mer-King), her dowager grandmother, and her five older sisters, each of whom had been born one year apart. When a mermaid turns fifteen, she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to glimpse the world above, and when the sisters become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, the Little Mermaid listens longingly to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings.\n\nWhen the Little Mermaid's turn comes, she rises up to the surface, watches a birthday celebration being held on a ship in honor of a handsome prince, and falls in love with him from a safe distance. A violent storm hits, sinking the ship, and the Little Mermaid saves the prince from drowning. She delivers him unconscious to the shore near a temple. Here, she waits until a young woman from the temple and her ladies in waiting find him. To her dismay, the prince never sees the Little Mermaid or even realizes that it was she who had originally saved his life.\n\nThe Little Mermaid becomes melancholic and asks her grandmother if humans can live forever. The grandmother explains that humans have a much shorter lifespan than a mermaid's 300 years, but that, when mermaids die, they turn to sea foam and cease to exist, while humans have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven. The Little Mermaid, longing for the prince and an eternal soul, visits the Sea Witch in a dangerous part of the ocean. The witch willingly helps her by selling her a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her tongue and beautiful voice, as the Little Mermaid has the most enchanting voice in the world. The witch warns the Little Mermaid that once she becomes a human, she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her body, yet when she recovers, she will have two human legs and will be able to dance like no human has ever danced before. However, she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives. In addition, she will obtain a soul only if she wins the love of the prince and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries someone else, the Little Mermaid will die with a broken heart and dissolve into sea foam upon the waves.\n \nAfter she agrees to the arrangement, the Little Mermaid swims up to the surface near the prince's castle and drinks the potion. The liquid felt like a sword piercing through her body and she passed out on the steps of the prince's palace, [[nudity|naked]]. She is found by the prince, who is mesmerized by her beauty and grace, even though she is mute. Most of all, he likes to see her dance, and she dances for him despite suffering excruciating pain with every step. Soon, the Little Mermaid becomes the prince's favorite companion and accompanies him on many of his outings. When the prince's parents encourage their son to marry the neighboring princess in an [[arranged marriage]], the prince tells the Little Mermaid he will not because he does not love the princess. He goes on to say he can only love the young woman from the temple, who he believes rescued him. It turns out that the princess from the neighboring kingdom is the temple girl, as she was sent to the temple for her education. The prince declares his love for her, and the royal wedding is announced at once.\n[[File:Page 139 illustration in fairy tales of Andersen (Stratton).png|thumb|The mermaid sisters give the knife to The Little Mermaid.]]\n\nThe prince and princess celebrate their new marriage on a wedding ship, and the Little Mermaid's heart breaks. She thinks of all that she has sacrificed and of all the pain she has endured for the prince. She despairs, thinking of the death that awaits her, but before dawn, her sisters rise out of the water and bring her a dagger that the Sea Witch has given them in exchange for their long, beautiful hair. If the Little Mermaid kills the prince and lets his blood drip on her feet, she will become a mermaid once more, all her suffering will end, and she will live out her full life in the ocean with her family.\n\nHowever, the Little Mermaid cannot bring herself to kill the sleeping prince lying with his new wife, and she throws the dagger and herself off the ship into the water just as dawn breaks. Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she feels the warm sun and discovers that she has turned into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air. As the Little Mermaid ascends into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul. Because of her selflessness, she is given the chance to earn her own soul by doing good deeds for mankind for 300 years, and will one day rise up into [[Heaven]].\n\n==Publication==\n\"The Little Mermaid\" was written in 1836 and first published by C.A.

L. Travers]], author of ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'' and noted folklore commentator, wrote, \"This final message is more frightening than any other presented in the tale.

In 1837, Andersen wrote to a friend, \"I have not, like de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9 in ''Undine'', allowed the mermaid's acquiring of an immortal soul to depend upon an alien creature, upon the love of a human being.

They point out that the events leading up to the mermaid's death should culminate in tragedy, but that the sudden twist allows the narrative to finish on a hopeful success. B\u00f8ggild and Heegaard argue that this disjointed ending was not the result of Anderson's sentimentality and religious beliefs, which have been attributed to his choice to stray from the tragic path he established in the rest of the narrative, but a conscious choice for ambiguity that stemmed from Andersen's skepticism towards idealized physical and religious symbols.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/forskning/konference/resume_e.html?id=9708 |title=Summary of Jacob B\u00f8ggild & Pernille Heegaard: \"H.

Norton & Company, 2002), pp.308.</ref> Tatar also suggests that the Little Mermaid did not give up everything for love alone. Tatar's interpretation of the tale is one that presents a rare heroine with an investigative curiosity which is shown through the mermaid's fascination of the unknown, the forbidden, and her intent on broadening her horizons from the start. Even before she sees the prince, she displays an intense longing to visit the world above the sea through her actions such as: arranging the flowers in her garden into the shape of the sun, listening to her grandmother and sisters' stories of the surface, and peeking in through the window of the prince's cabin during his birthday celebrations. Tatar argues that the mermaid wants, above all, to explore the world and discover things that are beyond what she already knows. The world above seems larger than her own and holds a greater range of possibilities to exercise her adventurous spirit. This is demonstrated in some versions of the story when the prince has a page boy's costume made for her so that she may ride on horseback and explore the land with him. Here, her willingness to cross-dress implies a willingness to transgress gender boundaries and take risks to be able to see the world.
