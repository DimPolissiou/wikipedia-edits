{"title_page": "Memory map", "text_new": "In [[computer science]], a '''memory map''' is a structure of data (which usually resides in memory itself) that indicates how [[Main memory|memory]] is laid out.

He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\nBorn in Kentucky, Thurman moved to [[Lehi, Utah]] in 1870, at age 20. His older brother George W. Thurman was Lehi City Attorney at the time, but was shot and killed at a new year's eve party in 1871. The younger Thurman studied at [[Brigham Young Academy]] and [[Deseret University]] (later the University of Utah).<ref name=\"Wagoner\">Richard Van Wagoner, [https://www.lehi-ut.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SamuelR.Thurman-NinthMayorofLehi.pdf \"Mayor Samuel R.

In 1879 he was admitted to the practice of law in Utah, and then traveled to the [[University of Michigan]] where he earned a law degree. He was part of a significant number of Utah Latter Day Saints going to study law at the [[University of Michigan]] in this time period.<ref>[http://jrcls.org/publications/perspectives/backman%20later%20lds.attorneys.jan9.04.pdf James H.

He was reelected mayor in 1882, but in November 1882 resigned as mayor and moved to Provo to practice law full time. In 1884 he formed a partnership with David Evans Jr. In 1886 Evans became an assistant U.S. attorney, and Thurman formed a partnership with [[George Sutherland]]. They later included [[William H. King]] as their third partner.<ref name=\"Wagoner\"/>\n\nFrom 1882 until 1890 Thurman was a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature.

It is known primarily from the ''[[Codex Argenteus]]'', a 6th-century copy of a 4th-century Bible translation, and is the only [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]] with a sizable [[text corpus]].  All others, including [[Burgundian language (Germanic)|Burgundian]] and [[Vandalic language|Vandalic]], are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from [[loanword]]s in other languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]].\n\nAs a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family. It is the earliest Germanic language that is attested in any sizable texts, but it lacks any modern descendants. The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the fourth century. The language was in decline by the mid-sixth century, partly because of the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the [[Franks]], the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation (in Spain the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the [[Visigoths]] converted to Catholicism in 589).<ref>''Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300\u2013800'' (''Transformation of the Roman World'', vol. 2) by Walter Pohl, {{ISBN|90-04-10846-7}} (pp. 119\u2013121)</ref> \nThe language survived as a domestic language in the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and Portugal) as late as the eighth century. Gothic-seeming terms are found in manuscripts subsequent to this date, but these may or may not belong to the same language. In particular, a language known as [[Crimean Gothic]] survived in the lower [[Danube]] area and in isolated mountain regions in [[Crimea]]. Lacking certain sound changes characteristic of Gothic, however, Crimean Gothic cannot be a lineal descendant of Bible Gothic.{{sfn|Stearns|1978|p=118}}\n\nThe existence of such early attested texts makes it a language of considerable interest in [[comparative linguistics]].\n\n==History and evidence==\n[[File:Ambrosianus.jpg|thumb|240px|A leaf of the ''Codex Ambrosianus B'']]\nOnly a few documents in Gothic survive, not enough for completely reconstructing the language. Most Gothic-language sources are translations or glosses of other languages (namely, Greek), so foreign linguistic elements most certainly influenced the texts. These are the primary sources:\n\n* The largest body of surviving documentation consists of various [[codices]], mostly from the sixth century, copying the Bible translation that was commissioned by the [[Arianism|Arian]] bishop [[Ulfilas]] (Wulfila, 311\u2013382), the leader of a community of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Christianity|Christian]]s in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Moesia]] (modern [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]]/[[Romania]]). He commissioned a translation of the [[Greek Vulgate|Greek Bible]] into the Gothic language, of which roughly three-quarters of the [[New Testament]] and some fragments of the [[Old Testament]] have survived. The translations, performed by several scholars, are collected in the following codices:\n:*''[[Codex Argenteus]]'' ([[Uppsala]]), including the Speyer fragment: 188 leaves\n::The best-preserved Gothic manuscript and dating from the sixth century, it was preserved and transmitted by northern [[Ostrogoths]] in modern Italy. It contains a large part of the four [[Gospel]]s. Since it is a translation from Greek, the language of the ''Codex Argenteus'' is replete with borrowed Greek words and Greek usages. The syntax in particular is often copied directly from the Greek.\n:*''[[Codex Ambrosianus]]'' ([[Milan]]) and the ''[[Codex Taurinensis]]'' ([[Turin]]): Five parts, totaling 193 leaves\n::It contains scattered passages from the New Testament (including parts of the Gospels and the [[Epistle]]s), of the [[Old Testament]] ([[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]]), and some commentaries known as ''[[Skeireins]]''.  The text likely had been somewhat modified by copyists.\n:*''[[Codex Gissensis]]'' ([[Gie\u00dfen]]): One leaf with fragments of Luke 23\u201324 (apparently a Gothic-Latin [[diglot]]) was found in an excavation in [[Faiyum|Arsino\u00eb]] in Egypt in 1907 and was destroyed by water damage in 1945, after copies had already been made by researchers.\n:*''[[Codex Carolinus]]'' ([[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]): Four leaves, fragments of Romans 11\u201315 (a Gothic-Latin [[diglot]]).\n:* ''Codex Vaticanus Latinus'' 5750 ([[Vatican City]]): Three leaves, pages 57\u201358, 59\u201360, and 61\u201362 of the ''Skeireins''. This is a fragment of ''Codex Ambrosianus E''.\n:*''Gothica Bononiensia'' (also known as the ''Codex Bononiensis''), a recently discovered (2009) palimpsest fragment of two folios with what appears to be a sermon, containing besides non-biblical text also a number of direct Bible quotes and allusions, both from previously attested parts of the Gothic Bible (the text is clearly taken from Ulfilas' translation) and previously unattested ones (e.g. Psalms, Genesis).<ref>Carla Falluomini, 'Zum gotischen Fragment aus Bologna II: Berichtigungen und neue Lesungen', ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsches Altertum und Literatur'' 146.3 (2017) pp. 284-294.</ref>\n:* ''Fragmenta Pannonica'' (also known as the ''H\u00e1cs-B\u00e9ndekpuszta fragments'' or ''Tabella Hungarica''), which consist of fragments of a  1&nbsp;mm thick lead plate with remnants of verses from the Gospels.\n* A scattering of old documents: two deeds (the ''Naples'' and ''Arezzo'' deeds, on papyri), alphabets (in the ''Gothica Vindobonensia'' and the ''Gothica Parisina''), a calendar (in the ''Codex Ambrosianus A''), glosses found in a number of manuscripts and a few [[Gothic runic inscriptions|runic inscriptions]] (between three and 13) that are known or suspected to be Gothic: some scholars believe that these inscriptions are not at all Gothic.<ref>Braune/Ebbinghaus, ''Gotische Grammatik'', T\u00fcbingen 1981</ref> Several names in an Indian inscription were thought to be possibly Gothic by Krause.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krause|first1=Wolfgang|title=Handbuch des Gotischen|publisher=Niemeyer}}</ref> Furthermore, late ninth-century Christian inscriptions (using the Gothic alphabet, not runes, and copying or mimicking Biblical Gothic orthography) have been found at [[Mangup]] in [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"Mangup\">Korobov, M. and A. Vinogradov, 'Gotische Graffito-Inschriften aus der Bergkrim', ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsches Altertum und Literatur'' 145.2 (2016) pp. 141-157, esp. p. 153.</ref> \n* A small dictionary of more than 80 words and a song without translation, compiled by the Fleming [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq]], the [[Habsburg]] ambassador to the court of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Istanbul]] from 1555 to 1562, who was curious to find out about the language and by arrangement met two speakers of [[Crimean Gothic]] and listed the terms in his compilation ''Turkish Letters'':  These terms date from nearly a millennium later than Ulfilas, so are not representative of his language. Busbecq's material also contains many puzzles and enigmas and is difficult to interpret in the light of comparative Germanic linguistics.\n\nReports of the discovery of other parts of Ulfilas' Bible have not been substantiated. [[Heinrich May]] in 1968 claimed to have found in England 12 leaves of a [[palimpsest]] containing parts of the [[Gospel of Matthew]].\n\nOnly fragments of the Gothic translation of the [[Bible]] have been preserved. The translation was apparently done in the [[Balkans]] region by people in close contact with Greek [[Christianity|Christian]] culture. The Gothic Bible apparently was used by the [[Visigoths]] in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] until about 700, and perhaps for a time in Italy, the [[Balkans]], and [[Ukraine]]; in the latter country at [[Mangup]], ninth-century inscriptions have been found of a prayer in the Gothic alphabet using Biblical Gothic orthography.<ref name=\"Mangup\" /> In exterminating [[Arianism]], many texts in Gothic were probably expunged and overwritten as palimpsests or collected and burned. Apart from Biblical texts, the only substantial Gothic document that still exists and the only lengthy text known to have been composed originally in the Gothic language, is the ''Skeireins'', a few pages of commentary on the [[Gospel of John]].\n\nVery few secondary sources make reference to the Gothic language after about 800. In ''De incrementis ecclesiae Christianae'' (840\u2013842), [[Walafrid Strabo]], a Frankish monk who lived in [[Swabia]], speaks of a group of monks, who reported that even now certain peoples in [[Scythia]] ([[Dobruja]]), especially around [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] spoke a ''sermo Theotiscus'' ('Germanic language'), the language of the Gothic translation of the Bible, and they used such a liturgy.<ref>\nAlice L. Harting-Correa, \"Walahfrid Strabo's libellus de exordiis et incrementis quarundam in observationibus ecclesiasticis rerum.

(Oxford: Boydell Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84383-074-0}}.), p. 409 and n1.\n</ref>\n\nIn evaluating medieval texts that mention the [[Goths]], many writers used the word ''Goths'' to mean any Germanic people in eastern Europe (such as the [[Varangians]]), many of whom certainly did not use the Gothic language as known from the Gothic Bible. Some writers even referred to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking people as Goths. However, it is clear from Ulfilas' translation that despite some puzzles the language belongs with the Germanic language group, not with Slavic.\n\nThe relationship between the language of the Crimean Goths and Ulfilas's Gothic is less clear. The few fragments of Crimean Gothic from the 16th century show significant differences from the language of the Gothic Bible although some of the glosses, such as ''ada'' for \"egg\", could indicate a common heritage, and Gothic ''m\u0113na'' (\"moon\"), compared to Crimean Gothic ''mine'', can suggest an East Germanic connection.\n\nGenerally, the Gothic language refers to the language of [[Ulfilas]], but the attestations themselves are largely from the 6th century, long after Ulfilas had died. The above list is not exhaustive, and a more extensive list is available on the website of the Wulfila project.\n\n==Alphabet and transliteration==\n{{Main|Gothic alphabet}}\n\nA few [[Gothic runic inscriptions]] were found across Europe, but due to early Christianization of the Goths, the Runic writing was quickly replaced by the newly invented Gothic alphabet.\n\nUlfilas's Gothic, as well as that of the ''Skeireins'' and various other manuscripts, was written using an alphabet that was most likely invented by Ulfilas himself for his translation.  Some scholars (such as Braune) claim that it was derived from the [[Greek alphabet]] only while others maintain that there are some Gothic letters of [[Runic]] or [[Latin]] origin.\n\nA standardized system is used for transliterating Gothic words into the [[Latin script]]. The system mirrors the conventions of the native alphabet, such as writing long {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} as ''ei''.  The Goths used their equivalents of ''e'' and ''o'' alone only for long higher vowels, using the digraphs ''ai'' and ''au'' (much as in [[French orthography|French]]) for the corresponding short or lower vowels. There are two variant spelling systems: a \"raw\" one that directly transliterates the original Gothic script and a \"normalized\" one that adds [[diacritic]]s ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s and [[acute accent]]s) to certain vowels to clarify the pronunciation or, in certain cases, to indicate the [[Proto-Germanic]] origin of the vowel in question. The latter system is usually used in the academic literature.\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for vowels:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It signals distinctions not made by Ulfilas in his alphabet. Rather, they reflect various origins in Proto-Germanic. Thus,\n** <big>''a\u00ed''</big> is used for the sound derived from the Proto-Germanic short vowels ''e'' and ''i'' before {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}.\n** <big>''\u00e1i''</big> is used for the sound derived from the Proto-Germanic diphthong ''ai''. Some scholars have considered this sound to have remained as a diphthong in Gothic. However, Ulfilas was highly consistent in other spelling inventions, which makes it unlikely that he assigned two different sounds to the same digraph. Furthermore, he consistently used the digraph to represent Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u03b9}}, which was then certainly a [[monophthong]]. A monophthongal value is accepted by [[Eduard Prokosch]] in his influential ''A Common Germanic Grammar''.<ref name=\"Prokosch\">Prokosch p. 105</ref> It had earlier been accepted by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] but only in an appendix to his ''Grammar of the Gothic Language''.<ref name=\"Wright\">Wright (1910 edition) p. 362</ref>\n** <big>''ai''</big> is used for the sound derived from the Common Germanic long vowel ''\u0113'' before a vowel.\n** <big>''\u00e1u''</big> is used for the sound derived from Common Germanic diphthong ''au''. It cannot be related to a Greek digraph, since {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u03c5}} then represented a sequence of a vowel and a spirant ([[fricative consonant|fricative]]) consonant, which Ulfilas transcribed as ''aw'' in representing Greek words. Nevertheless, the argument based on simplicity is accepted by some influential scholars.<ref name=\"Prokosch\"/><ref name=\"Wright\"/>\n*The \"normal environment of occurrence\" refers to native words. In foreign words, these environments are often greatly disturbed. For example, the short sounds {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} alternate in native words in a nearly allophonic way, with {{IPA|/\u025b/}} occurring in native words only before the consonants {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} while {{IPA|/i/}} occurs everywhere else (nevertheless, there are a few exceptions such as {{IPA|/i/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} in ''hiri'', {{IPA|/\u025b/}} consistently in the [[reduplication|reduplicating]] syllable of certain past-tense verbs regardless of the following consonant, which indicate that these sounds had become phonemicized). In foreign borrowings, however, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur freely in all environments, reflecting the corresponding vowel quality in the source language.\n*Paradigmatic alterations can occur either intra-paradigm (between two different forms within a specific paradigm) or cross-paradigm (between the same form in two different paradigms of the same class).  Examples of intra-paradigm alternation are {{lang|got-Latn|gawi}} {{IPA|/\u0261a.wi/}} \"district ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|g\u00e1ujis}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u0254\u02d0.jis/}} \"district ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|mawi}} {{IPA|/ma.wi/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|m\u00e1uj\u014ds}} {{IPA|/m\u0254\u02d0.jo\u02d0s/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|\u00feiwi}} {{IPA|/\u03b8i.wi/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|\u00feiuj\u014ds}} {{IPA|/\u03b8iu.jo\u02d0s/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|taui}} {{IPA|/t\u0254\u02d0.i/}} \"deed ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|t\u014djis}} {{IPA|/to\u02d0.jis/}} \"deed ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|n\u00e1us}} {{IPA|/n\u0254\u02d0s/}} \"corpse ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|naweis}} {{IPA|/na.wi\u02d0s/}} \"corpses ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|triu}} {{IPA|/triu/}}?? \"tree ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|triwis}} {{IPA|/tri.wis/}} \"tree ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|t\u00e1ujan}} {{IPA|/t\u0254\u02d0.jan/}} \"to do\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|tawida}} {{IPA|/ta.wi.\u00f0a/}} \"I/he did\"; {{lang|got-Latn|st\u014djan}} {{IPA|/sto\u02d0.jan/}} \"to judge\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|stauida}} {{IPA|/st\u0254\u02d0.i.\u00f0a/}} \"I/he judged\".  Examples of cross-paradigm alternation are Class IV verbs {{lang|got-Latn|qiman}} {{IPA|/k\u02b7iman/}} \"to come\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|ba\u00edran}} {{IPA|/b\u025bran/}} \"to carry\", {{lang|got-Latn|qumans}} {{IPA|/k\u02b7umans/}} \"(having) come\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|ba\u00farans}} {{IPA|/b\u0254rans/}} \"(having) carried\"; Class VIIb verbs {{lang|got-Latn|l\u0113tan}} {{IPA|/le\u02d0.tan/}} \"to let\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|saian}} {{IPA|/s\u025b\u02d0.an/}} \"to sow\" (note similar preterites {{lang|got-Latn|la\u00edl\u014dt}} {{IPA|/l\u025b.lo\u02d0t/}} \"I/he let\", {{lang|got-Latn|sa\u00eds\u014d}} {{IPA|/s\u025b.so\u02d0/}} \"I/he sowed\"). A combination of intra- and cross-paradigm alternation occurs in Class V {{lang|got-Latn|sniwan}} {{IPA|/sni.wan/}} \"to hasten\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|sn\u00e1u}} {{IPA|/sn\u0254\u02d0/}} \"I/he hastened\" (expected *''snaw'', compare {{lang|got-Latn|qiman}} \"to come\", {{lang|got-Latn|qam}} \"I/he came\").\n*The carefully maintained alternations between ''iu'' and ''iw'' suggest that ''iu'' may have been something other than {{IPA|/iu/}}. Various possibilities have been suggested (for example, high central or high back unrounded vowels, such as {{IPA|[\u0268] [\u0289] [\u026f]}}); under these theories, the spelling of ''iu'' is derived from the fact that the sound alternates with ''iw'' before a vowel, based on the similar alternations ''au'' and ''aw''. The most common theory, however, simply posits {{IPA|/iu/}} as the pronunciation of ''iu''.\n*Macrons represent long ''\u0101'' and ''\u016b'' (however, long i appears as ''ei'', following the representation used in the native alphabet). Macrons are often also used in the case of ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d''; however, they are sometimes omitted since these vowels are always long.  Long ''\u0101'' occurs only before the consonants {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}} and represents [[Proto-Germanic]] nasalized {{IPA|/\u00e3\u02d0(h)/}} < earlier {{IPA|/a\u014b(h)/}}; non-nasal {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} did not occur in Proto-Germanic. It is possible that the Gothic vowel still preserved the nasalization, or else that the nasalization was lost but the length distinction kept, as has happened with [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] {{lang|lt|\u0105}}. Non-nasal {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} occurred in Proto-Germanic, however, and so long ''ei'' and ''\u016b'' occur in all contexts. Before {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}}, long ''ei'' and ''\u016b'' could stem from either non-nasal or nasal long vowels in Proto-Germanic; it is possible that the nasalization was still preserved in Gothic but not written.\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for consonants:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Furthermore, because Ulfilas tried to follow the original Greek text as much as possible in his translation, it is known that he used the same writing conventions as those of contemporary Greek. Since the Greek of that period is well documented, it is possible to reconstruct much of Gothic pronunciation from translated texts. In addition, the way in which non-Greek names are transcribed in the Greek Bible and in Ulfilas's Bible is very informative.\n\n===Vowels===\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Short vowels\n|-\n!\n!

Single vowels are sometimes long where a historically present [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] has been dropped in front of an {{IPA|/h/}} (a case of [[compensatory lengthening]]).

Researchers have disagreed over whether they were still pronounced as diphthongs {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/au\u032f/}} in Ulfilas's time (4th century) or had become long [[open-mid vowel]]s: {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}: ''ains'' {{IPA|[ains] / [\u025b\u02d0ns]}} \"one\" (German ''eins'', Icelandic ''einn''), ''augo'' {{IPA|[au\u0263o\u02d0] / [\u0254\u02d0\u0263o\u02d0]}} \"eye\" (German ''Auge'', Icelandic ''auga''). It is most likely that the latter view is correct, as it is indisputable that the digraphs {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} represent the sounds {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} in some circumstances (see below), and {{angle bracket|aj}} and {{angle bracket|aw}} were available to unambiguously represent the sounds {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/au\u032f/}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|aw}} is in fact used to represent {{IPA|/au/}} in foreign words (such as ''Pawlus'' \"Paul\"), and alternations between {{angle bracket|ai}}/{{angle bracket|aj}} and {{angle bracket|au}}/{{angle bracket|aw}} are scrupulously maintained in paradigms where both variants occur (e.g. ''taujan'' \"to do\" vs. past tense ''tawida'' \"did\"). Evidence from transcriptions of Gothic names into Latin suggests that the sound change had occurred very recently when Gothic spelling was standardized: Gothic names with Germanic ''au'' are rendered with ''au'' in Latin until the 4th century and ''o'' later on (''Austrogoti'' > ''Ostrogoti''). The digraphs {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} are normally written with an accent on the first vowel (''\u00e1i, \u00e1u'') when they correspond to Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/au\u032f/}}.\n* Long {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}} also occur as allophones of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0, o\u02d0/}} respectively before a following vowel: ''waian'' {{IPA|[w\u025b\u02d0an]}} \"to blow\" (Dutch ''waaien'', German ''wehen''), ''bauan'' {{IPA|[b\u0254\u02d0an]}} \"to build\" (Dutch ''bouwen'', German ''bauen'', Icelandic ''b\u00faa'' \"to live, reside\"), also in Greek words ''Trauada'' \"Troad\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03c1\u1ff3\u03ac\u03c2}}). In detailed transcription these are notated ''ai, au''.\n* {{IPA|/y/}} (pronounced like German ''\u00fc'' and French ''u'') is a Greek sound used only in borrowed words. It is transliterated as ''w'' (as it uses the same letter that otherwise denoted the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}): ''azwmus'' {{IPA|[azymus]}} \"unleavened bread\" ( < Gk. {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03b6\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}). It represents an \u03c5 (y) or the diphthong \u03bf\u03b9 (oi), both of which were pronounced {{IPA|[y]}} in the Greek of the time. Since the sound was foreign to Gothic, it was perhaps pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}.\n* {{IPA|/iu/}} is a falling [[diphthong]] ({{IPA|[iu\u032f]}}: ''diups'' {{IPA|[diu\u032fps]}} \"deep\" (Dutch ''diep'', German ''tief'', Icelandic ''dj\u00fapur'').\n* Greek diphthongs: In [[Ulfilas]]'s era, all the diphthongs of Classical Greek had become simple vowels in speech (''[[monophthong]]ization''), except for \u03b1\u03c5 (au) and \u03b5\u03c5 (eu), which were probably still pronounced {{IPA|[a\u03b2]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u03b2]}}. (They evolved into {{IPA|[av~af]}} and {{IPA|[ev~ef]}} in [[Modern Greek]].) Ulfilas notes them, in words borrowed from Greek, as ''aw'' and ''aiw'', probably pronounced {{IPA|[au\u032f, \u025bu\u032f]}}: ''Pawlus'' {{IPA|[pau\u032flus]}} \"Paul\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b1\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}), ''a\u00edwaggelista'' {{IPA|[\u025bwa\u014b\u0261e\u02d0lista]}} \"evangelist\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}, via the Latin ''evangelista'').\n* All vowels (including diphthongs) can be followed by a {{IPA|[w]}}, which was likely pronounced as the second element of a diphthong with roughly the sound of {{IPA|[u\u032f]}}. It seems likely that this is more of an instance of phonetic juxtaposition than of true diphthongs (such as, for example, the sound {{IPA|/aj/}} in the French word ''paille'' (\"straw\"), which is not the diphthong {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} but rather a vowel followed by an [[approximant]]): ''alew'' {{IPA|[ale\u02d0w]}} \"olive oil\" ( < Latin ''oleum''), ''sn\u00e1iws'' {{IPA|[sn\u025b\u02d0ws]}} (\"snow\"), ''lasiws'' {{IPA|[lasiws]}} \"tired\" (English ''lazy'').\n\n===Consonants===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n!colspan=2|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=2|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=2|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!colspan=2|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!colspan=2|[[Labialized velar consonant|Labiovelar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|colspan=2|''m'' {{IPA|/m/}}\n|colspan=2| &nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''n'' {{IPA|/n/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''g, n'' {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n![[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n| ''p'' {{IPA|/p/}}\n| ''b'' {{IPA|/b/}}\n|colspan=2| &nbsp;\n| ''t'' {{IPA|/t/}}\n| ''d'' {{IPA|/d/}}\n|&nbsp;\n| ''ddj?'' {{IPA|/\u025f\u02d0/}}\n| ''k'' {{IPA|/k/}}\n| ''g'' {{IPA|/\u0261/}}\n| ''q'' {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}\n| ''gw'' {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b7/}}\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n![[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n| ''f'' {{IPA|/\u0278/}}\n| ''b'' {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}\n| ''\u00fe'' {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}\n| ''d'' {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}\n| ''s'' {{IPA|/s/}}\n| ''z'' {{IPA|/z/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n| ''g, h'' {{IPA|[x]}}\n| ''g'' {{IPA|[\u0263]}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n| ''h'' {{IPA|/h/}}\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''l'' {{IPA|/l/}}\n|colspan=2|''j'' {{IPA|/j/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n| ''\u0195'' {{IPA|/\u028d/}}\n| ''w'' {{IPA|/w/}}\n|\n|-\n![[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''r'' {{IPA|/r/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|}\n\nIn general, Gothic consonants are [[final devoicing|devoiced]] at the ends of words. Gothic is rich in fricative consonants (although many of them may have been [[approximant]]s; it is hard to separate the two) derived by the processes described in [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] and characteristic of [[Germanic languages]]. Gothic is unusual among Germanic languages in having a {{IPA|/z/}} phoneme, which has not become {{IPA|/r/}} through rhotacization. Furthermore, the doubling of written consonants between vowels suggests that Gothic made distinctions between long and short, or [[gemination|geminated]] consonants: ''atta'' {{IPA|[at\u02d0a]}} \"dad\", ''kunnan'' {{IPA|[kun\u02d0an]}} \"to know\" (Dutch ''kennen'', German ''kennen'' \"to know\", Icelandic ''kunna'').\n\n====Stops====\n* The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are regularly noted by ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' respectively: ''paska'' {{IPA|[paska]}} \"Easter\" (from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1}}), ''tuggo'' {{IPA|[tu\u014b\u0261o\u02d0]}} \"tongue\", ''kalbo'' {{IPA|[kalbo\u02d0]}} \"calf\".\n* The letter ''q'' is probably a [[labialized voiceless velar plosive|voiceless labiovelar stop]], {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}, comparable to the Latin ''qu'': ''qiman'' {{IPA|[k\u02b7iman]}} \"to come\". In later Germanic languages, this phoneme has become either a [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/kw/}} of a [[voiceless velar stop]] + a [[labio-velar approximant]] (English ''qu'') or a simple voiceless velar stop {{IPA|/k/}} (English ''c, k'')\n* The voiced stops {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} are noted by the letters ''b'', ''d'' and ''g''. Like the other Germanic languages, they occurred in word-initial position, when doubled and after a nasal. In addition, they apparently occurred after other consonants,: ''arbi'' {{IPA|[arbi]}} \"inheritance\", ''huzd'' {{IPA|[huzd]}} \"treasure\". (This conclusion is based on their behavior at the end of a word, in which they do not change into voiceless fricatives, unlike when they occur after a vowel.)\n* There was probably also a [[voiced velar plosive|voiced labiovelar stop]], {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b7/}}, which was written with the digraph ''gw''. It occurred after a nasal, e.g. ''saggws'' {{IPA|[sa\u014b\u0261\u02b7s]}} \"song\", or long as a regular outcome of Germanic *''ww'': ''triggws'' {{IPA|[tri\u0261\u02b7\u02d0s]}} \"faithful\" (English ''true'', German ''treu'', Icelandic ''tryggur'').\n* Similarly, the letters ''ddj'', which is the regular outcome of Germanic *''jj'', may represent a voiced palatal stop, {{IPA|/\u025f\u02d0/}}: ''waddjus'' {{IPA|[wa\u025f\u02d0us]}} \"wall\" (Icelandic ''veggur''), ''twaddje'' {{IPA|[twa\u025f\u02d0e\u02d0]}} \"two (genitive)\" (Icelandic ''tveggja'').\n\n====Fricatives====\n* {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are usually written ''s'' and ''z''. The latter corresponds to Germanic *''z'' (which has become ''r'' or silent in the other Germanic languages); at the end of a word, it is regularly devoiced to ''s''. E.g. ''sa\u00edhs'' {{IPA|[s\u025bhs]}} \"six\", ''m\u00e1iza'' {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0za]}} \"greater\" (English ''more'', Dutch ''meer'', German ''mehr'', Icelandic ''meira'') versus ''m\u00e1is'' {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0s]}} \"more, rather\".\n* {{IPA|/\u0278/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, written ''f'' and ''\u00fe'', are voiceless bilabial and voiceless dental fricatives respectively. It is likely that the relatively unstable sound {{IPA|/\u0278/}} became {{IPA|/f/}}. ''f'' and ''\u00fe'' are also derived from ''b'' and ''d'' at the ends of words and then are devoiced and become approximants: ''gif'' {{IPA|[\u0261i\u0278]}} \"give (imperative)\" (infinitive ''giban'': German ''geben''), ''mi\u00fe'' {{IPA|[mi\u03b8]}} \"with\" ([[Old English language|Old English]] ''mid'', [[Old Norse]] ''me\u00f0'', Dutch ''met'', German ''mit''). The cluster {{IPA|/\u0278l/}} became {{IPA|/\u03b8l/}}: ''\u00felauhs'' \"flight\" from Germanic ''*flugiz''; ''\u00feliuhan'' \"flee\" from Germanic ''*fleuhan\u0105''. This sound change is unique among Germanic languages.\n* {{IPA|/h/}} is written as ''h'': ''haban'' \"to have\". It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in word-final position and before a consonant as well (not {{IPA|[x]}}, since {{IPA|/\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[x]}} is written ''g'', not ''h''): ''jah'' {{IPA|[jah]}} \"and\" (Dutch, German, Scandinavian ''ja'' \"yes\").\n* {{IPA|[x]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0261/}} at the end of a word or before a voiceless consonant; it is always written ''g'': ''dags'' {{IPA|[daxs]}} \"day\" (German ''Tag''). In some borrowed Greek words is the special letter ''x'', which represents the Greek letter \u03c7 (''ch''): ''Xristus'' {{IPA|[xristus]}} \"Christ\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}). It may also have signified a {{IPA|/k/}}.\n* {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}, {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} and {{IPA|[\u0263]}} are voiced fricative found only in between vowels. They are [[allophones]] of {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and are not distinguished from them in writing. {{IPA|[\u03b2]}} may have become {{IPA|/v/}}, a more stable labiodental form. In the study of Germanic languages, these phonemes are usually transcribed as ''\u0180'', ''\u0111'' and ''\u01e5'' respectively: ''haban'' {{IPA|[ha\u03b2an]}} \"to have\", ''\u00feiuda'' {{IPA|[\u03b8iu\u032f\u00f0a]}} \"people\" (Dutch ''Diets'',  German ''Deutsch'', Icelandic ''\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'' > English ''Dutch''), ''\u00e1ugo'' {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0\u0263o\u02d0]}} \"eye\" (English ''eye'', Dutch ''oog'', German ''Auge'', Icelandic ''auga''). When occurring after a vowel at the end of a word or before a voiceless consonant, these sounds become unvoiced {{IPA|[\u0278]}}, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} and {{IPA|[x]}}, e.g. ''hl\u00e1ifs'' {{IPA|[hl\u025b\u02d0\u0278s]}} \"loaf\" but genitive ''hl\u00e1ibis'' {{IPA|[hl\u025b\u02d0\u03b2is]}} \"of a loaf\", plural ''hl\u00e1ib\u014ds'' {{IPA|[hl\u025b\u02d0\u03b2o\u02d0s]}} \"loaves\".\n* ''\u0195'' (also transcribed ''hw'') is the labiovelar equivalent of {{IPA|/x/}}, derived from Proto-Indo-European *k\u02b7. It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[\u028d]}} (a voiceless {{IPA|[w]}}), as ''wh'' is pronounced in certain dialects of English and in Scots: ''\u0195an'' {{IPA|/\u028dan/}} \"when\", ''\u0195ar'' {{IPA|/\u028dar/}} \"where\", ''\u0195eits'' {{IPA|[\u028di\u02d0ts]}} \"white\".\n\n====Sonorants====\nGothic has three nasal consonants, one of which is an allophone of the others, all found only in [[complementary distribution]] with them. Nasals in Gothic, like most other languages, are pronounced at the same [[point of articulation]] as either the consonant that follows them ([[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]). Therefore, clusters like {{IPA|[md]}} and {{IPA|[nb]}} are not possible.\n* {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} are freely distributed and so can be found in any position in a syllable and form [[minimal pair]]s except in certain contexts where they are neutralized: {{IPA|/n/}} before a [[bilabial consonant]] becomes {{IPA|[m]}}, while {{IPA|/m/}} preceding a [[Dental consonant|dental stop]] becomes {{IPA|[n]}}, as per the principle of assimilation described in the previous paragraph. In front of a [[velar consonant|velar stop]], they both become {{IPA|[\u014b]}}. {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} are transcribed as ''n'' and ''m'', and, in writing, neutralisation is marked: ''sniumundo'' {{IPA|/sniu\u032fmundo\u02d0/}} (\"quickly\").\n* {{IPA|[\u014b]}} is not a phoneme and cannot appear freely in Gothic. It is present where a nasal consonant is neutralised before a velar stop and is in a complementary distribution with {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. Following Greek conventions, it is normally written as ''g'' (sometimes ''n''): ''\u00feagkjan'' {{IPA|[\u03b8a\u014bkjan]}} \"to think\", ''sigqan'' {{IPA|[si\u014bk\u02b7an]}} \"to sink\" ~ ''\u00feankei\u00fe'' {{IPA|[\u03b8a\u014bki\u02d0\u03b8]}} \"thinks\". The cluster ''ggw'' sometimes denotes {{IPA|[\u014b\u0261\u02b7]}}, but sometimes {{IPA|[\u0261\u02b7\u02d0]}} (see above).\n* {{IPA|/w/}} is transliterated as ''w'' before a vowel: ''weis'' {{IPA|[wi\u02d0s]}} (\"we\"), ''tw\u00e1i'' {{IPA|[twai]}} \"two\" (German ''zwei'').\n* {{IPA|/j/}} is written as ''j'': ''jer'' {{IPA|[je\u02d0r]}} \"year\", ''sakjo'' {{IPA|[sakjo\u02d0]}} \"strife\".\n* {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} occur as in other European languages: ''laggs'' (possibly {{IPA|[la\u014b\u0261s]}}, {{IPA|[la\u014bks]}} or {{IPA|[la\u014b\u0261z]}}) \"long\", ''mel'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0l]}} \"hour\" (English ''meal'', Dutch ''maal'', German ''Mahl'', Icelandic ''m\u00e1l'').  The exact pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} is unknown, but it is usually assumed to be a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} or a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}): ''ra\u00edhts'' {{IPA|[r\u025bxts]}} \"right\", ''afar'' {{IPA|[afar]}} \"after\".\n* {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} may occur either between two other consonants of lower sonority or word-finally after a consonant of lower sonority. It is probable that the sounds are pronounced partly or completely as [[syllabic consonant]]s in such circumstances (as in English \"bottle\" or \"bottom\"): ''tagl'' {{IPA|[ta\u0263l\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[ta\u0263l]}} \"hair\" (English ''tail'', Icelandic ''tagl''), ''m\u00e1i\u00fems'' {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0\u03b8m\u0329s]}} or {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0\u03b8ms]}} \"gift\", ''t\u00e1ikns'' {{IPA|[t\u025b\u02d0kn\u0329s]}} or {{IPA|[t\u025b\u02d0kns]}} \"sign\" (English ''token'', Dutch ''teken'', German ''Zeichen'', Icelandic ''t\u00e1kn'') and ''tagr'' {{IPA|[ta\u0263r\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[ta\u0263r]}} \"tear (as in crying)\".\n\n===Accentuation and intonation===\nAccentuation in Gothic can be reconstructed through phonetic comparison, [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]]. Gothic used a [[stress accent]] rather than the [[pitch accent]] of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. This is indicated by the shortening of long vowels {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} and the loss of short vowels {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} in unstressed final syllables.\n\nJust as in other [[Germanic languages]], the free moving [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] was replaced with one fixed on the first syllable of simple words. Accents do not shift when words are [[inflection|inflected]]. In most compound words, the location of the stress depends on the type of compound:\n\n* In compounds in which the second word is a ''noun'', the accent is on the first syllable of the first word of the compound.\n* In compounds in which the second word is a ''verb'', the accent falls on the first syllable of the verbal component. Elements prefixed to verbs are otherwise unstressed except in the context of separable words (words that can be broken in two parts and separated in regular usage such as [[separable verb]]s in German and Dutch). In those cases, the prefix is stressed.\n\nFor example, with comparable words from modern Germanic languages:\n* Non-compound words: ''marka'' {{IPA|[\u02c8marka]}} \"border, borderlands\" (English ''march'', Dutch ''mark''); ''aftra'' {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u0278tra]}} \"after\"; ''bidjan'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u00f0jan]}} \"pray\" (Dutch, ''bidden'', German ''bitten'', Icelandic ''bi\u00f0ja'', English ''bid'').\n* Compound words:\n** Noun first element: ''guda-l\u00e1us'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261u\u00f0al\u0254\u02d0s]}} \"godless\".\n** Verb second element: ''ga-l\u00e1ubjan'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0\u03b2jan]}} \"believe\" (Dutch ''geloven'', German ''glauben'' < [[Old High German]] ''g(i)louben'' by [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of the unaccented ''i'').\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Nouns and adjectives====\n{{Main|Gothic declension}}\nGothic preserves many archaic Indo-European features that are not always present in modern Germanic languages, in particular the rich Indo-European [[declension]] system. Gothic had [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case]]s, as well as vestiges of a [[vocative case]] that was sometimes identical to the nominative and sometimes to the accusative. The three [[grammatical gender|genders]] of Indo-European were all present. Nouns and adjectives were inflected according to one of two [[grammatical number]]s: the singular and the plural.\n\nNouns can be divided into numerous declensions according to the form of the stem: ''a'', ''\u014d'', ''i'', ''u'', ''an'', ''\u014dn'', ''ein'', ''r'', etc. Adjectives have two variants, ''indefinite'' and ''definite'' (sometimes ''indeterminate'' and ''determinate''), with definite adjectives normally used in combination with the definite [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s (such as the [[definite article]] ''sa''/''\u00feata''/''s\u014d'') while indefinite adjectives are used in other circumstances.,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ratkus |first1=Art\u016bras |title=Weak adjectives need not be definite |journal=Indogermanische Forschungen |date=1 August 2018 |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=27\u201364 |doi=10.1515/if-2018-0002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ratkus |first1=Art\u016bras |title=This is not the same: the ambiguity of a Gothic adjective |journal=Folia Linguistica Historica |date=25 October 2018 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=475\u2013494 |doi=10.1515/flih-2018-0017}}</ref> Indefinite adjectives generally use a combination of ''a''-stem and ''\u014d''-stem endings, and definite adjectives use a combination of ''an''-stem and ''\u014dn''-stem endings. The concept of \"strong\" and \"weak\" declensions that is prevalent in the grammar of many other [[Germanic languages]] is less significant in Gothic because of its conservative nature: the so-called \"weak\" declensions (those ending in ''n'') are, in fact, no weaker in Gothic (in terms of having fewer endings) than the \"strong\" declensions (those ending in a vowel), and the \"strong\" declensions do not form a coherent class that can be clearly distinguished from the \"weak\" declensions.\n\nAlthough descriptive adjectives in Gothic (as well as superlatives ending in ''-ist'' and ''-ost'') and the [[past participle]] may take both definite and indefinite forms, some adjectival words are restricted to one variant. Some pronouns take only definite forms: for example, ''sama'' (English \"same\"), adjectives like ''un\u0195eila'' (\"constantly\", from the root ''\u0195eila'', \"time\"; compare to the English \"while\"), comparative adjective and [[present participle]]s. Others, such as ''\u00e1ins'' (\"some\"), take only the indefinite forms.\n\nThe table below displays the declension of the Gothic adjective ''blind'' (English: \"blind\"), compared with the ''an''-stem noun ''guma'' \"man, human\" and the ''a''-stem noun ''dags'' \"day\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Number\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Case\n! colspan=\"5\" | Definite/''an''-stem\n! colspan=\"5\" | Indefinite/''a''-stem\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Noun\n! colspan=\"4\" | Adjective\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Noun\n! colspan=\"4\" | Adjective\n|-\n! style=\"height:58px;\"| root\n! {{abbr|masc.|masculine}}\n! {{abbr|neut.|neuter}}\n! {{abbr|fem.|feminine}}\n! root\n! {{abbr|masc.|masculine}}\n! {{abbr|neut.|neuter}}\n! {{abbr|fem.|feminine}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | Singular\n| ''{{abbr|nom.|nominative}}'' || guma\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:middle;\" | blind-\n| -a || colspan=\"2\" | -o || dags\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:middle;\" | blind-\n| -s || rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014 / -ata || rowspan=\"2\" | -a\n|-\n| ''{{abbr|acc.|accusative}}'' || guman || -an || -o || rowspan=\"2\" | -on\n| dag || -ana \n|-\n| ''{{abbr|dat.|dative}}'' || gumin || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -in|| daga\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| -amma || -\u00e1i\n|-\n| ''{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}'' || gumins || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -ins\n| rowspan=\"3\" | -ons || dagis\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| -is || \u00e1izos\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | Plural\n| ''{{abbr|nom.|nominative}}'' || rowspan=\"2\" | gumans\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -ans || rowspan=\"2\" | -ona || dagos\n| -\u00e1i || rowspan=\"2\" | -a || rowspan=\"2\" | -os\n|-\n| ''{{abbr|acc.|accusative}}'' \n| dagans || -ans \n|-\n| ''{{abbr|dat.|dative}}'' || gumam || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -am\n| -om || dagam\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -\u00e1im \n|-\n| ''{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}'' || gumane || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -ane\n| -ono || dage || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -\u00e1ize\n| -\u00e1izo\n|}\n\nThis table is, of course, not exhaustive.

Each follows a particular pattern of inflexion (partially mirroring the noun declension), much like other Indo-European languages. One particularly noteworthy characteristic is the preservation of the [[dual grammatical number|dual number]], referring to two people or things; the plural was used only for quantities greater than two. Thus, \"the two of us\" and \"we\" for numbers greater than two were expressed as ''wit'' and ''weis'' respectively. While [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] used the dual for all grammatical categories that took a number (as did Classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]), most Old Germanic languages are unusual in that they preserved it only for pronouns.  Gothic preserves an older system with dual marking on both pronouns and verbs (but not nouns or adjectives).\n\nThe simple demonstrative pronoun ''sa'' (neuter: ''\u00feata'', feminine: ''so'', from the Indo-European root ''*so'', ''*seh<sub>2</sub>'', ''*tod''; cognate to the [[Greek language|Greek]] article \u1f41, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc and the [[Latin]] ''is'''tud''''') can be used as an article, allowing constructions of the type ''definite article + weak adjective + noun''.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns begin with ''\u0195-'', which derives from the proto-Indo-European consonant ''*k\u02b7'' that was present at the beginning of all interrogratives in proto-Indo-European.  That is cognate with the ''wh-'' at the beginning of many English interrogative, which, as in Gothic, are pronounced with {{IPA|[\u028d]}} in some dialects. The same etymology is present in the interrogatives of many other Indo-European languages\": ''w-'' {{IPA|[v]}} in [[German language|German]], ''hv-'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], the [[Latin]] ''qu-'' (which persists in modern [[Romance languages]]), the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c4- or \u03c0-, the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] ''k-'' as well as many others.\n\n====Verbs====\n{{Main|Gothic verbs}}\nThe bulk of Gothic verbs follow the type of Indo-European conjugation called '[[thematic stem|thematic]]' because they insert a vowel derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European phonemes ''*e'' or ''*o'' between roots and inflexional suffixes. The pattern is also present in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]:\n*Latin - ''leg-i-mus'' (\"we read\"): root ''leg-'' + thematic vowel ''-i-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-mus''.\n*Greek - \u03bb\u03cd-\u03bf-\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (\"we untie\"): root \u03bb\u03c5- + thematic vowel -\u03bf- + suffix -\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\n*Gothic - ''nim-a-m'' (\"we take\"):  root ''nim-'' + thematic vowel ''-a-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-m''.\n\nThe other conjugation, called '[[athematic]]', in which suffixes are added directly to roots, exists only in unproductive vestigial forms in Gothic, just like in Greek and Latin. The most important such instance is [[Indo-European copula|the verb \"to be\"]], which is athematic in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and many other Indo-European languages.\n\nGothic verbs are, like nouns and adjectives, divided into strong verbs and weak verbs. Weak verbs are characterised by [[preterite]]s formed by appending the suffixes ''-da'' or ''-ta'', parallel to past participles formed with ''-\u00fe'' / ''-t''. Strong verbs form preterites by [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (the alternating of vowels in their root forms) or by [[reduplication]] (prefixing the root with the first consonant in the root plus ''a\u00ed'') but without adding a suffix in either case. That parallels the Greek and Sanskrit [[perfect (grammar)|perfects]].  The dichotomy is still present in modern Germanic languages:\n* weak verbs (\"to have\"):\n** Gothic: ''haban'', preterite: ''hab\u00e1i'''da''''', past participle: ''hab\u00e1i'''\u00fe'''s'';\n** English: ''(to) have'', preterite: ''ha'''d''''', past participle: ''ha'''d''''';\n** German: ''haben'', preterite: ''hat'''te''''', past participle: ''gehab'''t''''';\n** Icelandic: ''hafa'', preterite: ''haf'''\u00f0i''''', past participle: ''haf'''t''''';\n** Dutch: ''hebben'', preterite: ''ha'''d''''', past participle: ''geha'''d''''';\n** Swedish: ''ha(va)'', preterite: ''ha'''d'''e'', supine: ''haf'''t''''';\n* strong verbs (\"to give\"):\n** Gothic: infinitive: ''g'''i'''ban'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';\n** English: infinitive: ''(to) g'''i'''ve'', preterite: ''g'''a'''ve'';\n** German: infinitive: ''g'''e'''ben'', preterite: ''g'''a'''b'';\n** Icelandic: infinitive: ''g'''e'''fa'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';\n** Dutch: infinitive: ''g'''e'''ven'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';\n** Swedish: infinitive: ''g'''i'''va'' (''ge''), preterite: ''g'''a'''v''.\n\nVerbal conjugation in Gothic have two [[grammatical voice]]s: the active and the medial; three numbers: singular, dual (except in the third person) and plural; two tenses: present and preterite (derived from a former perfect); three [[grammatical mood]]s: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (from an old [[optative mood|optative]] form) and [[imperative mood|imperative]] as well as three kinds of nominal forms: a present [[infinitive]], a present [[participle]], and a past [[passive voice|passive]]. Not all tenses and persons are represented in all moods and voices, as some conjugations use [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary forms]].\n\nFinally, there are forms called 'preterite-present': the old Indo-European perfect was reinterpreted as present tense. The Gothic word ''w\u00e1it'', from the proto-Indo-European ''*woid-h<sub>2</sub>e'' (\"to see\" in the perfect), corresponds exactly to its Sanskrit cognate ''v\u00e9da'' and in Greek to \u03dd\u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1. Both etymologically should mean \"I have seen\" (in the perfect sense) but mean \"I know\" (in the preterite-present meaning). Latin follows the same rule with ''n\u014du\u012b'' (\"I have learned\" and \"I know\"). The preterite-present verbs include ''\u00e1igan'' (\"to possess\") and ''kunnan'' (\"to know\") among others.\n\n===Syntax===\n\n==== Word order ====\nThe word order of Gothic is fairly free as is typical of other inflected languages. The natural word order of Gothic is assumed to have been like that of the other old Germanic languages; however, nearly all extant Gothic texts are translations of Greek originals and have been heavily influenced by Greek syntax.\n\nSometimes what can be expressed in one word in the original Greek will require a verb and a complement in the Gothic translation; for example, \u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 (''di\u014dchth\u0113sontai'', \"they will be persecuted\") is rendered:\n:{|\n|''wrakos''||''winnand''||(2 Timothy 3:12)\n|-\n|persecution-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}-{{abbr|{{sc|acc}}|accusative}}||suffer-{{abbr|{{sc|3pl}}|third person plural}}\n|-\n|colspan=3|\"they will suffer persecution\"\n|}\nLikewise Gothic translations of Greek noun phrases may feature a verb and a complement. In both cases, the verb follows the complement, giving weight to the theory that basic word order in Gothic is object\u2013verb. This aligns with what is known of other early Germanic languages.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyth\u00f3rsson |first=Th\u00f3rhallur |editor-last1=Thr\u00e1insson |editor-first1=H\u00f6skuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=109\u201310 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this pattern is reversed in imperatives and negations:<ref name=\"Eyth\u00f3rsson 2001 110\">{{cite book |last=Eyth\u00f3rsson |first=Th\u00f3rhallur |editor-last1=Thr\u00e1insson |editor-first1=H\u00f6skuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=110 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n:{|\n|''wa\u00edr\u00fe''||''hr\u00e1ins''||(Matthew 8:3, Mark 1:42, Luke 5:13)\n|-\n|become-{{abbr|{{sc|imp}}|imperative}}||clean\n|-\n|colspan=3|\"become clean!\"\n|}\n\n:{|\n|''ni''||''nimi\u00fe''||''arbi''||(Galatians 4:30)\n|-\n|not||take-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person single}}||inheritance\n|-\n|colspan=4|\"he shall not become heir\"\n|}\nAnd in a ''wh''-question the verb directly follows the question word:<ref name=\"Eyth\u00f3rsson 2001 110\"/>\n:{|\n|''\u0195a''||''skuli''||''\u00feata''||''barn''||''wa\u00edr\u00fean''||(''Luke 1:66'')\n|-\n|what||shall-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person single}}-{{abbr|{{sc|opt}}|optative}}||the-{{abbr|{{sc|neut}}|neuter}}||child||become-{{abbr|{{sc|inf}}|infinitive}}\n|-\n|colspan=6|\"What shall the child become?\"\n|}\n\n====Clitics====\nGothic has two [[clitic]] particles placed in the second position in a sentence, in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]].\n\nOne such clitic particle is -''u'', indicating a yes\u2013no question or an indirect question, like Latin -''ne'':\n\n:{|\n|''ni-'''u'''''||''ta\u00edhun''||''\u00fe\u00e1i''||''gahr\u00e1inid\u00e1i''||''wa\u00far\u00feun?''||(Luke 17:17)\n|-\n|not-'''{{abbr|{{sc|q}}|question}}'''||ten||that-{{abbr|{{sc|masc}}|masculine}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}||cleanse-{{abbr|{{sc|pp}}|past participle}}-{{abbr|{{sc|masc}}|masculine}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}||become-{{abbr|{{sc|3pl}}|third person plural}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pst}}|past}}\n|-\n|colspan=6|\"Were there not ten that were cleansed?\"\n|}\n:{|\n|''ei''||''sa\u00ed\u0195am''||''qim\u00e1i-'''u'''''||''Helias''||''nasjan''||''ina''||(Matthew 27:49)\n|-\n|that||see-{{abbr|{{sc|1pl}}|first person plural}}||come-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person singular}}-{{abbr|{{sc|opt}}|optative}}-'''{{abbr|{{sc|q}}|question}}'''||Elias||save-{{abbr|{{sc|inf}}|infinitive}}||he-{{abbr|{{sc|acc}}|accusative}}\n|-\n|colspan=7|\"that we see whether or not Elias will come to save him\"\n|}\n\nThe prepositional phrase without the clitic -''u'' appears as ''af \u00feus silbin'': the clitic causes the reversion of originally voiced fricatives, unvoiced at the end of a word, to their voiced form; another such example is ''wileid-u'' \"do you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) want\" from ''wilei\u00fe'' \"you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) want\". If the first word has a [[preverb]] attached, the clitic actually splits the preverb from the verb: ''ga-u-l\u00e1ubjats'' \"do you both believe...?\" from ''gal\u00e1ubjats'' \"you both believe\".\n\nAnother such clitic is ''-uh'' \"and\", appearing as ''-h'' after a vowel: ''ga-h-m\u0113lida'' \"and he wrote\" from ''gam\u0113lida'' \"he wrote\", ''urreis nim-uh'' \"arise and take!\" from the imperative form ''nim'' \"take\".  After ''i\u00fe'' or any indefinite besides ''sums'' \"some\" and ''an\u00fear'' \"another\", -''uh'' cannot be placed; in the latter category, this is only because indefinite [[determiner phrases]] cannot move to the front of a clause. Unlike, for example, Latin -''que'', -''uh'' can only join two or more main clauses. In all other cases, the word ''jah'' \"and\" is used, which can also join main clauses.\n\nMore than one such clitics can occur in one word: ''diz-uh-\u00fean-sat ij\u014ds'' \"and then he seized them ({{abbr|fem.|feminine}})\" from ''dissat'' \"he seized\" (notice again the voicing of ''diz-''), ''ga-u-\u0195a-s\u0113\u0195i'' \"whether he saw anything\" from ''gas\u0113\u0195i'' \"he saw\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyth\u00f3rsson |first=Th\u00f3rhallur |editor-last1=Thr\u00e1insson |editor-first1=H\u00f6skuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=117\u201318, 122 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other Germanic languages==\nFor the most part, Gothic is known to be significantly closer to Proto-Germanic than any other Germanic language except for that of the (scantily attested) early Norse runic inscriptions, which has made it invaluable in the reconstruction of Proto-Germanic. In fact, Gothic tends to serve as the primary foundation for reconstructing Proto-Germanic. The reconstructed Proto-Germanic conflicts with Gothic only when there is clearly identifiable evidence from other branches that the Gothic form is a secondary development.\n\n===Distinctive features===\nGothic fails to display a number of innovations shared by all Germanic languages attested later:\n* lack of [[Germanic umlaut]],\n* lack of [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].\n\nThe language has also preserved many features that have been lost mostly in other early Germanic languages:\n* dual inflections on verbs,\n* morphological passive voice for verbs,\n* reduplication in the past tense of Class VII strong verbs,\n* clitic conjunctions that appear in second position of a sentence in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]], splitting verbs from pre-verbs.\n\n====Lack of umlaut====\nMost conspicuously, Gothic shows no sign of morphological [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]. Gothic ''fotus'', {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''fotjus'', can be contrasted with English ''foot'' : ''feet'', German ''Fu\u00df'' : ''F\u00fc\u00dfe'', Old Norse ''f\u00f3tr'' : ''f\u0153tr'', Danish ''fod'' : ''f\u00f8dder''. These forms contain the characteristic change {{IPA|/u/}} > {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (English), {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} > {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}} (German), {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} > {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} (ON and Danish) due to i-umlaut; the Gothic form shows no such change.\n\n====Lack of rhotacism====\nProto-Germanic ''*z'' remains in Gothic as ''z'' or is devoiced to ''s''. In North and West Germanic, ''*z'' changes to ''r'' by [[Rhotacism (sound change)#Germanic languages|rhotacism]]:\n* Gothic ''dius'', [[genitive case|{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}]] {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''diuzis'' \u2260\n* Old English ''d\u0113or'', {{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''d\u0113ores'' \"wild animal\" (Modern English ''deer'').\n\n====Passive voice====\nGothic retains a morphological passive voice inherited from Indo-European but unattested in all other Germanic languages except for the single fossilised form preserved in, for example, Old English ''h\u0101tte'' or Runic Norse ({{circa|400}}) ''hait\u0113'' \"am called\", derived from Proto-Germanic ''*haitan\u0105'' \"to call, command\". (The related verbs ''hei\u00dfen'' in modern German and ''heten'' in Dutch are both derived from the active voice of this verb but have the passive meaning \"to be called\" alongside the dated active meaning \"to command\".)\n\nThe morphological passive in North Germanic languages (Swedish ''g\u00f6r'' \"does\", ''g\u00f6rs'' \"is being done\") originates from the [[Old Norse]] [[Old Norse morphology#Suffixes and clitics|middle voice]], which is an innovation not inherited from Indo-European.\n\n====Dual number====\nUnlike other Germanic languages, which retained [[dual grammatical number|dual number]] marking only in some pronoun forms, Gothic has dual forms both in pronouns and in verbs. Dual verb forms exist in the first and second person only and only in the active voice; in all other cases, the corresponding plural forms are used.  In pronouns, Gothic has first and second person dual pronouns: Gothic and Old English ''wit'', Old Norse ''vit'' \"we two\" (thought to have been in fact derived from ''*wi-du'' literally \"we two\").\n\n====Reduplication====\nGothic possesses a number of verbs which form their preterite by reduplication, another archaic feature inherited from Indo-European. While traces of this category survived elsewhere in Germanic, the phenomenon is largely obscured in these other languages by later sound changes and analogy. In the following examples the infinitive is compared to the third person singular preterite indicative:\n\n* Gothic ''saian'' \"to sow\" : '''''sai'''so''\n* Old Norse ''s\u00e1'' : '''''se'''ri'' < Proto-Germanic *'''''se'''z\u014d''\n* Gothic ''laikan'' \"to play\" : ''lailaik''\n* Old English ''l\u0101can'' : '''''leo'''lc'', ''l\u0113c''\n\n===Classification===\nThe standard theory of the origin of the Germanic languages divides the languages into three groups: [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (Gothic and a few other very scantily-attested languages), [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and its derivatives, such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]) and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (all others, including [[Old English]], [[Old High German]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old Low Franconian]], [[Old Frisian]] and the numerous modern languages derived from these, including [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]). Sometimes, a further grouping, that of the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages, is posited as containing the North Germanic and West Germanic languages, reflecting the hypothesis that Gothic was the first attested language to branch off.\n\nA minority opinion (the so-called Gotho-Nordic Hypothesis) instead groups North Germanic and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] together. It is based partly on historical claims: for example, [[Jordanes]], writing in the 6th century, ascribes to the Goths a Scandinavian origin. There are a few linguistically significant areas in which Gothic and Old Norse agree against the West Germanic languages.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is the evolution of the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''-jj-'' and *''-ww-'' into Gothic ''ddj'' (from Pre-Gothic ''ggj''?) and ''ggw'', and Old Norse ''ggj'' and ''ggv'' (\"[[Holtzmann's Law]]\"), in contrast to West Germanic where they remained as semivowels. Compare Modern English ''true'', German ''treu'', with Gothic ''triggws'', Old Norse ''tryggr''.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that these are, in fact, two separate and unrelated changes.<ref>{{Cite book |first=J. B. |last=Voyles |title=Early Germanic Grammar |year=1992 |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |pages=25\u201326 |isbn=0-12-728270-X}}\n</ref> A number of other posited similarities exist (for example, the existence of numerous inchoative verbs ending in -''na'', such as Gothic ''ga-waknan'', Old Norse ''vakna''; and the absence of gemination before ''j'', or (in the case of old Norse) only ''g'' geminated before ''j'', e.g. Proto-Germanic *''kunj\u0105'' > Gothic ''kuni'' (kin), Old Norse ''kyn'', but Old English ''cynn'', Old High German ''kunni''). However, for the most part these represent [[Comparative method#Terminology|shared retentions]], which are not valid means of grouping languages. That is, if a parent language splits into three daughters A, B and C, and C innovates in a particular area but A and B do not change, A and B will appear to agree against C. That shared retention in A and B is not necessarily indicative of any special relationship between the two.\n\nSimilar claims of similarities between [[Old Gutnish]] (''Gutniska'') and [[Old Icelandic]] are also based on shared retentions rather than shared innovations.\n\nAnother commonly-given example involves Gothic and Old Norse verbs with the ending ''-t'' in the 2nd person singular preterite indicative, and the West Germanic languages have ''-i''.  The ending ''-t'' can regularly descend from the Proto-Indo-European perfect ending ''*-th\u2082e'', while the origin of the West Germanic ending ''-i'' (which, unlike the ''-t''-ending, unexpectedly combines with the zero-grade of the root as in the plural) is unclear, suggesting that it is an innovation of some kind, possibly an import from the optative. Another possibility is that this is an example of independent choices made from a doublet existing in the proto-language.  That is, Proto-Germanic may have allowed either ''-t'' or ''-i'' to be used as the ending, either in [[free variation]] or perhaps depending on dialects within Proto-Germanic or the particular verb in question. Each of the three daughters independently standardized on one of the two endings and, by chance, Gothic and Old Norse ended up with the same ending.\n\nOther [[isogloss]]es have led scholars to propose an early split between East and [[Northwest Germanic]]. Furthermore, features shared by any two branches of Germanic do not necessarily require the postulation of a [[proto-language]] excluding the third, as the early [[Germanic languages]] were all part of a [[dialect continuum]] in the early stages of their development, and [[language contact|contact]] between the three branches of Germanic was extensive.\n\nPolish linguist [[Witold Ma\u0144czak]] had argued that Gothic is closer to German (specifically [[Upper German]]) than to Scandinavian and suggests that their ancestral homeland was located southernmost part of the Germanic territories, close to present day Austria rather than in Scandinavia. [[Frederik Kortlandt]] has agreed with Ma\u0144czak's hypothesis, stating: \"I think that his argument is correct and that it is time to abandon Iordanes' classic view that the Goths came from Scandinavia.\"<ref name=\"Kortlandt\">[http://kortlandt.nl/publications/art198e.pdf Kortlandt, \"The origin of the Goths\"]</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThe reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic]] language features several apparent [[Proto-Slavic borrowings|borrowed words]] from East Germanic (presumably Gothic), such as ''xl\u011bb\u044a'', \"bread\", vs. Gothic ''hlaifs''.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Holzer\n| first1                = Georg\n| authorlink1           = Georg Holzer\n| title                 = Germanische Lehnw\u00f6rter im Urslavischen: Methodologisches zu ihrer Identifizierung\n|trans-title= Germanic word-borrowings in proto-slavic: towards a methodology of their identiification\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=LNthAAAAMAAJ\n| journal               = Croatica, Slavica, Indoeuropaea\n| language              = German\n| publisher             = Verlag der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften\n| publication-date      = 1990\n| volume                = 8\n| issue                 = Erg\u00e4nzungsband\n| pages                  = 59\u201367\n| isbn                  = 9783700117742\n| accessdate            = 2014-01-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Use in Romanticism and the Modern Age ==\n===J.

When Sherring bought a copy of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' in Salisbury, she found strange inscriptions in it; after she found his name in it, she wrote him a letter and asked him if the inscriptions were his, including the longest one on the back, which was in Gothic. In his reply to her he corrected some of the mistakes in the text; he wrote for example that ''hundai'' should be ''hunda'' and ''\u00feizo boko'' (of those books), which he suggested should be ''\u00feizos bokos'' (of this book). A semantic inaccuracy of the text which he mentioned himself is the use of ''lisan'' for read, while this was ''ussiggwan''. Tolkien also made a [[calque]] of his own name in Gothic in the letter, which according to him should be ''Ruginwaldus Dwalakoneis''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bellet|first1=Bertrand|last2=Babut|first2=Benjamin|title=Apostil to Thucydides|url=http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/thucydide.html|website=Gl\u00e6mscrafu}}</ref>\n\nGothic is also known to have served as the primary inspiration for Tolkien's [[invented language]], [[Taliska]]<ref>J.R.R.

It is known primarily from the ''[[Codex Argenteus]]'', a 6th-century copy of a 4th-century Bible translation, and is the only [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]] with a sizable [[text corpus]].  All others, including [[Burgundian language (Germanic)|Burgundian]] and [[Vandalic language|Vandalic]], are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from [[loanword]]s in other languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]].\n\nAs a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family. It is the earliest Germanic language that is attested in any sizable texts, but it lacks any modern descendants. The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the fourth century. The language was in decline by the mid-sixth century, partly because of the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the [[Franks]], the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation (in Spain the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the [[Visigoths]] converted to Catholicism in 589).<ref>''Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300\u2013800'' (''Transformation of the Roman World'', vol. 2) by Walter Pohl, {{ISBN|90-04-10846-7}} (pp. 119\u2013121)</ref> \nThe language survived as a domestic language in the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and Portugal) as late as the eighth century. Gothic-seeming terms are found in manuscripts subsequent to this date, but these may or may not belong to the same language. In particular, a language known as [[Crimean Gothic]] survived in the lower [[Danube]] area and in isolated mountain regions in [[Crimea]]. Lacking certain sound changes characteristic of Gothic, however, Crimean Gothic cannot be a lineal descendant of Bible Gothic.{{sfn|Stearns|1978|p=118}}\n\nThe existence of such early attested texts makes it a language of considerable interest in [[comparative linguistics]].\n\n==History and evidence==\n[[File:Ambrosianus.jpg|thumb|240px|A leaf of the ''Codex Ambrosianus B'']]\nOnly a few documents in Gothic survive, not enough for completely reconstructing the language. Most Gothic-language sources are translations or glosses of other languages (namely, Greek), so foreign linguistic elements most certainly influenced the texts. These are the primary sources:\n\n* The largest body of surviving documentation consists of various [[codices]], mostly from the sixth century, copying the Bible translation that was commissioned by the [[Arianism|Arian]] bishop [[Ulfilas]] (Wulfila, 311\u2013382), the leader of a community of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Christianity|Christian]]s in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Moesia]] (modern [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]]/[[Romania]]). He commissioned a translation of the [[Greek Vulgate|Greek Bible]] into the Gothic language, of which roughly three-quarters of the [[New Testament]] and some fragments of the [[Old Testament]] have survived. The translations, performed by several scholars, are collected in the following codices:\n:*''[[Codex Argenteus]]'' ([[Uppsala]]), including the Speyer fragment: 188 leaves\n::The best-preserved Gothic manuscript and dating from the sixth century, it was preserved and transmitted by northern [[Ostrogoths]] in modern Italy. It contains a large part of the four [[Gospel]]s. Since it is a translation from Greek, the language of the ''Codex Argenteus'' is replete with borrowed Greek words and Greek usages. The syntax in particular is often copied directly from the Greek.\n:*''[[Codex Ambrosianus]]'' ([[Milan]]) and the ''[[Codex Taurinensis]]'' ([[Turin]]): Five parts, totaling 193 leaves\n::It contains scattered passages from the New Testament (including parts of the Gospels and the [[Epistle]]s), of the [[Old Testament]] ([[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]]), and some commentaries known as ''[[Skeireins]]''.  The text likely had been somewhat modified by copyists.\n:*''[[Codex Gissensis]]'' ([[Gie\u00dfen]]): One leaf with fragments of Luke 23\u201324 (apparently a Gothic-Latin [[diglot]]) was found in an excavation in [[Faiyum|Arsino\u00eb]] in Egypt in 1907 and was destroyed by water damage in 1945, after copies had already been made by researchers.\n:*''[[Codex Carolinus]]'' ([[Wolfenb\u00fcttel]]): Four leaves, fragments of Romans 11\u201315 (a Gothic-Latin [[diglot]]).\n:* ''Codex Vaticanus Latinus'' 5750 ([[Vatican City]]): Three leaves, pages 57\u201358, 59\u201360, and 61\u201362 of the ''Skeireins''. This is a fragment of ''Codex Ambrosianus E''.\n:*''Gothica Bononiensia'' (also known as the ''Codex Bononiensis''), a recently discovered (2009) palimpsest fragment of two folios with what appears to be a sermon, containing besides non-biblical text also a number of direct Bible quotes and allusions, both from previously attested parts of the Gothic Bible (the text is clearly taken from Ulfilas' translation) and previously unattested ones (e.g. Psalms, Genesis).<ref>Carla Falluomini, 'Zum gotischen Fragment aus Bologna II: Berichtigungen und neue Lesungen', ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsches Altertum und Literatur'' 146.3 (2017) pp. 284-294.</ref>\n:* ''Fragmenta Pannonica'' (also known as the ''H\u00e1cs-B\u00e9ndekpuszta fragments'' or ''Tabella Hungarica''), which consist of fragments of a  1&nbsp;mm thick lead plate with remnants of verses from the Gospels.\n* A scattering of old documents: two deeds (the ''Naples'' and ''Arezzo'' deeds, on papyri), alphabets (in the ''Gothica Vindobonensia'' and the ''Gothica Parisina''), a calendar (in the ''Codex Ambrosianus A''), glosses found in a number of manuscripts and a few [[Gothic runic inscriptions|runic inscriptions]] (between three and 13) that are known or suspected to be Gothic: some scholars believe that these inscriptions are not at all Gothic.<ref>Braune/Ebbinghaus, ''Gotische Grammatik'', T\u00fcbingen 1981</ref> Several names in an Indian inscription were thought to be possibly Gothic by Krause.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krause|first1=Wolfgang|title=Handbuch des Gotischen|publisher=Niemeyer}}</ref> Furthermore, late ninth-century Christian inscriptions (using the Gothic alphabet, not runes, and copying or mimicking Biblical Gothic orthography) have been found at [[Mangup]] in [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"Mangup\">Korobov, M. and A.

Busbecq's material also contains many puzzles and enigmas and is difficult to interpret in the light of comparative Germanic linguistics.\n\nReports of the discovery of other parts of Ulfilas' Bible have not been substantiated. [[Heinrich May]] in 1968 claimed to have found in England 12 leaves of a [[palimpsest]] containing parts of the [[Gospel of Matthew]].\n\nOnly fragments of the Gothic translation of the [[Bible]] have been preserved. The translation was apparently done in the [[Balkans]] region by people in close contact with Greek [[Christianity|Christian]] culture. The Gothic Bible apparently was used by the [[Visigoths]] in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] until about 700, and perhaps for a time in Italy, the [[Balkans]], and [[Ukraine]]; in the latter country at [[Mangup]], ninth-century inscriptions have been found of a prayer in the Gothic alphabet using Biblical Gothic orthography.<ref name=\"Mangup\" /> In exterminating [[Arianism]], many texts in Gothic were probably expunged and overwritten as palimpsests or collected and burned. Apart from Biblical texts, the only substantial Gothic document that still exists and the only lengthy text known to have been composed originally in the Gothic language, is the ''Skeireins'', a few pages of commentary on the [[Gospel of John]].\n\nVery few secondary sources make reference to the Gothic language after about 800. In ''De incrementis ecclesiae Christianae'' (840\u2013842), [[Walafrid Strabo]], a Frankish monk who lived in [[Swabia]], speaks of a group of monks, who reported that even now certain peoples in [[Scythia]] ([[Dobruja]]), especially around [[Constan\u021ba|Tomis]] spoke a ''sermo Theotiscus'' ('Germanic language'), the language of the Gothic translation of the Bible, and they used such a liturgy.<ref>\nAlice L.

Some writers even referred to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking people as Goths. However, it is clear from Ulfilas' translation that despite some puzzles the language belongs with the Germanic language group, not with Slavic.\n\nThe relationship between the language of the Crimean Goths and Ulfilas's Gothic is less clear. The few fragments of Crimean Gothic from the 16th century show significant differences from the language of the Gothic Bible although some of the glosses, such as ''ada'' for \"egg\", could indicate a common heritage, and Gothic ''m\u0113na'' (\"moon\"), compared to Crimean Gothic ''mine'', can suggest an East Germanic connection.\n\nGenerally, the Gothic language refers to the language of [[Ulfilas]], but the attestations themselves are largely from the 6th century, long after Ulfilas had died. The above list is not exhaustive, and a more extensive list is available on the website of the Wulfila project.\n\n==Alphabet and transliteration==\n{{Main|Gothic alphabet}}\n\nA few [[Gothic runic inscriptions]] were found across Europe, but due to early Christianization of the Goths, the Runic writing was quickly replaced by the newly invented Gothic alphabet.\n\nUlfilas's Gothic, as well as that of the ''Skeireins'' and various other manuscripts, was written using an alphabet that was most likely invented by Ulfilas himself for his translation.  Some scholars (such as Braune) claim that it was derived from the [[Greek alphabet]] only while others maintain that there are some Gothic letters of [[Runic]] or [[Latin]] origin.\n\nA standardized system is used for transliterating Gothic words into the [[Latin script]]. The system mirrors the conventions of the native alphabet, such as writing long {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} as ''ei''.  The Goths used their equivalents of ''e'' and ''o'' alone only for long higher vowels, using the digraphs ''ai'' and ''au'' (much as in [[French orthography|French]]) for the corresponding short or lower vowels. There are two variant spelling systems: a \"raw\" one that directly transliterates the original Gothic script and a \"normalized\" one that adds [[diacritic]]s ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s and [[acute accent]]s) to certain vowels to clarify the pronunciation or, in certain cases, to indicate the [[Proto-Germanic]] origin of the vowel in question. The latter system is usually used in the academic literature.\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for vowels:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It signals distinctions not made by Ulfilas in his alphabet. Rather, they reflect various origins in Proto-Germanic. Thus,\n** <big>''a\u00ed''</big> is used for the sound derived from the Proto-Germanic short vowels ''e'' and ''i'' before {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}.\n** <big>''\u00e1i''</big> is used for the sound derived from the Proto-Germanic diphthong ''ai''. Some scholars have considered this sound to have remained as a diphthong in Gothic. However, Ulfilas was highly consistent in other spelling inventions, which makes it unlikely that he assigned two different sounds to the same digraph. Furthermore, he consistently used the digraph to represent Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u03b9}}, which was then certainly a [[monophthong]]. A monophthongal value is accepted by [[Eduard Prokosch]] in his influential ''A Common Germanic Grammar''.<ref name=\"Prokosch\">Prokosch p. 105</ref> It had earlier been accepted by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] but only in an appendix to his ''Grammar of the Gothic Language''.<ref name=\"Wright\">Wright (1910 edition) p. 362</ref>\n** <big>''ai''</big> is used for the sound derived from the Common Germanic long vowel ''\u0113'' before a vowel.\n** <big>''\u00e1u''</big> is used for the sound derived from Common Germanic diphthong ''au''. It cannot be related to a Greek digraph, since {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u03c5}} then represented a sequence of a vowel and a spirant ([[fricative consonant|fricative]]) consonant, which Ulfilas transcribed as ''aw'' in representing Greek words. Nevertheless, the argument based on simplicity is accepted by some influential scholars.<ref name=\"Prokosch\"/><ref name=\"Wright\"/>\n*The \"normal environment of occurrence\" refers to native words. In foreign words, these environments are often greatly disturbed. For example, the short sounds {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} alternate in native words in a nearly allophonic way, with {{IPA|/\u025b/}} occurring in native words only before the consonants {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}}, {{IPA|/r/}} while {{IPA|/i/}} occurs everywhere else (nevertheless, there are a few exceptions such as {{IPA|/i/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} in ''hiri'', {{IPA|/\u025b/}} consistently in the [[reduplication|reduplicating]] syllable of certain past-tense verbs regardless of the following consonant, which indicate that these sounds had become phonemicized). In foreign borrowings, however, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur freely in all environments, reflecting the corresponding vowel quality in the source language.\n*Paradigmatic alterations can occur either intra-paradigm (between two different forms within a specific paradigm) or cross-paradigm (between the same form in two different paradigms of the same class).  Examples of intra-paradigm alternation are {{lang|got-Latn|gawi}} {{IPA|/\u0261a.wi/}} \"district ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|g\u00e1ujis}} {{IPA|/\u0261\u0254\u02d0.jis/}} \"district ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|mawi}} {{IPA|/ma.wi/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|m\u00e1uj\u014ds}} {{IPA|/m\u0254\u02d0.jo\u02d0s/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|\u00feiwi}} {{IPA|/\u03b8i.wi/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|\u00feiuj\u014ds}} {{IPA|/\u03b8iu.jo\u02d0s/}} \"maiden ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|taui}} {{IPA|/t\u0254\u02d0.i/}} \"deed ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|t\u014djis}} {{IPA|/to\u02d0.jis/}} \"deed ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|n\u00e1us}} {{IPA|/n\u0254\u02d0s/}} \"corpse ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|naweis}} {{IPA|/na.wi\u02d0s/}} \"corpses ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|triu}} {{IPA|/triu/}}?? \"tree ({{abbr|nom.|nominative}})\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|triwis}} {{IPA|/tri.wis/}} \"tree ({{abbr|gen.|genitive}})\"; {{lang|got-Latn|t\u00e1ujan}} {{IPA|/t\u0254\u02d0.jan/}} \"to do\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|tawida}} {{IPA|/ta.wi.\u00f0a/}} \"I/he did\"; {{lang|got-Latn|st\u014djan}} {{IPA|/sto\u02d0.jan/}} \"to judge\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|stauida}} {{IPA|/st\u0254\u02d0.i.\u00f0a/}} \"I/he judged\".  Examples of cross-paradigm alternation are Class IV verbs {{lang|got-Latn|qiman}} {{IPA|/k\u02b7iman/}} \"to come\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|ba\u00edran}} {{IPA|/b\u025bran/}} \"to carry\", {{lang|got-Latn|qumans}} {{IPA|/k\u02b7umans/}} \"(having) come\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|ba\u00farans}} {{IPA|/b\u0254rans/}} \"(having) carried\"; Class VIIb verbs {{lang|got-Latn|l\u0113tan}} {{IPA|/le\u02d0.tan/}} \"to let\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|saian}} {{IPA|/s\u025b\u02d0.an/}} \"to sow\" (note similar preterites {{lang|got-Latn|la\u00edl\u014dt}} {{IPA|/l\u025b.lo\u02d0t/}} \"I/he let\", {{lang|got-Latn|sa\u00eds\u014d}} {{IPA|/s\u025b.so\u02d0/}} \"I/he sowed\"). A combination of intra- and cross-paradigm alternation occurs in Class V {{lang|got-Latn|sniwan}} {{IPA|/sni.wan/}} \"to hasten\" vs. {{lang|got-Latn|sn\u00e1u}} {{IPA|/sn\u0254\u02d0/}} \"I/he hastened\" (expected *''snaw'', compare {{lang|got-Latn|qiman}} \"to come\", {{lang|got-Latn|qam}} \"I/he came\").\n*The carefully maintained alternations between ''iu'' and ''iw'' suggest that ''iu'' may have been something other than {{IPA|/iu/}}. Various possibilities have been suggested (for example, high central or high back unrounded vowels, such as {{IPA|[\u0268] [\u0289] [\u026f]}}); under these theories, the spelling of ''iu'' is derived from the fact that the sound alternates with ''iw'' before a vowel, based on the similar alternations ''au'' and ''aw''. The most common theory, however, simply posits {{IPA|/iu/}} as the pronunciation of ''iu''.\n*Macrons represent long ''\u0101'' and ''\u016b'' (however, long i appears as ''ei'', following the representation used in the native alphabet). Macrons are often also used in the case of ''\u0113'' and ''\u014d''; however, they are sometimes omitted since these vowels are always long.  Long ''\u0101'' occurs only before the consonants {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}} and represents [[Proto-Germanic]] nasalized {{IPA|/\u00e3\u02d0(h)/}} < earlier {{IPA|/a\u014b(h)/}}; non-nasal {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} did not occur in Proto-Germanic. It is possible that the Gothic vowel still preserved the nasalization, or else that the nasalization was lost but the length distinction kept, as has happened with [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] {{lang|lt|\u0105}}. Non-nasal {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} occurred in Proto-Germanic, however, and so long ''ei'' and ''\u016b'' occur in all contexts. Before {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/h\u02b7/}}, long ''ei'' and ''\u016b'' could stem from either non-nasal or nasal long vowels in Proto-Germanic; it is possible that the nasalization was still preserved in Gothic but not written.\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for consonants:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Furthermore, because Ulfilas tried to follow the original Greek text as much as possible in his translation, it is known that he used the same writing conventions as those of contemporary Greek. Since the Greek of that period is well documented, it is possible to reconstruct much of Gothic pronunciation from translated texts. In addition, the way in which non-Greek names are transcribed in the Greek Bible and in Ulfilas's Bible is very informative.\n\n===Vowels===\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Short vowels\n|-\n!\n!

Single vowels are sometimes long where a historically present [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] has been dropped in front of an {{IPA|/h/}} (a case of [[compensatory lengthening]]). Thus, the preterite of the verb ''briggan'' {{IPA|[bri\u014b\u0261an]}} \"to bring\" (English ''bring'', Dutch ''brengen'', German ''bringen'') becomes ''brahta'' {{IPA|[bra\u02d0xta]}} (English ''brought'', Dutch ''bracht'',  German ''brachte''), from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''branht\u0113''. In detailed [[transliteration]], when the intent is more [[phonetic transcription]], length is noted by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (or failing that, often a [[circumflex]]): ''br\u0101hta'', ''br\u00e2hta''. This is the only context in which {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} appears natively whereas {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}, like {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, is found often enough in other contexts: ''br\u016bks'' \"useful\" (Dutch ''gebruik'', German ''Gebrauch'', Icelandic ''br\u00fak'' \"use\").\n* {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} are long [[close-mid vowel]]s.

In transliterating Gothic, accents are placed on the second vowel of these digraphs ''a\u00ed'' and ''a\u00fa'' to distinguish them from the original diphthongs ''\u00e1i'' and ''\u00e1u'': ''ta\u00edhun'', ''da\u00fahtar''.

Researchers have disagreed over whether they were still pronounced as diphthongs {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/au\u032f/}} in Ulfilas's time (4th century) or had become long [[open-mid vowel]]s: {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}: ''ains'' {{IPA|[ains] / [\u025b\u02d0ns]}} \"one\" (German ''eins'', Icelandic ''einn''), ''augo'' {{IPA|[au\u0263o\u02d0] / [\u0254\u02d0\u0263o\u02d0]}} \"eye\" (German ''Auge'', Icelandic ''auga''). It is most likely that the latter view is correct, as it is indisputable that the digraphs {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} represent the sounds {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} in some circumstances (see below), and {{angle bracket|aj}} and {{angle bracket|aw}} were available to unambiguously represent the sounds {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/au\u032f/}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|aw}} is in fact used to represent {{IPA|/au/}} in foreign words (such as ''Pawlus'' \"Paul\"), and alternations between {{angle bracket|ai}}/{{angle bracket|aj}} and {{angle bracket|au}}/{{angle bracket|aw}} are scrupulously maintained in paradigms where both variants occur (e.g. ''taujan'' \"to do\" vs. past tense ''tawida'' \"did\"). Evidence from transcriptions of Gothic names into Latin suggests that the sound change had occurred very recently when Gothic spelling was standardized: Gothic names with Germanic ''au'' are rendered with ''au'' in Latin until the 4th century and ''o'' later on (''Austrogoti'' > ''Ostrogoti''). The digraphs {{angle bracket|ai}} and {{angle bracket|au}} are normally written with an accent on the first vowel (''\u00e1i, \u00e1u'') when they correspond to Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} and {{IPA|/au\u032f/}}.\n* Long {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}} also occur as allophones of {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0, o\u02d0/}} respectively before a following vowel: ''waian'' {{IPA|[w\u025b\u02d0an]}} \"to blow\" (Dutch ''waaien'', German ''wehen''), ''bauan'' {{IPA|[b\u0254\u02d0an]}} \"to build\" (Dutch ''bouwen'', German ''bauen'', Icelandic ''b\u00faa'' \"to live, reside\"), also in Greek words ''Trauada'' \"Troad\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03c1\u1ff3\u03ac\u03c2}}). In detailed transcription these are notated ''ai, au''.\n* {{IPA|/y/}} (pronounced like German ''\u00fc'' and French ''u'') is a Greek sound used only in borrowed words. It is transliterated as ''w'' (as it uses the same letter that otherwise denoted the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}): ''azwmus'' {{IPA|[azymus]}} \"unleavened bread\" ( < Gk. {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03b6\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}). It represents an \u03c5 (y) or the diphthong \u03bf\u03b9 (oi), both of which were pronounced {{IPA|[y]}} in the Greek of the time. Since the sound was foreign to Gothic, it was perhaps pronounced {{IPA|[i]}}.\n* {{IPA|/iu/}} is a falling [[diphthong]] ({{IPA|[iu\u032f]}}: ''diups'' {{IPA|[diu\u032fps]}} \"deep\" (Dutch ''diep'', German ''tief'', Icelandic ''dj\u00fapur'').\n* Greek diphthongs: In [[Ulfilas]]'s era, all the diphthongs of Classical Greek had become simple vowels in speech (''[[monophthong]]ization''), except for \u03b1\u03c5 (au) and \u03b5\u03c5 (eu), which were probably still pronounced {{IPA|[a\u03b2]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u03b2]}}. (They evolved into {{IPA|[av~af]}} and {{IPA|[ev~ef]}} in [[Modern Greek]].) Ulfilas notes them, in words borrowed from Greek, as ''aw'' and ''aiw'', probably pronounced {{IPA|[au\u032f, \u025bu\u032f]}}: ''Pawlus'' {{IPA|[pau\u032flus]}} \"Paul\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b1\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}), ''a\u00edwaggelista'' {{IPA|[\u025bwa\u014b\u0261e\u02d0lista]}} \"evangelist\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}, via the Latin ''evangelista'').\n* All vowels (including diphthongs) can be followed by a {{IPA|[w]}}, which was likely pronounced as the second element of a diphthong with roughly the sound of {{IPA|[u\u032f]}}. It seems likely that this is more of an instance of phonetic juxtaposition than of true diphthongs (such as, for example, the sound {{IPA|/aj/}} in the French word ''paille'' (\"straw\"), which is not the diphthong {{IPA|/ai\u032f/}} but rather a vowel followed by an [[approximant]]): ''alew'' {{IPA|[ale\u02d0w]}} \"olive oil\" ( < Latin ''oleum''), ''sn\u00e1iws'' {{IPA|[sn\u025b\u02d0ws]}} (\"snow\"), ''lasiws'' {{IPA|[lasiws]}} \"tired\" (English ''lazy'').\n\n===Consonants===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n!colspan=2|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=2|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=2|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!colspan=2|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!colspan=2|[[Labialized velar consonant|Labiovelar]]\n![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|colspan=2|''m'' {{IPA|/m/}}\n|colspan=2| &nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''n'' {{IPA|/n/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''g, n'' {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n![[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n| ''p'' {{IPA|/p/}}\n| ''b'' {{IPA|/b/}}\n|colspan=2| &nbsp;\n| ''t'' {{IPA|/t/}}\n| ''d'' {{IPA|/d/}}\n|&nbsp;\n| ''ddj?'' {{IPA|/\u025f\u02d0/}}\n| ''k'' {{IPA|/k/}}\n| ''g'' {{IPA|/\u0261/}}\n| ''q'' {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}\n| ''gw'' {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b7/}}\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n![[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n| ''f'' {{IPA|/\u0278/}}\n| ''b'' {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}\n| ''\u00fe'' {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}\n| ''d'' {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}\n| ''s'' {{IPA|/s/}}\n| ''z'' {{IPA|/z/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n| ''g, h'' {{IPA|[x]}}\n| ''g'' {{IPA|[\u0263]}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n| ''h'' {{IPA|/h/}}\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''l'' {{IPA|/l/}}\n|colspan=2|''j'' {{IPA|/j/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n| ''\u0195'' {{IPA|/\u028d/}}\n| ''w'' {{IPA|/w/}}\n|\n|-\n![[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|''r'' {{IPA|/r/}}\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|colspan=2|&nbsp;\n|&nbsp;\n|}\n\nIn general, Gothic consonants are [[final devoicing|devoiced]] at the ends of words. Gothic is rich in fricative consonants (although many of them may have been [[approximant]]s; it is hard to separate the two) derived by the processes described in [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] and characteristic of [[Germanic languages]]. Gothic is unusual among Germanic languages in having a {{IPA|/z/}} phoneme, which has not become {{IPA|/r/}} through rhotacization. Furthermore, the doubling of written consonants between vowels suggests that Gothic made distinctions between long and short, or [[gemination|geminated]] consonants: ''atta'' {{IPA|[at\u02d0a]}} \"dad\", ''kunnan'' {{IPA|[kun\u02d0an]}} \"to know\" (Dutch ''kennen'', German ''kennen'' \"to know\", Icelandic ''kunna'').\n\n====Stops====\n* The voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are regularly noted by ''p'', ''t'' and ''k'' respectively: ''paska'' {{IPA|[paska]}} \"Easter\" (from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1}}), ''tuggo'' {{IPA|[tu\u014b\u0261o\u02d0]}} \"tongue\", ''kalbo'' {{IPA|[kalbo\u02d0]}} \"calf\".\n* The letter ''q'' is probably a [[labialized voiceless velar plosive|voiceless labiovelar stop]], {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}, comparable to the Latin ''qu'': ''qiman'' {{IPA|[k\u02b7iman]}} \"to come\". In later Germanic languages, this phoneme has become either a [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/kw/}} of a [[voiceless velar stop]] + a [[labio-velar approximant]] (English ''qu'') or a simple voiceless velar stop {{IPA|/k/}} (English ''c, k'')\n* The voiced stops {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} are noted by the letters ''b'', ''d'' and ''g''. Like the other Germanic languages, they occurred in word-initial position, when doubled and after a nasal. In addition, they apparently occurred after other consonants,: ''arbi'' {{IPA|[arbi]}} \"inheritance\", ''huzd'' {{IPA|[huzd]}} \"treasure\". (This conclusion is based on their behavior at the end of a word, in which they do not change into voiceless fricatives, unlike when they occur after a vowel.)\n* There was probably also a [[voiced velar plosive|voiced labiovelar stop]], {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b7/}}, which was written with the digraph ''gw''. It occurred after a nasal, e.g. ''saggws'' {{IPA|[sa\u014b\u0261\u02b7s]}} \"song\", or long as a regular outcome of Germanic *''ww'': ''triggws'' {{IPA|[tri\u0261\u02b7\u02d0s]}} \"faithful\" (English ''true'', German ''treu'', Icelandic ''tryggur'').\n* Similarly, the letters ''ddj'', which is the regular outcome of Germanic *''jj'', may represent a voiced palatal stop, {{IPA|/\u025f\u02d0/}}: ''waddjus'' {{IPA|[wa\u025f\u02d0us]}} \"wall\" (Icelandic ''veggur''), ''twaddje'' {{IPA|[twa\u025f\u02d0e\u02d0]}} \"two (genitive)\" (Icelandic ''tveggja'').\n\n====Fricatives====\n* {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are usually written ''s'' and ''z''. The latter corresponds to Germanic *''z'' (which has become ''r'' or silent in the other Germanic languages); at the end of a word, it is regularly devoiced to ''s''. E.g. ''sa\u00edhs'' {{IPA|[s\u025bhs]}} \"six\", ''m\u00e1iza'' {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0za]}} \"greater\" (English ''more'', Dutch ''meer'', German ''mehr'', Icelandic ''meira'') versus ''m\u00e1is'' {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0s]}} \"more, rather\".\n* {{IPA|/\u0278/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, written ''f'' and ''\u00fe'', are voiceless bilabial and voiceless dental fricatives respectively. It is likely that the relatively unstable sound {{IPA|/\u0278/}} became {{IPA|/f/}}. ''f'' and ''\u00fe'' are also derived from ''b'' and ''d'' at the ends of words and then are devoiced and become approximants: ''gif'' {{IPA|[\u0261i\u0278]}} \"give (imperative)\" (infinitive ''giban'': German ''geben''), ''mi\u00fe'' {{IPA|[mi\u03b8]}} \"with\" ([[Old English language|Old English]] ''mid'', [[Old Norse]] ''me\u00f0'', Dutch ''met'', German ''mit''). The cluster {{IPA|/\u0278l/}} became {{IPA|/\u03b8l/}}: ''\u00felauhs'' \"flight\" from Germanic ''*flugiz''; ''\u00feliuhan'' \"flee\" from Germanic ''*fleuhan\u0105''. This sound change is unique among Germanic languages.\n* {{IPA|/h/}} is written as ''h'': ''haban'' \"to have\". It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[h]}} in word-final position and before a consonant as well (not {{IPA|[x]}}, since {{IPA|/\u0261/}} > {{IPA|[x]}} is written ''g'', not ''h''): ''jah'' {{IPA|[jah]}} \"and\" (Dutch, German, Scandinavian ''ja'' \"yes\").\n* {{IPA|[x]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/\u0261/}} at the end of a word or before a voiceless consonant; it is always written ''g'': ''dags'' {{IPA|[daxs]}} \"day\" (German ''Tag''). In some borrowed Greek words is the special letter ''x'', which represents the Greek letter \u03c7 (''ch''): ''Xristus'' {{IPA|[xristus]}} \"Christ\" (Gk. {{lang|grc|\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}). It may also have signified a {{IPA|/k/}}.\n* {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}, {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} and {{IPA|[\u0263]}} are voiced fricative found only in between vowels. They are [[allophones]] of {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and are not distinguished from them in writing. {{IPA|[\u03b2]}} may have become {{IPA|/v/}}, a more stable labiodental form. In the study of Germanic languages, these phonemes are usually transcribed as ''\u0180'', ''\u0111'' and ''\u01e5'' respectively: ''haban'' {{IPA|[ha\u03b2an]}} \"to have\", ''\u00feiuda'' {{IPA|[\u03b8iu\u032f\u00f0a]}} \"people\" (Dutch ''Diets'',  German ''Deutsch'', Icelandic ''\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0'' > English ''Dutch''), ''\u00e1ugo'' {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0\u0263o\u02d0]}} \"eye\" (English ''eye'', Dutch ''oog'', German ''Auge'', Icelandic ''auga''). When occurring after a vowel at the end of a word or before a voiceless consonant, these sounds become unvoiced {{IPA|[\u0278]}}, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} and {{IPA|[x]}}, e.g. ''hl\u00e1ifs'' {{IPA|[hl\u025b\u02d0\u0278s]}} \"loaf\" but genitive ''hl\u00e1ibis'' {{IPA|[hl\u025b\u02d0\u03b2is]}} \"of a loaf\", plural ''hl\u00e1ib\u014ds'' {{IPA|[hl\u025b\u02d0\u03b2o\u02d0s]}} \"loaves\".\n* ''\u0195'' (also transcribed ''hw'') is the labiovelar equivalent of {{IPA|/x/}}, derived from Proto-Indo-European *k\u02b7. It was probably pronounced {{IPA|[\u028d]}} (a voiceless {{IPA|[w]}}), as ''wh'' is pronounced in certain dialects of English and in Scots: ''\u0195an'' {{IPA|/\u028dan/}} \"when\", ''\u0195ar'' {{IPA|/\u028dar/}} \"where\", ''\u0195eits'' {{IPA|[\u028di\u02d0ts]}} \"white\".\n\n====Sonorants====\nGothic has three nasal consonants, one of which is an allophone of the others, all found only in [[complementary distribution]] with them. Nasals in Gothic, like most other languages, are pronounced at the same [[point of articulation]] as either the consonant that follows them ([[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]). Therefore, clusters like {{IPA|[md]}} and {{IPA|[nb]}} are not possible.\n* {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} are freely distributed and so can be found in any position in a syllable and form [[minimal pair]]s except in certain contexts where they are neutralized: {{IPA|/n/}} before a [[bilabial consonant]] becomes {{IPA|[m]}}, while {{IPA|/m/}} preceding a [[Dental consonant|dental stop]] becomes {{IPA|[n]}}, as per the principle of assimilation described in the previous paragraph. In front of a [[velar consonant|velar stop]], they both become {{IPA|[\u014b]}}. {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} are transcribed as ''n'' and ''m'', and, in writing, neutralisation is marked: ''sniumundo'' {{IPA|/sniu\u032fmundo\u02d0/}} (\"quickly\").\n* {{IPA|[\u014b]}} is not a phoneme and cannot appear freely in Gothic. It is present where a nasal consonant is neutralised before a velar stop and is in a complementary distribution with {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. Following Greek conventions, it is normally written as ''g'' (sometimes ''n''): ''\u00feagkjan'' {{IPA|[\u03b8a\u014bkjan]}} \"to think\", ''sigqan'' {{IPA|[si\u014bk\u02b7an]}} \"to sink\" ~ ''\u00feankei\u00fe'' {{IPA|[\u03b8a\u014bki\u02d0\u03b8]}} \"thinks\". The cluster ''ggw'' sometimes denotes {{IPA|[\u014b\u0261\u02b7]}}, but sometimes {{IPA|[\u0261\u02b7\u02d0]}} (see above).\n* {{IPA|/w/}} is transliterated as ''w'' before a vowel: ''weis'' {{IPA|[wi\u02d0s]}} (\"we\"), ''tw\u00e1i'' {{IPA|[twai]}} \"two\" (German ''zwei'').\n* {{IPA|/j/}} is written as ''j'': ''jer'' {{IPA|[je\u02d0r]}} \"year\", ''sakjo'' {{IPA|[sakjo\u02d0]}} \"strife\".\n* {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} occur as in other European languages: ''laggs'' (possibly {{IPA|[la\u014b\u0261s]}}, {{IPA|[la\u014bks]}} or {{IPA|[la\u014b\u0261z]}}) \"long\", ''mel'' {{IPA|[me\u02d0l]}} \"hour\" (English ''meal'', Dutch ''maal'', German ''Mahl'', Icelandic ''m\u00e1l'').  The exact pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} is unknown, but it is usually assumed to be a [[Trill consonant|trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} or a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}): ''ra\u00edhts'' {{IPA|[r\u025bxts]}} \"right\", ''afar'' {{IPA|[afar]}} \"after\".\n* {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} may occur either between two other consonants of lower sonority or word-finally after a consonant of lower sonority. It is probable that the sounds are pronounced partly or completely as [[syllabic consonant]]s in such circumstances (as in English \"bottle\" or \"bottom\"): ''tagl'' {{IPA|[ta\u0263l\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[ta\u0263l]}} \"hair\" (English ''tail'', Icelandic ''tagl''), ''m\u00e1i\u00fems'' {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0\u03b8m\u0329s]}} or {{IPA|[m\u025b\u02d0\u03b8ms]}} \"gift\", ''t\u00e1ikns'' {{IPA|[t\u025b\u02d0kn\u0329s]}} or {{IPA|[t\u025b\u02d0kns]}} \"sign\" (English ''token'', Dutch ''teken'', German ''Zeichen'', Icelandic ''t\u00e1kn'') and ''tagr'' {{IPA|[ta\u0263r\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[ta\u0263r]}} \"tear (as in crying)\".\n\n===Accentuation and intonation===\nAccentuation in Gothic can be reconstructed through phonetic comparison, [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]]. Gothic used a [[stress accent]] rather than the [[pitch accent]] of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. This is indicated by the shortening of long vowels {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} and the loss of short vowels {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} in unstressed final syllables.\n\nJust as in other [[Germanic languages]], the free moving [[Proto-Indo-European accent]] was replaced with one fixed on the first syllable of simple words. Accents do not shift when words are [[inflection|inflected]]. In most compound words, the location of the stress depends on the type of compound:\n\n* In compounds in which the second word is a ''noun'', the accent is on the first syllable of the first word of the compound.\n* In compounds in which the second word is a ''verb'', the accent falls on the first syllable of the verbal component. Elements prefixed to verbs are otherwise unstressed except in the context of separable words (words that can be broken in two parts and separated in regular usage such as [[separable verb]]s in German and Dutch). In those cases, the prefix is stressed.\n\nFor example, with comparable words from modern Germanic languages:\n* Non-compound words: ''marka'' {{IPA|[\u02c8marka]}} \"border, borderlands\" (English ''march'', Dutch ''mark''); ''aftra'' {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u0278tra]}} \"after\"; ''bidjan'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u00f0jan]}} \"pray\" (Dutch, ''bidden'', German ''bitten'', Icelandic ''bi\u00f0ja'', English ''bid'').\n* Compound words:\n** Noun first element: ''guda-l\u00e1us'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261u\u00f0al\u0254\u02d0s]}} \"godless\".\n** Verb second element: ''ga-l\u00e1ubjan'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0\u03b2jan]}} \"believe\" (Dutch ''geloven'', German ''glauben'' < [[Old High German]] ''g(i)louben'' by [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] of the unaccented ''i'').\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Nouns and adjectives====\n{{Main|Gothic declension}}\nGothic preserves many archaic Indo-European features that are not always present in modern Germanic languages, in particular the rich Indo-European [[declension]] system. Gothic had [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative case]]s, as well as vestiges of a [[vocative case]] that was sometimes identical to the nominative and sometimes to the accusative. The three [[grammatical gender|genders]] of Indo-European were all present. Nouns and adjectives were inflected according to one of two [[grammatical number]]s: the singular and the plural.\n\nNouns can be divided into numerous declensions according to the form of the stem: ''a'', ''\u014d'', ''i'', ''u'', ''an'', ''\u014dn'', ''ein'', ''r'', etc. Adjectives have two variants, ''indefinite'' and ''definite'' (sometimes ''indeterminate'' and ''determinate''), with definite adjectives normally used in combination with the definite [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s (such as the [[definite article]] ''sa''/''\u00feata''/''s\u014d'') while indefinite adjectives are used in other circumstances.,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ratkus |first1=Art\u016bras |title=Weak adjectives need not be definite |journal=Indogermanische Forschungen |date=1 August 2018 |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=27\u201364 |doi=10.1515/if-2018-0002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ratkus |first1=Art\u016bras |title=This is not the same: the ambiguity of a Gothic adjective |journal=Folia Linguistica Historica |date=25 October 2018 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=475\u2013494 |doi=10.1515/flih-2018-0017}}</ref> Indefinite adjectives generally use a combination of ''a''-stem and ''\u014d''-stem endings, and definite adjectives use a combination of ''an''-stem and ''\u014dn''-stem endings. The concept of \"strong\" and \"weak\" declensions that is prevalent in the grammar of many other [[Germanic languages]] is less significant in Gothic because of its conservative nature: the so-called \"weak\" declensions (those ending in ''n'') are, in fact, no weaker in Gothic (in terms of having fewer endings) than the \"strong\" declensions (those ending in a vowel), and the \"strong\" declensions do not form a coherent class that can be clearly distinguished from the \"weak\" declensions.\n\nAlthough descriptive adjectives in Gothic (as well as superlatives ending in ''-ist'' and ''-ost'') and the [[past participle]] may take both definite and indefinite forms, some adjectival words are restricted to one variant. Some pronouns take only definite forms: for example, ''sama'' (English \"same\"), adjectives like ''un\u0195eila'' (\"constantly\", from the root ''\u0195eila'', \"time\"; compare to the English \"while\"), comparative adjective and [[present participle]]s. Others, such as ''\u00e1ins'' (\"some\"), take only the indefinite forms.\n\nThe table below displays the declension of the Gothic adjective ''blind'' (English: \"blind\"), compared with the ''an''-stem noun ''guma'' \"man, human\" and the ''a''-stem noun ''dags'' \"day\":\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Number\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Case\n! colspan=\"5\" | Definite/''an''-stem\n! colspan=\"5\" | Indefinite/''a''-stem\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Noun\n! colspan=\"4\" | Adjective\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Noun\n! colspan=\"4\" | Adjective\n|-\n! style=\"height:58px;\"| root\n! {{abbr|masc.|masculine}}\n! {{abbr|neut.|neuter}}\n! {{abbr|fem.|feminine}}\n! root\n! {{abbr|masc.|masculine}}\n! {{abbr|neut.|neuter}}\n! {{abbr|fem.|feminine}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | Singular\n| ''{{abbr|nom.|nominative}}'' || guma\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:middle;\" | blind-\n| -a || colspan=\"2\" | -o || dags\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:middle;\" | blind-\n| -s || rowspan=\"2\" | \u2014 / -ata || rowspan=\"2\" | -a\n|-\n| ''{{abbr|acc.|accusative}}'' || guman || -an || -o || rowspan=\"2\" | -on\n| dag || -ana \n|-\n| ''{{abbr|dat.|dative}}'' || gumin || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -in|| daga\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| -amma || -\u00e1i\n|-\n| ''{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}'' || gumins || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -ins\n| rowspan=\"3\" | -ons || dagis\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| -is || \u00e1izos\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" | Plural\n| ''{{abbr|nom.|nominative}}'' || rowspan=\"2\" | gumans\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -ans || rowspan=\"2\" | -ona || dagos\n| -\u00e1i || rowspan=\"2\" | -a || rowspan=\"2\" | -os\n|-\n| ''{{abbr|acc.|accusative}}'' \n| dagans || -ans \n|-\n| ''{{abbr|dat.|dative}}'' || gumam || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -am\n| -om || dagam\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -\u00e1im \n|-\n| ''{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}'' || gumane || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -ane\n| -ono || dage || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | -\u00e1ize\n| -\u00e1izo\n|}\n\nThis table is, of course, not exhaustive.  (There are secondary inflexions of various sorts not described here.) An exhaustive table of only the ''types'' of endings that Gothic took is presented below.\n\n* '''vowel declensions''':\n** roots ending in ''-a'', ''-ja'', ''-wa'' (masculine and neuter): equivalent to the Greek and Latin second declension in ''\u2011us'' / ''\u2011\u012b'' and \u2011\u03bf\u03c2 / \u2011\u03bf\u03c5;\n** roots ending in ''-\u014d'', ''-j\u014d'' and ''-w\u014d'' (feminine): equivalent to the Greek and Latin first declension in ''\u2011a'' / ''\u2011ae'' and \u2011\u03b1 / \u2011\u03b1\u03c2 (\u2011\u03b7 / \u2011\u03b7\u03c2);\n** roots ending in ''-i'' (masculine and feminine): equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''\u2011is'' / ''\u2011is'' ({{abbr|abl.|ablative}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''\u2011\u012b'', {{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''-ium'') and \u2011\u03b9\u03c2 / \u2011\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2;\n** roots ending in ''-u'' (all three genders): equivalent to the Latin fourth declension in ''\u2011us'' / ''\u2011\u016bs'' and the Greek third declension in \u2011\u03c5\u03c2 / \u2011\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2;\n* '''''n''-stem declensions''', equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''\u2011\u014d'' / ''\u2011inis/\u014dnis'' and \u2011\u03c9\u03bd / \u2011\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 or \u2011\u03b7\u03bd / \u2011\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2:\n** roots ending in ''-an'', ''-jan'', ''-wan'' (masculine);\n** roots ending in ''-\u014dn'' and ''-ein'' (feminine);\n** roots ending in ''-n'' (neuter): equivalent to the Greek and Latin third declension in ''\u2011men'' / ''\u2011minis'' and \u2011\u03bc\u03b1 / \u2011\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2;\n* '''minor declensions''': roots ending in ''-r'', ''-nd'' and vestigial endings in other consonants, equivalent to other third declensions in Greek and Latin.\n\nGothic adjectives follow noun declensions closely; they take same types of inflexion.\n\n====Pronouns====\n{{Main|Gothic declension#Pronouns|l1=Gothic declension: Pronouns}}\nGothic inherited the full set of Indo-European pronouns: [[personal pronoun]]s (including [[reflexive pronoun]]s for each of the three [[grammatical person]]s), [[possessive pronoun]]s, both simple and compound [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstratives]], [[relative pronoun]]s, [[interrogative pronoun|interrogatives]] and [[indefinite pronoun]]s. Each follows a particular pattern of inflexion (partially mirroring the noun declension), much like other Indo-European languages. One particularly noteworthy characteristic is the preservation of the [[dual grammatical number|dual number]], referring to two people or things; the plural was used only for quantities greater than two. Thus, \"the two of us\" and \"we\" for numbers greater than two were expressed as ''wit'' and ''weis'' respectively. While [[Proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] used the dual for all grammatical categories that took a number (as did Classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]), most Old Germanic languages are unusual in that they preserved it only for pronouns.  Gothic preserves an older system with dual marking on both pronouns and verbs (but not nouns or adjectives).\n\nThe simple demonstrative pronoun ''sa'' (neuter: ''\u00feata'', feminine: ''so'', from the Indo-European root ''*so'', ''*seh<sub>2</sub>'', ''*tod''; cognate to the [[Greek language|Greek]] article \u1f41, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc and the [[Latin]] ''is'''tud''''') can be used as an article, allowing constructions of the type ''definite article + weak adjective + noun''.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns begin with ''\u0195-'', which derives from the proto-Indo-European consonant ''*k\u02b7'' that was present at the beginning of all interrogratives in proto-Indo-European.  That is cognate with the ''wh-'' at the beginning of many English interrogative, which, as in Gothic, are pronounced with {{IPA|[\u028d]}} in some dialects. The same etymology is present in the interrogatives of many other Indo-European languages\": ''w-'' {{IPA|[v]}} in [[German language|German]], ''hv-'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], the [[Latin]] ''qu-'' (which persists in modern [[Romance languages]]), the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c4- or \u03c0-, the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] ''k-'' as well as many others.\n\n====Verbs====\n{{Main|Gothic verbs}}\nThe bulk of Gothic verbs follow the type of Indo-European conjugation called '[[thematic stem|thematic]]' because they insert a vowel derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European phonemes ''*e'' or ''*o'' between roots and inflexional suffixes. The pattern is also present in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]:\n*Latin - ''leg-i-mus'' (\"we read\"): root ''leg-'' + thematic vowel ''-i-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-mus''.\n*Greek - \u03bb\u03cd-\u03bf-\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (\"we untie\"): root \u03bb\u03c5- + thematic vowel -\u03bf- + suffix -\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\n*Gothic - ''nim-a-m'' (\"we take\"):  root ''nim-'' + thematic vowel ''-a-'' (from ''*o'') + suffix ''-m''.\n\nThe other conjugation, called '[[athematic]]', in which suffixes are added directly to roots, exists only in unproductive vestigial forms in Gothic, just like in Greek and Latin. The most important such instance is [[Indo-European copula|the verb \"to be\"]], which is athematic in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and many other Indo-European languages.\n\nGothic verbs are, like nouns and adjectives, divided into strong verbs and weak verbs. Weak verbs are characterised by [[preterite]]s formed by appending the suffixes ''-da'' or ''-ta'', parallel to past participles formed with ''-\u00fe'' / ''-t''. Strong verbs form preterites by [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] (the alternating of vowels in their root forms) or by [[reduplication]] (prefixing the root with the first consonant in the root plus ''a\u00ed'') but without adding a suffix in either case. That parallels the Greek and Sanskrit [[perfect (grammar)|perfects]].  The dichotomy is still present in modern Germanic languages:\n* weak verbs (\"to have\"):\n** Gothic: ''haban'', preterite: ''hab\u00e1i'''da''''', past participle: ''hab\u00e1i'''\u00fe'''s'';\n** English: ''(to) have'', preterite: ''ha'''d''''', past participle: ''ha'''d''''';\n** German: ''haben'', preterite: ''hat'''te''''', past participle: ''gehab'''t''''';\n** Icelandic: ''hafa'', preterite: ''haf'''\u00f0i''''', past participle: ''haf'''t''''';\n** Dutch: ''hebben'', preterite: ''ha'''d''''', past participle: ''geha'''d''''';\n** Swedish: ''ha(va)'', preterite: ''ha'''d'''e'', supine: ''haf'''t''''';\n* strong verbs (\"to give\"):\n** Gothic: infinitive: ''g'''i'''ban'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';\n** English: infinitive: ''(to) g'''i'''ve'', preterite: ''g'''a'''ve'';\n** German: infinitive: ''g'''e'''ben'', preterite: ''g'''a'''b'';\n** Icelandic: infinitive: ''g'''e'''fa'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';\n** Dutch: infinitive: ''g'''e'''ven'', preterite: ''g'''a'''f'';\n** Swedish: infinitive: ''g'''i'''va'' (''ge''), preterite: ''g'''a'''v''.\n\nVerbal conjugation in Gothic have two [[grammatical voice]]s: the active and the medial; three numbers: singular, dual (except in the third person) and plural; two tenses: present and preterite (derived from a former perfect); three [[grammatical mood]]s: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (from an old [[optative mood|optative]] form) and [[imperative mood|imperative]] as well as three kinds of nominal forms: a present [[infinitive]], a present [[participle]], and a past [[passive voice|passive]]. Not all tenses and persons are represented in all moods and voices, as some conjugations use [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary forms]].\n\nFinally, there are forms called 'preterite-present': the old Indo-European perfect was reinterpreted as present tense. The Gothic word ''w\u00e1it'', from the proto-Indo-European ''*woid-h<sub>2</sub>e'' (\"to see\" in the perfect), corresponds exactly to its Sanskrit cognate ''v\u00e9da'' and in Greek to \u03dd\u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1. Both etymologically should mean \"I have seen\" (in the perfect sense) but mean \"I know\" (in the preterite-present meaning). Latin follows the same rule with ''n\u014du\u012b'' (\"I have learned\" and \"I know\"). The preterite-present verbs include ''\u00e1igan'' (\"to possess\") and ''kunnan'' (\"to know\") among others.\n\n===Syntax===\n\n==== Word order ====\nThe word order of Gothic is fairly free as is typical of other inflected languages. The natural word order of Gothic is assumed to have been like that of the other old Germanic languages; however, nearly all extant Gothic texts are translations of Greek originals and have been heavily influenced by Greek syntax.\n\nSometimes what can be expressed in one word in the original Greek will require a verb and a complement in the Gothic translation; for example, \u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03c7\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 (''di\u014dchth\u0113sontai'', \"they will be persecuted\") is rendered:\n:{|\n|''wrakos''||''winnand''||(2 Timothy 3:12)\n|-\n|persecution-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}-{{abbr|{{sc|acc}}|accusative}}||suffer-{{abbr|{{sc|3pl}}|third person plural}}\n|-\n|colspan=3|\"they will suffer persecution\"\n|}\nLikewise Gothic translations of Greek noun phrases may feature a verb and a complement. In both cases, the verb follows the complement, giving weight to the theory that basic word order in Gothic is object\u2013verb. This aligns with what is known of other early Germanic languages.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyth\u00f3rsson |first=Th\u00f3rhallur |editor-last1=Thr\u00e1insson |editor-first1=H\u00f6skuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=109\u201310 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this pattern is reversed in imperatives and negations:<ref name=\"Eyth\u00f3rsson 2001 110\">{{cite book |last=Eyth\u00f3rsson |first=Th\u00f3rhallur |editor-last1=Thr\u00e1insson |editor-first1=H\u00f6skuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=110 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n:{|\n|''wa\u00edr\u00fe''||''hr\u00e1ins''||(Matthew 8:3, Mark 1:42, Luke 5:13)\n|-\n|become-{{abbr|{{sc|imp}}|imperative}}||clean\n|-\n|colspan=3|\"become clean!\"\n|}\n\n:{|\n|''ni''||''nimi\u00fe''||''arbi''||(Galatians 4:30)\n|-\n|not||take-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person single}}||inheritance\n|-\n|colspan=4|\"he shall not become heir\"\n|}\nAnd in a ''wh''-question the verb directly follows the question word:<ref name=\"Eyth\u00f3rsson 2001 110\"/>\n:{|\n|''\u0195a''||''skuli''||''\u00feata''||''barn''||''wa\u00edr\u00fean''||(''Luke 1:66'')\n|-\n|what||shall-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person single}}-{{abbr|{{sc|opt}}|optative}}||the-{{abbr|{{sc|neut}}|neuter}}||child||become-{{abbr|{{sc|inf}}|infinitive}}\n|-\n|colspan=6|\"What shall the child become?\"\n|}\n\n====Clitics====\nGothic has two [[clitic]] particles placed in the second position in a sentence, in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]].\n\nOne such clitic particle is -''u'', indicating a yes\u2013no question or an indirect question, like Latin -''ne'':\n\n:{|\n|''ni-'''u'''''||''ta\u00edhun''||''\u00fe\u00e1i''||''gahr\u00e1inid\u00e1i''||''wa\u00far\u00feun?''||(Luke 17:17)\n|-\n|not-'''{{abbr|{{sc|q}}|question}}'''||ten||that-{{abbr|{{sc|masc}}|masculine}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}||cleanse-{{abbr|{{sc|pp}}|past participle}}-{{abbr|{{sc|masc}}|masculine}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pl}}|plural}}||become-{{abbr|{{sc|3pl}}|third person plural}}-{{abbr|{{sc|pst}}|past}}\n|-\n|colspan=6|\"Were there not ten that were cleansed?\"\n|}\n:{|\n|''ei''||''sa\u00ed\u0195am''||''qim\u00e1i-'''u'''''||''Helias''||''nasjan''||''ina''||(Matthew 27:49)\n|-\n|that||see-{{abbr|{{sc|1pl}}|first person plural}}||come-{{abbr|{{sc|3sg}}|third person singular}}-{{abbr|{{sc|opt}}|optative}}-'''{{abbr|{{sc|q}}|question}}'''||Elias||save-{{abbr|{{sc|inf}}|infinitive}}||he-{{abbr|{{sc|acc}}|accusative}}\n|-\n|colspan=7|\"that we see whether or not Elias will come to save him\"\n|}\n\nThe prepositional phrase without the clitic -''u'' appears as ''af \u00feus silbin'': the clitic causes the reversion of originally voiced fricatives, unvoiced at the end of a word, to their voiced form; another such example is ''wileid-u'' \"do you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) want\" from ''wilei\u00fe'' \"you ({{abbr|pl.|plural}}) want\". If the first word has a [[preverb]] attached, the clitic actually splits the preverb from the verb: ''ga-u-l\u00e1ubjats'' \"do you both believe...?\" from ''gal\u00e1ubjats'' \"you both believe\".\n\nAnother such clitic is ''-uh'' \"and\", appearing as ''-h'' after a vowel: ''ga-h-m\u0113lida'' \"and he wrote\" from ''gam\u0113lida'' \"he wrote\", ''urreis nim-uh'' \"arise and take!\" from the imperative form ''nim'' \"take\".  After ''i\u00fe'' or any indefinite besides ''sums'' \"some\" and ''an\u00fear'' \"another\", -''uh'' cannot be placed; in the latter category, this is only because indefinite [[determiner phrases]] cannot move to the front of a clause. Unlike, for example, Latin -''que'', -''uh'' can only join two or more main clauses. In all other cases, the word ''jah'' \"and\" is used, which can also join main clauses.\n\nMore than one such clitics can occur in one word: ''diz-uh-\u00fean-sat ij\u014ds'' \"and then he seized them ({{abbr|fem.|feminine}})\" from ''dissat'' \"he seized\" (notice again the voicing of ''diz-''), ''ga-u-\u0195a-s\u0113\u0195i'' \"whether he saw anything\" from ''gas\u0113\u0195i'' \"he saw\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Eyth\u00f3rsson |first=Th\u00f3rhallur |editor-last1=Thr\u00e1insson |editor-first1=H\u00f6skuldur |editor-last2=Epstein |editor-first2=Samuel David |editor-last3=Peter |editor-first3=Stever |title=Studies in Comparative Germanic Syntax |volume=II |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |date=2001 |pages=117\u201318, 122 |chapter=Functional Categories, Cliticization, and Verb Movement in the Early Germanic Languages |isbn=978-1-402-00294-6 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other Germanic languages==\nFor the most part, Gothic is known to be significantly closer to Proto-Germanic than any other Germanic language except for that of the (scantily attested) early Norse runic inscriptions, which has made it invaluable in the reconstruction of Proto-Germanic. In fact, Gothic tends to serve as the primary foundation for reconstructing Proto-Germanic. The reconstructed Proto-Germanic conflicts with Gothic only when there is clearly identifiable evidence from other branches that the Gothic form is a secondary development.\n\n===Distinctive features===\nGothic fails to display a number of innovations shared by all Germanic languages attested later:\n* lack of [[Germanic umlaut]],\n* lack of [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].\n\nThe language has also preserved many features that have been lost mostly in other early Germanic languages:\n* dual inflections on verbs,\n* morphological passive voice for verbs,\n* reduplication in the past tense of Class VII strong verbs,\n* clitic conjunctions that appear in second position of a sentence in accordance with [[Wackernagel's Law]], splitting verbs from pre-verbs.\n\n====Lack of umlaut====\nMost conspicuously, Gothic shows no sign of morphological [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]]. Gothic ''fotus'', {{abbr|pl.|plural}} ''fotjus'', can be contrasted with English ''foot'' : ''feet'', German ''Fu\u00df'' : ''F\u00fc\u00dfe'', Old Norse ''f\u00f3tr'' : ''f\u0153tr'', Danish ''fod'' : ''f\u00f8dder''. These forms contain the characteristic change {{IPA|/u/}} > {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} (English), {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} > {{IPA|/y\u02d0/}} (German), {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} > {{IPA|/\u00f8\u02d0/}} (ON and Danish) due to i-umlaut; the Gothic form shows no such change.\n\n====Lack of rhotacism====\nProto-Germanic ''*z'' remains in Gothic as ''z'' or is devoiced to ''s''. In North and West Germanic, ''*z'' changes to ''r'' by [[Rhotacism (sound change)#Germanic languages|rhotacism]]:\n* Gothic ''dius'', [[genitive case|{{abbr|gen.|genitive}}]] {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''diuzis'' \u2260\n* Old English ''d\u0113or'', {{abbr|gen.|genitive}} {{abbr|sg.|singular}} ''d\u0113ores'' \"wild animal\" (Modern English ''deer'').\n\n====Passive voice====\nGothic retains a morphological passive voice inherited from Indo-European but unattested in all other Germanic languages except for the single fossilised form preserved in, for example, Old English ''h\u0101tte'' or Runic Norse ({{circa|400}}) ''hait\u0113'' \"am called\", derived from Proto-Germanic ''*haitan\u0105'' \"to call, command\". (The related verbs ''hei\u00dfen'' in modern German and ''heten'' in Dutch are both derived from the active voice of this verb but have the passive meaning \"to be called\" alongside the dated active meaning \"to command\".)\n\nThe morphological passive in North Germanic languages (Swedish ''g\u00f6r'' \"does\", ''g\u00f6rs'' \"is being done\") originates from the [[Old Norse]] [[Old Norse morphology#Suffixes and clitics|middle voice]], which is an innovation not inherited from Indo-European.\n\n====Dual number====\nUnlike other Germanic languages, which retained [[dual grammatical number|dual number]] marking only in some pronoun forms, Gothic has dual forms both in pronouns and in verbs. Dual verb forms exist in the first and second person only and only in the active voice; in all other cases, the corresponding plural forms are used.  In pronouns, Gothic has first and second person dual pronouns: Gothic and Old English ''wit'', Old Norse ''vit'' \"we two\" (thought to have been in fact derived from ''*wi-du'' literally \"we two\").\n\n====Reduplication====\nGothic possesses a number of verbs which form their preterite by reduplication, another archaic feature inherited from Indo-European. While traces of this category survived elsewhere in Germanic, the phenomenon is largely obscured in these other languages by later sound changes and analogy. In the following examples the infinitive is compared to the third person singular preterite indicative:\n\n* Gothic ''saian'' \"to sow\" : '''''sai'''so''\n* Old Norse ''s\u00e1'' : '''''se'''ri'' < Proto-Germanic *'''''se'''z\u014d''\n* Gothic ''laikan'' \"to play\" : ''lailaik''\n* Old English ''l\u0101can'' : '''''leo'''lc'', ''l\u0113c''\n\n===Classification===\nThe standard theory of the origin of the Germanic languages divides the languages into three groups: [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (Gothic and a few other very scantily-attested languages), [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] and its derivatives, such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]) and [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (all others, including [[Old English]], [[Old High German]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old Low Franconian]], [[Old Frisian]] and the numerous modern languages derived from these, including [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]). Sometimes, a further grouping, that of the [[Northwest Germanic]] languages, is posited as containing the North Germanic and West Germanic languages, reflecting the hypothesis that Gothic was the first attested language to branch off.\n\nA minority opinion (the so-called Gotho-Nordic Hypothesis) instead groups North Germanic and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] together. It is based partly on historical claims: for example, [[Jordanes]], writing in the 6th century, ascribes to the Goths a Scandinavian origin. There are a few linguistically significant areas in which Gothic and Old Norse agree against the West Germanic languages.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is the evolution of the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''-jj-'' and *''-ww-'' into Gothic ''ddj'' (from Pre-Gothic ''ggj''?) and ''ggw'', and Old Norse ''ggj'' and ''ggv'' (\"[[Holtzmann's Law]]\"), in contrast to West Germanic where they remained as semivowels. Compare Modern English ''true'', German ''treu'', with Gothic ''triggws'', Old Norse ''tryggr''.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that these are, in fact, two separate and unrelated changes.<ref>{{Cite book |first=J. B. |last=Voyles |title=Early Germanic Grammar |year=1992 |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |pages=25\u201326 |isbn=0-12-728270-X}}\n</ref> A number of other posited similarities exist (for example, the existence of numerous inchoative verbs ending in -''na'', such as Gothic ''ga-waknan'', Old Norse ''vakna''; and the absence of gemination before ''j'', or (in the case of old Norse) only ''g'' geminated before ''j'', e.g. Proto-Germanic *''kunj\u0105'' > Gothic ''kuni'' (kin), Old Norse ''kyn'', but Old English ''cynn'', Old High German ''kunni''). However, for the most part these represent [[Comparative method#Terminology|shared retentions]], which are not valid means of grouping languages. That is, if a parent language splits into three daughters A, B and C, and C innovates in a particular area but A and B do not change, A and B will appear to agree against C. That shared retention in A and B is not necessarily indicative of any special relationship between the two.\n\nSimilar claims of similarities between [[Old Gutnish]] (''Gutniska'') and [[Old Icelandic]] are also based on shared retentions rather than shared innovations.\n\nAnother commonly-given example involves Gothic and Old Norse verbs with the ending ''-t'' in the 2nd person singular preterite indicative, and the West Germanic languages have ''-i''.  The ending ''-t'' can regularly descend from the Proto-Indo-European perfect ending ''*-th\u2082e'', while the origin of the West Germanic ending ''-i'' (which, unlike the ''-t''-ending, unexpectedly combines with the zero-grade of the root as in the plural) is unclear, suggesting that it is an innovation of some kind, possibly an import from the optative. Another possibility is that this is an example of independent choices made from a doublet existing in the proto-language.  That is, Proto-Germanic may have allowed either ''-t'' or ''-i'' to be used as the ending, either in [[free variation]] or perhaps depending on dialects within Proto-Germanic or the particular verb in question. Each of the three daughters independently standardized on one of the two endings and, by chance, Gothic and Old Norse ended up with the same ending.\n\nOther [[isogloss]]es have led scholars to propose an early split between East and [[Northwest Germanic]]. Furthermore, features shared by any two branches of Germanic do not necessarily require the postulation of a [[proto-language]] excluding the third, as the early [[Germanic languages]] were all part of a [[dialect continuum]] in the early stages of their development, and [[language contact|contact]] between the three branches of Germanic was extensive.\n\nPolish linguist [[Witold Ma\u0144czak]] had argued that Gothic is closer to German (specifically [[Upper German]]) than to Scandinavian and suggests that their ancestral homeland was located southernmost part of the Germanic territories, close to present day Austria rather than in Scandinavia. [[Frederik Kortlandt]] has agreed with Ma\u0144czak's hypothesis, stating: \"I think that his argument is correct and that it is time to abandon Iordanes' classic view that the Goths came from Scandinavia.\"<ref name=\"Kortlandt\">[http://kortlandt.nl/publications/art198e.pdf Kortlandt, \"The origin of the Goths\"]</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nThe reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic]] language features several apparent [[Proto-Slavic borrowings|borrowed words]] from East Germanic (presumably Gothic), such as ''xl\u011bb\u044a'', \"bread\", vs. Gothic ''hlaifs''.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Holzer\n| first1                = Georg\n| authorlink1           = Georg Holzer\n| title                 = Germanische Lehnw\u00f6rter im Urslavischen: Methodologisches zu ihrer Identifizierung\n|trans-title= Germanic word-borrowings in proto-slavic: towards a methodology of their identiification\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=LNthAAAAMAAJ\n| journal               = Croatica, Slavica, Indoeuropaea\n| language              = German\n| publisher             = Verlag der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften\n| publication-date      = 1990\n| volume                = 8\n| issue                 = Erg\u00e4nzungsband\n| pages                  = 59\u201367\n| isbn                  = 9783700117742\n| accessdate            = 2014-01-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Use in Romanticism and the Modern Age ==\n===J. R. R. Tolkien===\n\nSeveral linguists have made use of Gothic as a creative language. The most famous example is ''Bagme Bloma'' (\"Flower of the Trees\") by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], part of ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]''. It was published privately in 1936 for Tolkien and his colleague [[E. V.

When Sherring bought a copy of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' in Salisbury, she found strange inscriptions in it; after she found his name in it, she wrote him a letter and asked him if the inscriptions were his, including the longest one on the back, which was in Gothic. In his reply to her he corrected some of the mistakes in the text; he wrote for example that ''hundai'' should be ''hunda'' and ''\u00feizo boko'' (of those books), which he suggested should be ''\u00feizos bokos'' (of this book). A semantic inaccuracy of the text which he mentioned himself is the use of ''lisan'' for read, while this was ''ussiggwan''. Tolkien also made a [[calque]] of his own name in Gothic in the letter, which according to him should be ''Ruginwaldus Dwalakoneis''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bellet|first1=Bertrand|last2=Babut|first2=Benjamin|title=Apostil to Thucydides|url=http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/thucydide.html|website=Gl\u00e6mscrafu}}</ref>\n\nGothic is also known to have served as the primary inspiration for Tolkien's [[invented language]], [[Taliska]]<ref>J.R.R.

The work may be difficult, dangerous, climatically challenging or underpaid. Workers in sweatshops may work long hours with low pay, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a [[minimum wage]]; [[child labor]] laws may also be violated. The Fair Labor Association's \"2006 Annual Public Report\" inspected factories for FLA compliance in 18 countries including Bangladesh, El Salvador, Colombia, Guatemala, Malaysia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, China, India, Vietnam, Honduras, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2006_annual_public_report.pdf |title=2006 Annual Public Report |publisher=fairlabor.org |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref> The U.S. Department of Labor's \"2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor\" found that \"18 countries did not meet the [[International Labour Organization]]'s recommendation for an adequate number of inspectors.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/2015TDA_1.pdf |title=2015 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor |publisher=dol.gov |accessdate=August 28, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sweatshop in Ludlow Street Tenement, New York cph.3a24271.jpg |thumb|right|A sweatshop in a New York tenement building, c. 1889]]\n\nA sweatshop is a factory or workshop, especially in the [[clothing industry]], where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours under poor conditions and many health risks.\n\nMany workplaces through history have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; but the concept of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the ''sweater'', directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses. Second view of the Western Dress Factory. Emphasis on general conditions in the... - NARA - 518630.jpg|thumb|[[Lewis Hine]] noted poor working conditions when he photographed workers at the Western Dress Factory in [[Millville, New Jersey]], for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s National Research Project (1937)]]\n\nIn 1911, negative public perceptions of sweatshops were galvanized by the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in New York City. The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught \"failing to protect its workers\" in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463|title=Apple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers' |website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/leading-article-the-gruesome-reality-of-sweatshops-2094318.html|title=Leading Article: The Gruesome Reality of Sweatshops |work=Independent.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Workers then go into a state of forced labor, if even one day of work is not accounted for, most are immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past. Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Contemporary use of the term==\n{{main|Nike sweatshops}}\n\n[[File:Lindintracuay.jpg|thumb|right|A modern-day sweatshop]]\nThe phrase sweatshop was coined in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working long hours and in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

Fast fashion refers to \"rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time\" (Ross, 2015)<ref>Ross, R. J. S. (2015). The high toll of fast fashion. Dissent.

To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruptions and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour.

In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian.

Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective.

Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike's image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades.

It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights.<ref name=\"businessinsider.com\">Nisen, M.

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

For example, labour camps in Dubai, UAE do not have proper conditions for the workers and if they protest they can be deported if they are foreigners.<ref>https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/how-did-new-york-university-uphold-workers-rights-during-construction-of-abu-dhabi-satellite-campus</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/10/migrants-united-arab-emirates-human-rights-watch</ref>\n\n===Low education level===\nIt is suggested that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet a lot of them in developing countries are ignorant about their own right because of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily.

Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.\n\n==Sweatshop-free==\n{{Main|Sweatshop-free}}\n[[Sweatshop-free]] is a term the fashion brand [[American Apparel]] created to mean coercion-free, fair-compensation for garment workers who make their products.<ref name=aaworkers>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://www.americanapparel.net/aboutus/verticalint/workers/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610043456/http://www.americanapparel.net/aboutus/verticalint/workers/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 10, 2012 |title=Sweatshop-free.
