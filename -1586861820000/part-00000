The team played its home games at the [[Phillip Ice Skating Centre|Phillip Swimming & Ice Skating Centre]] in [[Phillip, Australian Capital Territory|Phillip]], a suburb of Australia's capital city, [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]]. In February 2014 the team owner announced that operations would fold due to financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance. They were replaced in the league by the [[CBR Brave]]. The Knights were only ever premiers once, in 1998, in the now defunct East Coast Super League, and never made the finals since the formation of the [[Australian Ice Hockey League|AIHL]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1980\u20131993===\nThe [[Phillip Ice Skating Centre|Phillip Ice Skating and Swimming centre]] opened in 1980, and in 1981 the Canberra Knights were formed by a group of former hockey players, many who had not played in years, and they played in various [[exhibition match]]es against international and Australian teams. In 1982 the Knights were a founding member of the New South Wales Superleague, which was a Sydney-based competition, taking on some of the best teams in Australia. In this first year the Knights were coached by Stuart Wright, and although it was unsuccessful for the Canberra Knights, they gained invaluable experience.\n\nIn 1983, the Canberra Knights were again entered into the NSW Superleague.\nChuck Naish and Jim Fuyarchuk, formerly of the [[Macquarie Bears]] and the now \ndefunct [[Warringah Council|Warringah]] Bombers respectively, had been brought in as \nplayer/coaches. This was a big year and the combined talents soon became \nevident as the Canberra Knights proved they were a winning team. Ably \nassisted by some promising young players and the proven skills of the \nimported players, the Canberra Knights finished a close second to the \n[[Warringah Council|Warringah]] Bombers in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://icelegendsaustralia.com/article_2.html | title = Canberra Knights: 1981 - 2014 | publisher=www.icelegendsaustralia.com | first= | last= | date=2014-04-01 | accessdate = 2018-09-11 }}</ref>\n\n1984 continued with the same team line-up, with the addition of two players, Dean Pollock (from the [[Macquarie Bears]]), and Canadian import Bill Rose.\n\n[[Image:Canb Knights 1992 Team photo.jpg|thumb|left|350px|1992 Canberra Knights]]\n\nThe 1992 Knights featured [[Jason Elliott]], a 16-year-old Canadian goalie who migrated to Australia with his parents a year before. Jason, after representing Australia internationally in both senior and junior categories would later return to Canada to play Junior A Tier II hockey with Kimberley of the RMJHL. Jason was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings 205th overall in 1994 directly from the RMJHL, and then went on to star for Cornell\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/96/3.21.96/hockey.html|title=Jason Elliot stars in Cornell win|accessdate=2008-03-03|year=2008}}</ref> in NCAA Division 1 hockey.

The league was reborn in 1994, as the [[East Coast Super League (1994\u20131999)|East Coast Super League]] (ECSL). It continued with the same number of teams but was still largely based in the [[NSW]] area. Canberra's maiden ECSL championship came in 1998 when they won the premiership for the first time ever. The [[East Coast Super League]] has since been reformed as a junior (under 23) competition which serves as a bridge between local league hockey and the national level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecsl.com.au/home.php|title=ECSL Website|accessdate=2007-06-21|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132007===\nThe Canberra Knights, along with the [[Sydney Bears]] and [[Adelaide Avalanche]], founded the [[AIHL]] as a three-team competition following the disbanding of the [[ECSL]] in 2000. 2002 saw the introduction of the [[Melbourne Ice]], the [[Newcastle Northstars]] and the [[West Sydney Ice Dogs]], increasing the number of teams in the league to 6. The team finished just above the [[Melbourne Ice]] in fifth place, ending the season with 12 points and a fourth placed [[goaltender]], Brad Hunt. In 2003 [[David Lewis (ice hockey)|David Lewis]], and import [[Saku Martakainen]] were both top scorers, but the Knights did not perform very well, ending the season in last place, not winning a single game. Since a [[playoff]] format was introduced to the [[AIHL]] in 2003 (prior to this, minor premiers were champions), the Knights have not made the postseason.\n\nIn 2005, with new imports, such as Canadian goaltender [[Dylan Smart]], the Knights were able to enter the 5th [[AIHL]] season stronger than ever, and nearly made the play-offs. With two new teams joining the league, the [[Brisbane Blue Tongues]] and [[Central Coast Rhinos]], the Knights were one of the stronger and more stable teams of the league, winning 11 of 24 games and finishing in fifth place with 35 points.<ref name=\"AIHLstats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaihl.com.au/|title=Official AIHL Website Statistics|accessdate=2007-06-20|year=2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418172352/http://www.theaihl.com.au/|archive-date=18 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Coached by former player Laing Harrow, 2005 has been the strongest Canberra Knights [[AIHL]] season ever.\n\n[[Image:Canberra Knights 2006.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Canberra Knights 2006 team]]In 2006 the Knights acquired Finnish player/coach Tommi Suutari, and they began the season relatively strong, winning a few games, but failed to continue this streak and ended up losing 25 out of 28 regular season games, one of the wins being a miraculous triumph over the [[Sydney Bears]] later in the season, finishing them off in a shoot-out at their home venue in [[Phillip, Australian Capital Territory|Phillip]]. Despite this the Knights still finished in last place. This was also the season where an Australian ice hockey record was set, when Canberra lost 21\u20132 in a game against the [[Newcastle Northstars]].\n\nThe Knights lost head coach Tommi Suutari prior to the commencement of the 2007 season, as he had to return to Finland. [[Mike Harrow]], who also played [[forward (ice hockey)|forward]] for the club, was appointed as [[head coach]]. [[Goaltender]]s were also changed, as [[Luke Fiveash]] became the Canberra Knights primary goalie, with Brad Hunt as a secondary. This season also saw the addition of [[Finland|Finnish]] imports [[Ari-Pekka Hakala]], who went on to become the second highest scorer for the season, and [[Antti Teisala]]. During previous seasons the Knights were notorious for having very outdated and old away jerseys, but half way through the season there was a redesign, with the introduction of their current away jerseys.\n\nThe team won their opening game of the 2007 season against the [[Brisbane Blue Tongues]], but did not follow up their performance, losing the next 3 games. On Saturday 5 May the Knights had a compelling 5\u20133 win against a strong West Sydney side. Since this win, the Knights only won four more games, including 9 June against the [[Central Coast Rhinos]], defeating them 7\u20130. 2007 saw the Knights only winning two away games, including their last match of the season, against the [[Brisbane Blue Tongues]], which eliminated them from the playoffs. The season also saw the exit of two veteran Knights players, long time goalie Brad Hunt, and [[Mike Harrow]] who served the team for many years in various roles, as coach and captain. The Canberra Knights finished the 2007 season on 20 points, in seventh place.\n\n===2008-2014===\nWith the loss of Brad Hunt and [[Mike Harrow]], the 2008 season will open the doors to new imports and junior players moving up to the [[AIHL]]. With goal tender Nick Eckhardt will getting more ice time with the team, and the likely return of [[Finland|Finnish]] imports [[Ari-Pekka Hakala|Hakala]] and [[Antti Teisala|Teisala]], the Canberra Knights are set to be a strong team in the 2008 [[AIHL]] season. On 26 February 2014 club owner John Raut announced that the team have folded operations effective immediately and would not be competing in the upcoming [[2014 AIHL season]]. Raut cited financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance as the reasons behind the move.<ref name=\"FOLDEDCANBERRATIMES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/canberra-knights-on-thin-ice-after-33-years-in-existence-20140226-33i61.html |title=Canberra Knights on thin ice after 33 years in existence |publisher=The Canberra Times |first=Lee |last=Gaskin |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-02-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417115240/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/canberra-knights-on-thin-ice-after-33-years-in-existence-20140226-33i61.html |archivedate=17 April 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"FOLDEDHEWITT\">{{cite web|url=http://hewittsports.com/knights-fall-sword/ |title=Knights Fall On Their Sword |publisher=Hewitt Sports Network |first=Chris |last=Meister |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-02-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227020128/http://hewittsports.com/knights-fall-sword/ |archivedate=27 February 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The following day it was announced that the player group headed by captain Mark Rummukainen have approached the AIHL with plans on taking on the club's licence.<ref name=\"PLAYERSMOVETOKEEPALIVE\">{{cite web|url=http://m.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-knights-not-dead-and-buried-yet-20140227-33jvq.html |title=Canberra Knights not dead and buried yet |publisher=The Canberra Times |first=Lee |last=Gaskin |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304050056/http://m.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-knights-not-dead-and-buried-yet-20140227-33jvq.html |archivedate=4 March 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The following month the league announced that the Knights had been replaced in the league by the [[CBR Brave]].<ref name=\"CBRBRAVEANNOUNCED\">{{cite web | url=http://www.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletterarchive.cfm?clientid=3856&leagueid=11464&page=78382 | title=CBR Brave Granted Provisional License | publisher=Australian Ice Hockey League | first=Andrew | last=McMurty | date=2014-03-05 | accessdate=2014-03-06 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315201353/http://www.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletterarchive.cfm?clientid=3856&leagueid=11464&page=78382 | archivedate=15 March 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Knights owner, John Raut, will keep possession of the Knights brand and has suggested reviving the team in the future to play in the [[East Coast Super League]].<ref name=\"BRANDRETAINEDBYOWNER\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-ice-hockey-knights-close-to-making-a-return-20140302-33u94.html |title=Canberra ice hockey Knights close to making a return |publisher=The Canberra Times |first=Lee |last=Gaskin |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610162300/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-ice-hockey-knights-close-to-making-a-return-20140302-33u94.html |archivedate=10 June 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Championships==\n\n*'''East Coast Superleague'''\n:'''Champions (1):''' 1998\n\n*'''NSW Superleague'''\n:'''Champions (0):''' \n: Runners-Up (1): 1983\n\n==Team Colours==\n[[Image:CanberraKnightsLogo.jpg|thumb|right|Canberra Knights Alternative Logo found on away jerseys]]\n\n===Logo===\nThe Canberra Knights logo shows a teal-coloured Knight wielding a hockey stick.

The team played its home games at the [[Phillip Ice Skating Centre|Phillip Swimming & Ice Skating Centre]] in [[Phillip, Australian Capital Territory|Phillip]], a suburb of Australia's capital city, [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]]. In February 2014 the team owner announced that operations would fold due to financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance. They were replaced in the league by the [[CBR Brave]]. The Knights were only ever premiers once, in 1998, in the now defunct East Coast Super League, and never made the finals since the formation of the [[Australian Ice Hockey League|AIHL]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1980\u20131993===\nThe [[Phillip Ice Skating Centre|Phillip Ice Skating and Swimming centre]] opened in 1980, and in 1981 the Canberra Knights were formed by a group of former hockey players, many who had not played in years, and they played in various [[exhibition match]]es against international and Australian teams. In 1982 the Knights were a founding member of the New South Wales Superleague, which was a Sydney-based competition, taking on some of the best teams in Australia. In this first year the Knights were coached by Stuart Wright, and although it was unsuccessful for the Canberra Knights, they gained invaluable experience.\n\nIn 1983, the Canberra Knights were again entered into the NSW Superleague.\nChuck Naish and Jim Fuyarchuk, formerly of the [[Macquarie Bears]] and the now \ndefunct [[Warringah Council|Warringah]] Bombers respectively, had been brought in as \nplayer/coaches. This was a big year and the combined talents soon became \nevident as the Canberra Knights proved they were a winning team. Ably \nassisted by some promising young players and the proven skills of the \nimported players, the Canberra Knights finished a close second to the \n[[Warringah Council|Warringah]] Bombers in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://icelegendsaustralia.com/article_2.html | title = Canberra Knights: 1981 - 2014 | publisher=www.icelegendsaustralia.com | first= | last= | date=2014-04-01 | accessdate = 2018-09-11 }}</ref>\n\n1984 continued with the same team line-up, with the addition of two players, Dean Pollock (from the [[Macquarie Bears]]), and Canadian import Bill Rose.\n\n[[Image:Canb Knights 1992 Team photo.jpg|thumb|left|350px|1992 Canberra Knights]]\n\nThe 1992 Knights featured [[Jason Elliott]], a 16-year-old Canadian goalie who migrated to Australia with his parents a year before. Jason, after representing Australia internationally in both senior and junior categories would later return to Canada to play Junior A Tier II hockey with Kimberley of the RMJHL. Jason was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings 205th overall in 1994 directly from the RMJHL, and then went on to star for Cornell\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/96/3.21.96/hockey.html|title=Jason Elliot stars in Cornell win|accessdate=2008-03-03|year=2008}}</ref> in NCAA Division 1 hockey.

The league was reborn in 1994, as the [[East Coast Super League (1994\u20131999)|East Coast Super League]] (ECSL). It continued with the same number of teams but was still largely based in the [[NSW]] area. Canberra's maiden ECSL championship came in 1998 when they won the premiership for the first time ever. The [[East Coast Super League]] has since been reformed as a junior (under 23) competition which serves as a bridge between local league hockey and the national level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecsl.com.au/home.php|title=ECSL Website|accessdate=2007-06-21|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132007===\nThe Canberra Knights, along with the [[Sydney Bears]] and [[Adelaide Avalanche]], founded the [[AIHL]] as a three-team competition following the disbanding of the [[ECSL]] in 2000. 2002 saw the introduction of the [[Melbourne Ice]], the [[Newcastle Northstars]] and the [[West Sydney Ice Dogs]], increasing the number of teams in the league to 6. The team finished just above the [[Melbourne Ice]] in fifth place, ending the season with 12 points and a fourth placed [[goaltender]], Brad Hunt. In 2003 [[David Lewis (ice hockey)|David Lewis]], and import [[Saku Martakainen]] were both top scorers, but the Knights did not perform very well, ending the season in last place, not winning a single game. Since a [[playoff]] format was introduced to the [[AIHL]] in 2003 (prior to this, minor premiers were champions), the Knights have not made the postseason.\n\nIn 2005, with new imports, such as Canadian goaltender [[Dylan Smart]], the Knights were able to enter the 5th [[AIHL]] season stronger than ever, and nearly made the play-offs. With two new teams joining the league, the [[Brisbane Blue Tongues]] and [[Central Coast Rhinos]], the Knights were one of the stronger and more stable teams of the league, winning 11 of 24 games and finishing in fifth place with 35 points.<ref name=\"AIHLstats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaihl.com.au/|title=Official AIHL Website Statistics|accessdate=2007-06-20|year=2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418172352/http://www.theaihl.com.au/|archive-date=18 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Coached by former player Laing Harrow, 2005 has been the strongest Canberra Knights [[AIHL]] season ever.\n\n[[Image:Canberra Knights 2006.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Canberra Knights 2006 team]]In 2006 the Knights acquired Finnish player/coach Tommi Suutari, and they began the season relatively strong, winning a few games, but failed to continue this streak and ended up losing 25 out of 28 regular season games, one of the wins being a miraculous triumph over the [[Sydney Bears]] later in the season, finishing them off in a shoot-out at their home venue in [[Phillip, Australian Capital Territory|Phillip]]. Despite this the Knights still finished in last place. This was also the season where an Australian ice hockey record was set, when Canberra lost 21\u20132 in a game against the [[Newcastle Northstars]].\n\nThe Knights lost head coach Tommi Suutari prior to the commencement of the 2007 season, as he had to return to Finland. [[Mike Harrow]], who also played [[forward (ice hockey)|forward]] for the club, was appointed as [[head coach]]. [[Goaltender]]s were also changed, as [[Luke Fiveash]] became the Canberra Knights primary goalie, with Brad Hunt as a secondary. This season also saw the addition of [[Finland|Finnish]] imports [[Ari-Pekka Hakala]], who went on to become the second highest scorer for the season, and [[Antti Teisala]]. During previous seasons the Knights were notorious for having very outdated and old away jerseys, but half way through the season there was a redesign, with the introduction of their current away jerseys.\n\nThe team won their opening game of the 2007 season against the [[Brisbane Blue Tongues]], but did not follow up their performance, losing the next 3 games. On Saturday 5 May the Knights had a compelling 5\u20133 win against a strong West Sydney side. Since this win, the Knights only won four more games, including 9 June against the [[Central Coast Rhinos]], defeating them 7\u20130. 2007 saw the Knights only winning two away games, including their last match of the season, against the [[Brisbane Blue Tongues]], which eliminated them from the playoffs. The season also saw the exit of two veteran Knights players, long time goalie Brad Hunt, and [[Mike Harrow]] who served the team for many years in various roles, as coach and captain. The Canberra Knights finished the 2007 season on 20 points, in seventh place.\n\n===2008-2014===\nWith the loss of Brad Hunt and [[Mike Harrow]], the 2008 season will open the doors to new imports and junior players moving up to the [[AIHL]]. With goal tender Nick Eckhardt will getting more ice time with the team, and the likely return of [[Finland|Finnish]] imports [[Ari-Pekka Hakala|Hakala]] and [[Antti Teisala|Teisala]], the Canberra Knights are set to be a strong team in the 2008 [[AIHL]] season. On 26 February 2014 club owner John Raut announced that the team have folded operations effective immediately and would not be competing in the upcoming [[2014 AIHL season]]. Raut cited financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance as the reasons behind the move.<ref name=\"FOLDEDCANBERRATIMES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/canberra-knights-on-thin-ice-after-33-years-in-existence-20140226-33i61.html |title=Canberra Knights on thin ice after 33 years in existence |publisher=The Canberra Times |first=Lee |last=Gaskin |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-02-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417115240/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/act-sport/canberra-knights-on-thin-ice-after-33-years-in-existence-20140226-33i61.html |archivedate=17 April 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"FOLDEDHEWITT\">{{cite web|url=http://hewittsports.com/knights-fall-sword/ |title=Knights Fall On Their Sword |publisher=Hewitt Sports Network |first=Chris |last=Meister |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-02-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227020128/http://hewittsports.com/knights-fall-sword/ |archivedate=27 February 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The following day it was announced that the player group headed by captain Mark Rummukainen have approached the AIHL with plans on taking on the club's licence.<ref name=\"PLAYERSMOVETOKEEPALIVE\">{{cite web|url=http://m.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-knights-not-dead-and-buried-yet-20140227-33jvq.html |title=Canberra Knights not dead and buried yet |publisher=The Canberra Times |first=Lee |last=Gaskin |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304050056/http://m.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-knights-not-dead-and-buried-yet-20140227-33jvq.html |archivedate=4 March 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The following month the league announced that the Knights had been replaced in the league by the [[CBR Brave]].<ref name=\"CBRBRAVEANNOUNCED\">{{cite web | url=http://www.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletterarchive.cfm?clientid=3856&leagueid=11464&page=78382 | title=CBR Brave Granted Provisional License | publisher=Australian Ice Hockey League | first=Andrew | last=McMurty | date=2014-03-05 | accessdate=2014-03-06 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315201353/http://www.theaihl.com/leagues/newsletterarchive.cfm?clientid=3856&leagueid=11464&page=78382 | archivedate=15 March 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Knights owner, John Raut, will keep possession of the Knights brand and has suggested reviving the team in the future to play in the [[East Coast Super League]].<ref name=\"BRANDRETAINEDBYOWNER\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-ice-hockey-knights-close-to-making-a-return-20140302-33u94.html |title=Canberra ice hockey Knights close to making a return |publisher=The Canberra Times |first=Lee |last=Gaskin |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610162300/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/canberra-ice-hockey-knights-close-to-making-a-return-20140302-33u94.html |archivedate=10 June 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Championships==\n\n*'''East Coast Superleague'''\n:'''Champions (1):''' 1998\n\n*'''NSW Superleague'''\n:'''Champions (0):''' \n: Runners-Up (1): 1983\n\n==Team Colours==\n[[Image:CanberraKnightsLogo.jpg|thumb|right|Canberra Knights Alternative Logo found on away jerseys]]\n\n===Logo===\nThe Canberra Knights logo shows a teal-coloured Knight wielding a hockey stick.
