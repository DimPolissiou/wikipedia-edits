The term \"Pointillism\" was coined by [[art critics]] in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, but is now used without its earlier mocking connotation.<ref name=artcyclopedia /> The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as [[Neo-impressionism]]. The [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] used a similar technique of patterns to form shapes, though with larger sphere-like brushstrokes.<ref>Ruhrberg, Karl. \"Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists\". ''Art of the 20th Century'', Vol. 2. Koln: Benedikt Taschen Verlag, 1998. {{ISBN|3-8228-4089-0}}.</ref>\n\n== Technique ==\nThe technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to [[Divisionism]], a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.<ref name=artcyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html|title=Pointillism|website=www.artcyclopedia.com}}</ref> It is a technique with few serious practitioners today and is notably seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], [[Paul Signac|Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross|Cross]]. However, see also [[Andy Warhol]]'s early works and [[Pop Art]].\n\n[[File:Paul Signac Femmes au puits 1892d\u00e9tailcouleur.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Signac]], ''Femmes au Puits'', 1892, showing a detail with constituent colors.

Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York</ref> This form of Divisionism was a significant step beyond the preoccupations of Signac and Cross. In 1906, the art critic Louis Chassevent recognized the difference and, as art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] pointed out, used the word \"cube\" which would later be taken up by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: \n:\"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]\".<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\">Robert L.

Pointillism is analogous to the four-color [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of [[cyan]], [[magenta]], yellow and key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using [[RGB color model|Red, Green, and Blue]] (RGB) colors.<ref name=\"Greene\">Vivien Greene, ''Divisionism, Neo-Impressionism: Arcadia & Anarchy'', Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|0-89207-357-8}}</ref>\n\nIf red, blue, and green light (the [[Primary color#Additive primaries|additive primaries]]) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see [[Prism (optics)]]). Painting is inherently [[Primary color#Additive primaries|subtractive]], but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots.<ref name=\"Greene\" />\n\nThe painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate [[Texture (painting)|texture]].<ref name=\"Greene\" />\n\nThe majority of Pointillism is done in oil paint. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/chico/emerson/pntmat.html|title=Nathan, Solon. \"Pointillism Materials.\" Web. 9 Feb 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019090200/http://www.si.umich.edu/chico/emerson/pntmat.html|archivedate=2009-10-19}}</ref>\n\n== Common uses of Pointillism ==\nPointill\u00e9 is commonly used for intricate binding of hand-made book covers in the seventeenth century, the decoration of metallic arms and armor, and for the decoration of hand-finished firearms.\n\n== Music ==\n\nPointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition.

The term \"Pointillism\" was coined by [[art critics]] in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, but is now used without its earlier mocking connotation.<ref name=artcyclopedia /> The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as [[Neo-impressionism]]. The [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.<ref>Ruhrberg, Karl. \"Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists\". ''Art of the 20th Century'', Vol. 2. Koln: Benedikt Taschen Verlag, 1998. {{ISBN|3-8228-4089-0}}.</ref>\n\n== Technique ==\nThe technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to [[Divisionism]], a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint.<ref name=artcyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/pointillism.html|title=Pointillism|website=www.artcyclopedia.com}}</ref> It is a technique with few serious practitioners today and is notably seen in the works of [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], [[Paul Signac|Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross|Cross]].

It borders with France ([[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] and [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]), Switzerland ([[Ticino]] and [[Valais]]) and the Italian regions of [[Lombardy]], [[Liguria]], [[Aosta Valley]] and for a very small part with [[Emilia Romagna]].\nThe geography of Piedmont is 43.3% mountainous, along with extensive areas of hills (30.3%) and plains (26.4%).\n\nPiedmont is the second largest of [[Italy]]'s 20 regions, after [[Sicily]]. It is broadly coincident with the upper part of the [[drainage basin]] of the river [[Po River|Po]], which rises from the slopes of Monviso in the west of the region and is Italy's largest river. The Po drains the semicircle formed by the [[Alps]] and [[Apennines]], which surround the region on three sides.\n\nFrom the highest peaks, the land slopes down to hilly areas, (sometimes with a brusque transition from mountain to plain) and then to the [[Padan Plain]]. The boundary between the two is characterised by resurgent springs\u2014typical of the Padan Plain\u2014which supply fresh water to the rivers and a dense network of irrigation canals.\n\nThe countryside is very diverse: from the rugged peaks of the massifs of Monte Rosa and Gran Paradiso to the damp rice paddies of Vercelli and Novara, from the gentle hillsides of the [[Langhe]], [[Roero]] and [[Montferrat]] to the plains. 7.6% of the entire territory is considered [[protected area]]. There are 56 different national or regional parks; one of the most famous is the [[Gran Paradiso National Park]], between Piedmont and the [[Aosta Valley]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Kingdom of Sardinia}}\n[[File:Exterior of the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi]], in [[Nichelino]], is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]].]]\n[[File:La Sacra ammantata dalla neve.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Sacra di San Michele]] symbol of Piedmont]]\n\nPiedmont was inhabited in early historic times by [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes such as the [[Taurini]] and the [[Salassi]]. They were later subdued by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] (c. 220 BC), who founded several colonies there including ''Augusta Taurinorum ''(Turin) and ''Eporedia'' ([[Ivrea]]). After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the region was successively invaded by the [[Burgundians]], the [[Ostrogoths]] (5th century), [[Byzantine Empire|East Romans]], [[Lombards]] (6th century), and [[Franks]] (773).\n\nIn the 9th\u201310th centuries there were further incursions by the [[Magyars]], [[Saracens]] and Muslim [[Moors]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=The Ism\u0101\u02bb\u0131\u0304l\u0131\u0304s: Their History and Doctrines |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/ismlstheirhistor0000daft|url-access=registration |isbn=0-521-37019-1 }}</ref> At the time Piedmont, as part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was subdivided into several marches and counties.\n\n[[File:SardiniePiemont.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1856.]]\n\nIn 1046, [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Oddo of Savoy]] added Piedmont to their main territory of [[County of Savoy|Savoy]], with a capital at [[Chamb\u00e9ry]] (now in France). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (municipalities) of [[Asti]] and [[Alessandria]] and the marquisates of [[Marquisate of Saluzzo|Saluzzo]] and [[Marquisate of Montferrat|Montferrat]]. The County of Savoy was elevated to a duchy in 1416, and Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert|Emanuele Filiberto]] moved the seat to Turin in 1563. In 1720, the Duke of Savoy became King of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], founding what evolved into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and increasing Turin's importance as a European capital.\n\nThe [[Republic of Alba]] was created in 1796 as a [[French client republic]] in Piedmont. A new client republic, the [[Piedmontese Republic]], existed between 1798 and 1799 before it was reoccupied by Austrian and Russian troops. In June 1800 a third client republic, the [[Subalpine Republic]], was established in Piedmont. It fell under full French control in 1801 and it was annexed by France in September 1802. In the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored, and furthermore received the [[Republic of Genoa]] to strengthen it as a barrier against France.\n\nPiedmont was a springboard for [[Italian unification|Italy's unification]] in 1859\u20131861, following earlier unsuccessful wars against the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1820\u20131821<ref>http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=mnn</ref> and 1848\u20131849.

The main agricultural products in Piedmont are [[cereals]], including [[rice]], representing more than 10% of national production, [[maize]], [[grape]]s for [[wine]]-making, [[fruit]] and [[milk]].<ref name=\"europa1\">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=23 April 2010 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210184406/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_eco.htm |archivedate=10 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> With more than 800,000 head of cattle in 2000, livestock production accounts for half of final agricultural production in Piedmont.\n\nPiedmont is one of the great winegrowing regions in Italy. More than half of its {{convert|700|km2|acre}} of vineyards are registered with [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]] designations. It produces prestigious wines as [[Barolo]], [[Barbaresco]], from the [[Langhe]] near [[Alba (CN)|Alba]], and the [[Moscato d'Asti]] as well as the sparkling [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] from the vineyards around [[Asti]]. Indigenous grape varieties include [[Nebbiolo]], [[Barbera]], [[Dolcetto]], [[Freisa]], [[Grignolino]] and [[Brachetto]].\n\nThe region contains major industrial centres, the main of which is [[Turin]], home to the [[FIAT]] automobile works. [[Olivetti]], once a major electronics industry whose plants were in [[Scarmagno]], and [[Ivrea]], has now turned into a small-scale computer service company. [[Biella]] produces tissues and silks. The city of [[Asti]] is located about 55 kilometres (34 miles) east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and is one of the most important centres of [[Montferrat]], one of the best known Italian wine districts in the world, declared officially on 22 June 2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1390|title=Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre}}</ref>\n\n[[Alba (CN)|Alba]] is the home of [[Ferrero SpA|Ferrero]]'s chocolate factories and some mechanical industries. There are links with neighbouring France via the [[Fr\u00e9jus Road Tunnel|Fr\u00e9jus]] and the [[Colle di Tenda]] tunnels as well as the Montgen\u00e8vre Pass. Piedmont also connects with [[Switzerland]] with the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]] and [[Great St Bernard]] passes. It is possible to reach Switzerland via a normal road that crosses Oriental Piedmont starting from [[Arona (NO)|Arona]] and ending in [[Locarno]], on the border with Italy. The region's airport, [[Turin International Airport|Turin-Caselle]], caters domestic and international flights.<ref name=\"europa1\"/>\nThe region has the longest motorway network amongst the Italian regions (about 800&nbsp;km). It radiates from [[Turin]], connecting it with the other provinces in the region, as well as with the other regions in Italy. In 2001, the number of passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants was 623 (above the national average of 575).<ref name=\"europa1\"/>\n\n[[File:LingottoPalazzina4.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Lingotto]] building in Turin, the world headquarters of [[Fiat]].]]\n\nTourism in Piedmont employs 75,534 people and currently comprises 17,367 companies operating in the hospitality and catering sector, with 1,473 hotels and tourist accommodations. The sector generates a turnover of \u20ac2,671 million, 3.3% of the \u20ac80,196 million, which represents the total estimated spending on tourism in Italy. The region enjoys almost the same level of popularity among Italians and visitors from oversea. In 2002 there were 2,651,068 total arrivals. International visitors to Piedmont in 2002 accounted for 42% of the total number of tourists with 1,124,696 arrivals. The traditional leading areas for tourism in Piedmont are the Lake District \u2013 \"Piedmont's riviera\", which accounts for 32.84% of total overnight stays, and the metropolitan area of Turin, which accounts for 26.51%.<ref>[http://www.regione.piemonte.it/lingue/english/pagine/cultura/approfondimenti/02_piemontur_en.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326094510/http://www.regione.piemonte.it/lingue/english/pagine/cultura/approfondimenti/02_piemontur_en.pdf|date=26 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Turin hosted the [[XX Olympic Winter Games]] and in 2007 it hosted the [[2007 Winter Universiade|XXIII Universiade]]. Alpine tourism tends to concentrate in a few highly developed stations like [[Alagna Valsesia]] and [[Sestriere]]. Around 1980, the long-distance trail [[Grande Traversata delle Alpi]] (GTA) was created to draw more attention to the manyfold of remote, sparsely inhabited valleys.\n\nSince 2006, the Piedmont region has benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that highlighted the rich agricultural and [[viticulture|viticultural]] value of the Po valley and northern Italy. In the same year, [[Piemonte Agency for Investments, Export and Tourism]] strives to strengthen the international role of the area and its potential. It was the first Italian institution to bring together all activities carried out by pre-existing local organizations operating for the internationalization of the territory.\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 137.4 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.8% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 31,300 euros or 104% of the EU27 average in the same year.

This drop is the result of the natural negative balance (of some 3 to 4% per year), while the migratory balance since 1986 has again become positive because of an excess of new immigration over a stable figure for emigration.<ref name=\"Eurostat\"/>\nThe population as a whole has remained stable in the 1990s, although this is the result of a negative natural balance and a positive net migration.\n\nThe Turin metro area grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s due to an increase of immigrants from southern Italy and Veneto and today it has a population of approximately two million. {{As of|2008}}, the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 310,543 foreign-born immigrants live in Piedmont, equal to 7.0% of the total regional population. Most immigrants come from Eastern Europe (mostly from Romania, Albania, and Ukraine) with smaller communities of African immigrants.\n\n== Government and politics ==\n{{main|Politics of Piedmont}}\n\nThe Regional Government (''Giunta Regionale'') is presided by the President of the Region (''Presidente della Regione''), who is elected for a five-year term and is composed by the President and the Ministers, who are currently 14, including a Vice President (''Vice Presidente'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.piemonte.it/governo/assessorati/index.htm |title=Sito Ufficiale della Regione Piemonte: Giunta regionale |publisher=Regione.piemonte.it |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>\nIn the last regional election, which took place on 29\u201330 March 2010, [[Roberto Cota]] ([[Lega Nord]]) defeated incumbent [[Mercedes Bresso]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]).

It borders with France ([[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] and [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]), Switzerland ([[Ticino]] and [[Valais]]) and the Italian regions of [[Lombardy]], [[Liguria]], [[Aosta Valley]] and for a very small part with [[Emilia Romagna]].\nThe geography of Piedmont is 43.3% mountainous, along with extensive areas of hills (30.3%) and plains (26.4%).\n\nPiedmont is the second largest of [[Italy]]'s 20 regions, after [[Sicily]]. It is broadly coincident with the upper part of the [[drainage basin]] of the river [[Po River|Po]], which rises from the slopes of Monviso in the west of the region and is Italy's largest river. The Po drains the semicircle formed by the [[Alps]] and [[Apennines]], which surround the region on three sides.\n\nFrom the highest peaks, the land slopes down to hilly areas, (sometimes with a brusque transition from mountain to plain) and then to the [[Padan Plain]]. The boundary between the two is characterised by resurgent springs\u2014typical of the Padan Plain\u2014which supply fresh water to the rivers and a dense network of irrigation canals.\n\nThe countryside is very diverse: from the rugged peaks of the massifs of Monte Rosa and Gran Paradiso to the damp rice paddies of Vercelli and Novara, from the gentle hillsides of the [[Langhe]], [[Roero]] and [[Montferrat]] to the plains. 7.6% of the entire territory is considered [[protected area]]. There are 56 different national or regional parks; one of the most famous is the [[Gran Paradiso National Park]], between Piedmont and the [[Aosta Valley]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Kingdom of Sardinia}}\n[[File:Exterior of the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi]], in [[Nichelino]], is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]].]]\n[[File:La Sacra ammantata dalla neve.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Sacra di San Michele]] symbol of Piedmont]]\n\nPiedmont was inhabited in early historic times by [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes such as the [[Taurini]] and the [[Salassi]]. They were later subdued by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] (c. 220 BC), who founded several colonies there including ''Augusta Taurinorum ''(Turin) and ''Eporedia'' ([[Ivrea]]). After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the region was successively invaded by the [[Burgundians]], the [[Ostrogoths]] (5th century), [[Byzantine Empire|East Romans]], [[Lombards]] (6th century), and [[Franks]] (773).\n\nIn the 9th\u201310th centuries there were further incursions by the [[Magyars]], [[Saracens]] and Muslim [[Moors]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=The Ism\u0101\u02bb\u0131\u0304l\u0131\u0304s: Their History and Doctrines |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/ismlstheirhistor0000daft|url-access=registration |isbn=0-521-37019-1 }}</ref> At the time Piedmont, as part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was subdivided into several marches and counties.\n\n[[File:SardiniePiemont.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1856.]]\n\nIn 1046, [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Oddo of Savoy]] added Piedmont to their main territory of [[County of Savoy|Savoy]], with a capital at [[Chamb\u00e9ry]] (now in France). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (municipalities) of [[Asti]] and [[Alessandria]] and the marquisates of [[Marquisate of Saluzzo|Saluzzo]] and [[Marquisate of Montferrat|Montferrat]]. The County of Savoy was elevated to a duchy in 1416, and Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert|Emanuele Filiberto]] moved the seat to Turin in 1563. In 1720, the Duke of Savoy became King of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], founding what evolved into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and increasing Turin's importance as a European capital.\n\nThe [[Republic of Alba]] was created in 1796 as a [[French client republic]] in Piedmont. A new client republic, the [[Piedmontese Republic]], existed between 1798 and 1799 before it was reoccupied by Austrian and Russian troops. In June 1800 a third client republic, the [[Subalpine Republic]], was established in Piedmont. It fell under full French control in 1801 and it was annexed by France in September 1802. In the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored, and furthermore received the [[Republic of Genoa]] to strengthen it as a barrier against France.\n\nPiedmont was a springboard for [[Italian unification|Italy's unification]] in 1859\u20131861, following earlier unsuccessful wars against the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1820\u20131821<ref>http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=mnn</ref> and 1848\u20131849.

More than half of its {{convert|700|km2|acre}} of vineyards are registered with [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]] designations. It produces prestigious wines as [[Barolo]], [[Barbaresco]], from the [[Langhe]] near [[Alba (CN)|Alba]], and the [[Moscato d'Asti]] as well as the sparkling [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] from the vineyards around [[Asti]]. Indigenous grape varieties include [[Nebbiolo]], [[Barbera]], [[Dolcetto]], [[Freisa]], [[Grignolino]] and [[Brachetto]].\n\nThe region contains major industrial centres, the main of which is [[Turin]], home to the [[FIAT]] automobile works. [[Olivetti]], once a major electronics industry whose plant was in [[Scarmagno]], near [[Ivrea]], has now turned into a small-scale computer service company. [[Biella]] produces tissues and silks. The city of [[Asti]] is located about 55 kilometres (34 miles) east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and is one of the most important centres of [[Montferrat]], one of the best known Italian wine districts in the world, declared officially on 22 June 2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1390|title=Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre}}</ref>\n\n[[Alba (CN)|Alba]] is the home of [[Ferrero SpA|Ferrero]]'s chocolate factories and some mechanical industries.

Piedmont also connects with [[Switzerland]] with the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]] and [[Great St Bernard]] passes. It is possible to reach Switzerland via a normal road that crosses Oriental Piedmont starting from [[Arona (NO)|Arona]] and ending in [[Locarno]], on the border with Italy.

The sector generates a turnover of \u20ac2,671 million, 3.3% of the \u20ac80,196 million, which represents the total estimated spending on tourism in Italy. The region enjoys almost the same level of popularity among Italians and visitors from oversea. In 2002 there were 2,651,068 total arrivals. International visitors to Piedmont in 2002 accounted for 42% of the total number of tourists with 1,124,696 arrivals.

Around 1980, the long-distance trail [[Grande Traversata delle Alpi]] (GTA) was created to draw more attention to the manyfold of remote, sparsely inhabited valleys.\n\nSince 2006, the Piedmont region has benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that highlighted the rich agricultural and [[viticulture|viticultural]] value of the Po valley and northern Italy.

This drop is the result of the natural negative balance (of some 3 to 4% per year), while the migratory balance since 1986 has again become positive because of an excess of new immigration over a stable figure for emigration.<ref name=\"Eurostat\"/>\nThe population as a whole has remained stable in the 1990s, although this is the result of a negative natural balance and a positive net migration.\n\nThe Turin metro area grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s due to an increase of immigrants from southern Italy and Veneto and today it has a population of approximately two million. {{As of|2008}}, the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 310,543 foreign-born immigrants live in Piedmont, equal to 7.0% of the total regional population.

Academic dress is also worn by members of certain [[learned societies]] and institutions as official dress.<ref>e.g. [http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/robes.php Burgon Society: Robes]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facs.org/archives/congresshighlight.html |title=History and Archives of the American College of Surgeons; Highlight of the Month October 10, 2005; The Clinical Congress: Then and Now, accessed 01/29/2008 |publisher=Facs.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519122103/http://facs.org/archives/congresshighlight.html |archivedate=19 May 2011  }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe academic dress found in most universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States]] is derived from that of the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which was a development of academic and clerical dress common throughout the [[medieval university|medieval universities]] of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phildress.co.uk/london/origins.html |title=Goff, pp. 13\u201314 |publisher=Phildress.co.uk |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515070306/http://www.phildress.co.uk/london/origins.html |archivedate=15 May 2011  }}</ref> <!--, itself a development of the academic robes worn in the medieval [[Madrasah]]s of the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Christian-Muslim Relations|first=Hugh|last=Goddard|year=2000|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=074861009X|page=100|isbn status=May be invalid \u2013 please double check|postscript=None}}-->\n\nFormal or sober clothing is typically worn beneath the gown so, for example, men would often wear a dark [[suit (clothes)|suit]] with a white [[shirt]] and a [[Necktie|tie]], or [[clerical clothing]], [[military uniform|military]] or civil [[uniform]], or [[national dress]], and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as ''[[subfusc]]'') to be worn under the gown. Although some universities are relaxed about what people wear under their gowns, it is nevertheless considered bad form to be in [[casual wear]] or the like during graduation ceremonies, and a number of universities may bar finishing students from joining the procession or the ceremony itself if not appropriately dressed<ref>{{cite web|author=n.wood@sheffield.ac.uk |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/eventsteam/wear.html |title=University of Sheffield: What should I wear? |publisher=Shef.ac.uk |accessdate=28 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405090210/http://www.shef.ac.uk/eventsteam/wear.html| archivedate= 5 April 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> (though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress and not what is worn beneath it, if unseen). In the Commonwealth, gowns are worn open, while in the United States, with the exception of the academic dress of the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], it has become common for gowns to close at the front, as did the original ''roba''.\n\n==Materials==\nIn general, the materials used for academic dress are heavily influenced by the climate where the academic institution is located, or the climate where the graduate will usually be wearing the costume (as a faculty member at another institution, for example). In either case, the American Council of Education (ACE) allows for the comfort of the wearer, and concedes that lighter materials be used in tropical climates, and heavier materials elsewhere.<ref>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Gowns, ''Material''</ref> In addition, it acknowledges cotton poplin, broadcloth, rayon, or silk as appropriate.<ref>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Caps, ''Material''</ref>\n\nThe materials used for academic dress vary and range from the extremely economical to the very expensive. In the United States, most Bachelor and master's degree candidates are often only presented the \"[[souvenir]]\" version of regalia by their institutions or authorized vendor, which are generally intended for very few wearings and are comparatively very inexpensive. For some doctoral graduates, commencement will be the only time they wear academic regalia, and so they rent their gowns instead of buying them. These rented (or hired)<ref>American English uses 'rented', British English uses 'hired'.</ref> gowns are often made of inexpensive [[polyester]] or other man-made synthetic fibre. In Britain, rented gowns are almost always polyester while [[Russell cord]], silk, or artificial silk gowns are only available when bought. Undergraduate gowns are usually made from cotton or cotton and polyester mix and are relatively inexpensive to encourage students to own them.\n\nPeople who choose to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as [[poplin]], [[grosgrain]], [[percale]], [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[cassimere]], [[broadcloth]], Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types including [[artificial silk]]/[[rayon]], [[Ottoman (textile)|Ottoman]] (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), [[taffeta]], [[satin]], [[alpaca]], true [[silk]], [[shot silk]], or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive.<ref>An [[Ede & Ravenscroft]] [[Oxford MA]] hood made of pure Ottoman silk will cost around \u00a3347. Source: http://www.gownhire.co.uk (21 September 2007)</ref> Some gowns may be trimmed with [[gimp (thread)#In lace|gimp lace]], cords, buttons, or other forms of decoration.\n\nIn the past, [[fur]] has been used to line certain hoods (especially those of the UK) which range from [[rabbit fur|rabbit]] to [[ermine]]. In the past, [[sheepskin]] was widely used. Most now use imitation fur, instead, mainly because of cost and [[animal rights]] concerns. Some robe makers use fur if the customer requests and pays for it, as some feel that the quality and feel of artificial fur has yet to match that of real fur.<ref>The cost difference between artificial and real fur can be as much as a few hundred pounds.</ref>\n\nDoctor's robes usually use wool [[flannel]], [[panama (wool)|panama]] (worsted), superfine cloth, [[damask]], or [[brocade]], and are brightly coloured (or black, but faced with a bright colour) to distinguish them from lower degrees. They tend to be the most expensive because they must be dyed in a specific colour and/or be trimmed in coloured silks. Many doctoral gowns have a special undress version so adding to the cost of a full set.\n\nA full set may cost about US$360 (\u00a3180) for cheap materials to as much as $5800 (\u00a32900) for high-quality materials.<ref>Ede & Ravenscroft: [[Academic dress of Oxford University#Doctors of Music|Oxford DMus]] undress and full dress academic dress costs \u00a32910 (undress gown: \u00a3181, hood: \u00a3409, rigid mortarboard: \u00a380, full dress gown: \u00a32117, velvet bonnet: \u00a3123). Information retrieved 18 May 2007.</ref> Usually, ex-hire gowns are available for purchase at cheaper prices, though the quality may be lower.<ref>Hired hoods are usually partially lined instead of fully lined when the regulations specify a fully lined hood. However, in some cases, a hood that is specified as fully lined in the regulations, in practice, is part-lined to save on materials. This is especially the case for Glasgow full-shape hoods [f9] as they are large and most of the lining may not be seen when worn.</ref>\n\nMany institutions whose dress includes gowns of varying lengths prescribe the appropriate length of each gown with reference to parts of the wearer's body (undergraduate gowns at Cambridge, for example, must not reach the knees, whereas BA gowns should reach just beyond them, according to the University's statutes). As such, suppliers of academic dress produce gowns in many different sizes to fit persons of different heights.\n\n==By country or district==\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:Academic regalia.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial robe of [[McGill University]]'s principal and chief executive]]\n\n[[File:Scarlet 3.JPG|thumb|right|McGill University's [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]], [[PhD]] regalia dates back to the early 19th century.]]\n\nIn [[Canada]], academic regalia<!-- [[plurale tantum]] --> are worn by university officials, faculty, students, and honoured guests during [[Graduation]] exercises (commonly referred to as Convocation), installations of their presiding officers, and special convocations, such as the inauguration of newly endowed professorial chairs and inductions to some of the honour and professional societies with university chapters. Academic regalia typically consist of a headgear ([[mortarboard]], [[Tudor bonnet]], or [[John Knox cap]]), robe, and hood. Until the 1930s, Canadian universities customarily prescribed academic robes for its professors and students at classes and lectures. At the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto, academic gowns are still required for all students and faculty at Wednesday dinners, most college meetings, debates, and certain special college events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/student-services/other-services/gowns.html|title=Academic Gowns}}</ref>\n\nMost Canadian universities follow or adopted either the British University academic dress at [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]] universities,<ref>Gibson, William (2004).

University Uniforms: The Standardization of Academic Dress in the United States. '''Transactions of the Burgon Society''', 9, p. 140.</ref> Other universities contain elements of the British and American patterns for some or all of their academic costumes. A classic example is the [[academic dress of McGill University]], whose British origins are evident in the regalia of its degree holders. The distinctive ceremonial regalia of [[McGill University]] officials, though, are closer to the American pattern for the master's robe with above-the-elbow, square, slit-cut sleeves. The scarlet, doctor of philosophy (PhD) regalia of McGill can now be worn closed-front, unlike the open-front only gown of the University of Cambridge higher doctoral full dress, from which it evolved. Gold strand tassels used in American doctoral regalia are wrapped around McGill's otherwise Tudor-style bonnet or tam.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Docteurs-SorbonneUniversit\u00e9s-13.jpg|thumbnail|Doctors of various faculties, Paris]]\nIn [[France]], academic dress, also called the ''toge'' (from the word ''[[toga]]'', an ancient Roman garment), is similar to French judges' court dress, except for its colour, which depends on the academic field in which the wearer graduated. It is nowadays little worn, except by doctors during the opening of the university year or the ceremony for a doctorate ''[[honoris causa]]''. For doctors, it consists of:\n* A long gown (a bit similar to a cassock) with a long row of buttons (traditionally, 33, but nowadays usually fewer) in front and a train at the back (which in the current costume is not visible but attached with a button in the inner side of the gown). The gown is in two colours: black and the standard colour of the academic field in which the wearer graduated (see below), with [[simar]]s (two vertical bands in the front of the gown).\n* An ''\u00e9pitoge'' (epitoga): A piece of cloth with white fur stripes (three for doctors) attached by a button on the left shoulder, with a rectangular, long, thin tail in the front and a triangular, shorter, broad tail in the back (both tails carry the fur stripes); its colour is that of the relevant academic field. The epitoga has evolved from the academic hood, which explains why the French academic dress does not include a hood.\n* A long, wide belt or sash, either black or of the colour of the relevant academic field, ended by fringes (which may be golden or of the same colour as the belt), and attached with a broad, ornamental knot.\n* A white ''rabat'' ([[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]), over which a white tie may be worn for ceremonial occasions: It is made of lace for the Dean of the Faculty, the President of the University, and a few other officials, of plain cotton for others.\n* Traditionally only for men, a mortarboard of the colour of the relevant academic field with a golden stripe, which is usually not worn but carried (since the academic dress in France is rarely worn outdoors, and men are not supposed to wear hats indoors), and often even omitted. Nowadays the practice is more relaxed, and the mortarboard is sometimes seen worn by women or worn indoor by men.\n* In principle, a white bow tie (for men only ; quite rarely seen) and white gloves (nowadays never used).\n\nProfessors who served 20 years are sometimes presented with a sword (identical model to that of French police commissars).\n\nThe colours of the various academic fields are daffodil (yellow) for literature and arts, amaranth (purplish red) for science, redcurrant (reddish pink) for medicine, scarlet red for law, and violet (purple) for theology. University rectors, chancellors or presidents wear also specific costumes, which are violet regardless of the academic field in which they graduated.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Both are identical in form, and differ only in the presence or absence of the mortarboard and the repartition of colours on the gown and sash (the other elements of the dress, especially the epitoga, being identical for both):\n* for the ''petit costume'', the gown is all black, except the simarras which are of the colour of the academic field; the buttons are black; the sash and its fringes moir\u00e9 black; the mortarboard is usually not worn;\n* for the ''grand costume'', the gown is black between the simarras, which are moir\u00e9 black, and of the colour of the academic field on the sides and on the sleeves, except their turn-ups, which are black; the buttons are of the colour of the academic field; the sash is of the colour of the academic field, its fringes may be either the same colour or gold.\n\nIn formal occasions, the ''grand costume'' is equivalent to [[white tie]], whereas the ''petit costume'' is equivalent to [[black tie]].\n\n===Germany===\n[[File:Freie Universitaet Berlin - Talare.jpg|right|thumb|Academic robes of the [[Free University of Berlin]]]]\n\nGerman academic dress generally consists of gown and cap. Nowadays, if in use at all, it is only found at special occasions, such as public processions, inaugurations of rectors, and graduation ceremonies. Historically, only the rectors, deans, professors, and lecturers wore academic dress\u2014not students or graduates. Each German university had its own system of colours and drapings to signify [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] membership and position in the university hierarchy.\n\nThe gown of the German academic dress is called \"Talar\" (with the accent on the second \"a\": tal\u00e1r; from Latin ''talare'' which means ''to the ankles''). It can be traced back to the every day clothes of the scholars in the Middle Ages. The same word ''Talar'' is also used for the robes of Protestant (Lutheran) pastors and rabbis (not for judges or lawyers, their gowns are called \"Robe\"), although these gowns often differ more or less in cut, length, drappings, and sometimes even in colour (the gowns of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Supreme Court]] are, e.g., completely dark red).\n\nThe professorial ''Talar'' can be described as a long black gown with wide sleeves, often with lapels in faculty colour, while deans wear a ''Talar'' completely in faculty colour.

In general they are long gowns with bell sleeves. There are some distinctive differences for each academic degree: for example, the length of undergraduate gown is usually below knee; for master's degrees, the gown is longer than undergraduate; and for doctoral degrees, the gown has a [[velvet]] panel (or [[velour]] for fabric substitution) on the front and sleeve.\n* '''Cape or Hood''' \u2013 In most universities capes are commonly used for undergraduates/bachelor's degree students, meanwhile hoods are commonly used for graduate students (master/doctoral) and academic staff. A cape/hood is also colour-coded according to the field of study/faculty.\n* '''Cap''' \u2013 For undergraduate and master's degrees a mortarboard is worn.

The beret is usually a soft cap, square or round and made of velvet; the gown (ankle-length, open in the front), is made of wool trimmed with velvet or silk It is traditionally black, as in the robes of early-modern humanists; some universities have gowns with wide slashed sleeves edged in faculty-specific colours, others have a decorated sleeve but without specific faculty colours. Recently established universities may show a greater variety of colours.\n\nAcademic dress is only worn on ceremonial occasions: the university anniversary or ''dies natalis'', inaugural lectures, and the public defence of a doctoral thesis. On such occasions, the assembled professors line up as a ''cort\u00e8ge'' headed by the university beadle, who also wears an academic gown and carries the university's mace. Male professors remove their beret when sitting down and put it on when standing up (e.g. to lecture or to address a doctoral candidate during the thesis defence). Female professors may keep the beret on at all times.\n\nAcademic dress may be completed by a chain of office (for the presiding Rector or Dean) or the insignia of honorary doctorates or royal orders (only worn at the ''dies natalis'').\n\n===New Zealand===\nUniversity graduates in New Zealand wear an academic gown identical to those of the [[University of Cambridge]]<ref name=\"auckland.ac.nz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-what-to-wear-to-graduation#s2c4 |title=What to wear to graduation \u2013 The University of Auckland |publisher=Auckland.ac.nz |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and either a hood or scarf, depending on whether the graduate is receiving a degree or diploma.

A Bachelor's degree hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white fur (the exception to this are Canterbury and Waikato University which do not line their hoods with fur). The bachelor's degree with Honours hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white satin. The master's degree hood has no edging. A doctoral degree recipient wears the same as a graduate receiving a Masters, except the gown is completely silk, either black or scarlet, with the option to wear a cloth gown. A Doctoral hood is completely silk and the headdress is a black Tudor bonnet, in place of the flat-topped mortarboard worn with Bachelor's and Master's gowns.\n\nAcademic dress is rarely worn in New Zealand other than at formal academic events, such as by graduates and faculty at graduation ceremonies and teaching faculty at school prizegivings. Some traditional boys' high schools retain the tradition of the headmaster wearing a gown while leading assemblies. Undergraduates who live at College House at the [[University of Canterbury]] must wear academic dress to dinner.\n\nBelow is a list of the general hood colours of graduates:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The birreta and mozetta are worn by those from the Graduate School and the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. Graduates of the Bachelors' programs wear the traditional mortarboard, hood and gown. The professors of the University wear their academic regalia during the Missa de Apertura or the Opening Mass of the Academic Year aside from Solemn Investitures (graduation ceremonies) and other academic activities. The academic colours are unique to this university as these depend on the official color of the faculty or college a student or an academe belongs into.\n\nA unique graduation garb worn at member universities of the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines System]] is the use of the ''Sablay''. The ''Sablay'' was inspired from the Malong of Muslim Mindanao thus, giving it a Filipiniana look. It features the indigenous [[baybayin]] characters for \"U\" and \"P\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcrd.upd.edu.ph/?p=761|title= UP Sablay|accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> During the commencement ceremony, graduates wear the ''Sablay'' at the right shoulder, it is then moved to the left shoulder after the President of the University confers their degree, \"similar to the moving of the tassel of the academic cap.\" The ''Sablay'' is worn over traditional Filipino attire \u2013 [[Barong Tagalog]] for men and Filipiniana dress for women. The garb was first worn at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]. Other UP campuses followed suit.\n\nElementary and high school students also wear a certain kind of academic dress upon their graduation, usually a white gown and mortarboard for public schools. For private schools, the gown and mortarboard's color is at the discretion of the administration. There are several schools which make use of a hood-like design on top of their gowns which bears the school colors.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" align=\"center\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:sablay4.jpg|[[University of the Philippines Diliman|UP Diliman]] graduates preparing for the march\nImage:sablay.jpg|[[University of the Philippines Diliman|UP Diliman]] graduation ceremonies\nImage:Rector Herminio Dagohoy of Santo Tomas.jpg|The [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], in full Spanish academic attire, wearing the [[Biretta#Academic biretta|academic biretta]] and the [[mozetta]] over the Dominican habit\n</gallery>\n\n===Poland===\nThe wearing of traditional academic dress is an important feature of Polish educational ceremonies.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" align=\"center\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Ryszard Kaczorowski 21 02 2008 (4).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Portugal===\nAcademic dress varies from university to university.

A common distinction is for graduands in all degrees up to and including the master's degree to have black gowns, while the PhD candidate wears a scarlet gown. These days, academic dress is only used at graduation ceremonies. The wearing of traditional African attire, or modern clothes inspired by traditional attire, beneath the academic dress has been a distinct trend in recent years.\n\n===Spain===\n''This article is partially translated from [[:es:Indumentaria acad\u00e9mica hisp\u00e1nica]]''\n\n[[File:HonoriscausaValladolid.jpg|left|300px|thumb|''[[Honoris causa]]'' doctorates wearing the Spanish doctor's academic dress for Sciences at the [[University of Valladolid]], [[Spain]].]]\nThe typical Spanish academic dress has Latin origin. It has been regulated since 1850, when Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] established several rules about academic dress, according to the centuries-old Spanish custom. The typical Spanish academic dress for doctors is composed by:\n* A black long gown (''toga'') with a long row of buttons, made of satin and wool. It is worn over a black suit.\n* A [[mozzetta]] (''muceta''), whose colour depends on the academic field.\n* Long cuffs (''pu\u00f1etas'') of the same fabric and color than the mozetta, covered by white cotton lace. Those of the ''Rector'' (University president) are bright red or pink, and the lace is usually silken. The buttons are made of gold for the Rector and made of silver for the Deans.\n* An octagonal, tasseled [[biretta]] (''birrete''), whose colour depends on the academic field. Tassels of doctors holding more than one degree in separate fields alternate the corresponding colors.\n* White gloves.\n* A ring is usually worn by doctors.\n* A staff or scepter (''bast\u00f3n'') made of American reed is carried by the University rector.\n* Medallions are often worn by postgraduates, doctors, professors, deans and the University rector.\n[[File:Birrete doctoral.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Doctorates wearing the Spanish doctor's academic dress with colours used for the various academic fields.]]\n[[File:Proc acade.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Academic procession at the [[Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University of Elche]].]]\nHowever, this academic dress is only used for the opening of the academic year and for PhD graduations or for doctorates ''[[honoris causa]]''. It is worn only by doctors, deans and the University Rector. For other graduates, the academic dress is often composed by a [[mortarboard]] and a mozzetta (''muceta'') or a sash over the shoulder (''beca'') with the shield of the University and/or Faculty. The colour of the mozzetta or the sash depends on the academic field.\n\nThe colours used in Spain for the various academic fields are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Academic field\n!Colour name\n!Sample\n|-\n|[[Psychology]]\n|[[Lilac]]\n| style=\"background:#c8a2c8;\"|\n|-\n|[[Pharmacy]]\n|[[Purple]]\n| style=\"background:#c54b8c;\"|\n|-\n|[[Odontology]]\n|[[Fuchsia (color)|Fuchsia]]\n| style=\"background:#ff34b3;\"|\n|-\n|[[Law]]\n|[[Red]]\n| style=\"background:#ff2400;\"|\n|-\n|[[Architecture]], [[Engineering]]\n|[[Brown]]\n| style=\"background:#964b00;\"|\n|-\n|[[Economics]], [[Business]], [[Political Sciences]], [[Sociology]]\n|[[Orange (colour)|Orange]]\n| style=\"background:#ff7f00;\"|\n|-\n|[[Medicine]]\n|[[Gold (color)|Gold]]\n| style=\"background:gold;\"|\n|-\n|[[Art]], [[Theology]]\n|[[White]]\n| style=\"background:white;\"|\n|-\n|[[Veterinary Medicine]]\n|[[Green]]\n| style=\"background:green;\"|\n|-\n|[[Sport Sciences]]\n|[[Light green]]\n| style=\"background:#7cfc00;\"|\n|-\n|[[Translation]], [[Interpreting]]\n|[[Teal]]\n| style=\"background:#20b2aa;\"|\n|-\n|[[Philosophy]], [[Literature]]\n|[[Sky blue]]\n| style=\"background:#add8e6;\"|\n|-\n|[[Learning Sciences]]\n|[[Light blue (color)|Light Blue]]\n| style=\"background:#00bfff;\"|\n|-\n|[[Natural Sciences]], Exact Sciences\n|[[Dark (\"Turk\") blue]]\n| style=\"background:#0000CD;\"|\n|-\n|[[Nursing]]\n|[[Grey]]\n| style=\"background:silver;\"|\n|-\n|[[Journalism]]\n|[[Lead grey]]\n| style=\"background:gray;\"|\n|-\n|[[Rector (academia)|Rector]]\n|[[Black]]\n| style=\"background:black;\"|\n|}\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn Sri Lanka, the academic dress consists of gown, hood (post-graduate) and a garland (on graduation day). Universities that were affiliated to the former [[University of Ceylon]] issue black gowns for graduates and post graduates; red gowns for masters and Phd graduates; crimson gowns for chancellors with a different colour gowns for senior academic faculty. These universities only issue [[garland]] on the graduation day to new graduates and only issue mortar boards to chancellor, vice chancellor and registrars. Private universities issue mortar boards to graduates along with a hood in place of garland.\n\n===Sweden and Finland===\n[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat from the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. (photograph taken on top of a mirror)]]\n[[File:Finnish doctoral hat.JPG|thumb|right|Finnish doctoral hat for a doctor of science from the [[University of Oulu]].]]\n\nFinland and Sweden have similar traditions when it comes to academic clothing. For important academic ceremonies [[white tie]] is usually worn, however, often with traditional headwear and gowns. Gowns are not generally used except by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] as a symbol of office, if anyone.\n\nThe regular [[student cap]] (Finnish: ''ylioppilaslakki'', Swedish: ''studentm\u00f6ssa'') usually has a white velvet crown, a black band and a black beak. The cap can be worn by anyone who has passed the [[matriculation examination]] and is acceptable wear for both formal and informal academic celebrations. Technology students wear a special kind of student cap called a ''teekkarilakki'' (Finnish) or ''teknologm\u00f6ssa'' (Swedish). It is similar to the traditional student cap, but features a tuft and a distinctive [[cockade]] to show which university the wearer is attending. Technology students generally wear their caps more frequently, and thus the tuft often symbolizes university engineering students. Although universities have different rules regarding the use of the cap, it is generally not awarded to the student until he or she has completed the first year of their studies. The technology student's hat may also be seen on informal occasions, being worn with the [[student overall]] at many universities.\n\nIn both countries many universities have [[doctoral hat]]s for persons who have completed a PhD or similar degree. These usually resemble [[top hats]] and must be worn with [[white tie]]. Like other hats, they are not generally worn indoors, but they may be presented on a table. Events where the hat and white tie are worn include thesis defences, post-doctoral parties, ceremonial conferments of degrees, opening ceremonies and other formal ceremonies related to the university.<ref>Sirkka Lassila, 1990. ''Uusi k\u00e4yt\u00f6ksen kultainen kirja''. Suuri Suomalainen Kirjakerho, Helsinki. Page 518.</ref> At some universities, a [[doctoral ring]] is awarded together with the hat. In the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', one scene shows the conferral of a Jubilee doctor degree on the main character at the [[University of Lund]], which includes the presentation of such a hat and ring. At the [[University of Helsinki]] a cape and a sword are commonly worn with the doctoral hat. Students of the student organization \"Limes\" may also be seen wearing a black cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limes.fi/fi/jarjesto/tiedostot/cat_view/41-viralliset-asiat.html |title=Tiedostot &#124; Viralliset asiat |publisher=Limes.fi |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914153957/http://www.limes.fi/fi/jarjesto/tiedostot/cat_view/41-viralliset-asiat.html |archivedate=14 September 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\nAcademic dress used by universities in Thailand follow two traditions. Some universities use a traditional robe of the Siamese Court known as ''[[suea khrui]]'', ([[Chulalongkorn University]], the country's first university, is in this group), while others follow Western styles. Even among the Thai universities which choose to follow the Western traditions, there are those with \"American-style\" academic gowns, and also at least one university ([[Thammasat University]], the second-oldest university of Thailand), which prefers the \"French-style\" gown (completed with the \u00e9pitoge (epitoga) over the shoulder) instead.\n\n===Tunisia===\nIn [[Tunisia]], [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] graduates wear an academic gown. Doctoral graduates in Islamic Sciences wear a jebba.\n<br>\nIn other Tunisian universities, Like the Medicine university, Doctoral graduates wear an academic dress.\n[[File:Jebba.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Tunisian Jebba.]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n{{details|Academic dress in the United Kingdom}}{{see also|Academic dress of the University of Dublin|Academic dress of the National University of Ireland}}\n\n[[File:OU-graduate.jpg|right|thumb|An alternative coloured gown, [[The Open University]], MEd.]]\n[[File:Bishop Andrewes cap.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The Bishop Andrewes cap as used for [[University of Cambridge]] [[Doctor of Divinity|DDs]].]]\n\nThere is a distinction between different types of academical dress. Most recently, gowns, hoods and caps are categorised into their shape and patterns by the [[Groves classification system]], which is based on Nicholas Groves' document, ''Hood and Gown Patterns''.<ref>The Burgon Society: [http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php The Design of Academical Dress] (6 May 2007) Classification of Styles</ref> This lists the various styles or patterns of academic dress and assigns them a code or a [[Groves Classification Number]]. For example, the Cambridge BA style gown is designated [b2] and a hood in the Cambridge full-shape is designated [f1], etc. Because the universities are free to design their own academicals using a wide range of available gown, hood and cap patterns, colours and materials at their and the robemaker's disposal, the academicals of two given universities rarely clash with each other.\n\nThe [[Burgon Society]] was founded in 2000 to promote the study of academic dress.<ref>[http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/index.php Burgon Society: Introduction] (2 November 2008)</ref> Its publications and activities examine the history and current use of academic dress and in 2011 it published the third edition of Shaw's reference book on British and Irish academical dress.<ref>Groves, Nicholas. \"Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland\", London: Burgon Society, 2011.</ref> The Society hosts a conference each spring at which recent research is presented.<ref>\"Meeting of the Burgon Society.\" http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/meetings.php</ref>\n\nThe modern gown is derived from the ''roba'' worn under the ''cappa clausa'', a garment resembling a long black cape. In early medieval times, all students at the universities were in at least [[minor orders]], and were required to wear the ''cappa'' or other clerical dress, and restricted to clothes of black or other dark colour. The gowns most commonly worn, that of the clerical type gowns of [[Bachelor's degree]]s (BA and BS) and [[Master's degree]]s (MA and MS), are substantially the same throughout the English-speaking world. All are traditionally made of black cloth, (although occasionally the gown is dyed in one of the university's colours) and the material at the back of the gown is gathered into a yoke. The Bachelor's gown has bell-shaped sleeves, while the Master's gown has long sleeves closed at the end, with the arm passing through a slit above the elbow.<ref name=\"Shaw4-7\">Shaw (1995); pp. 4\u20137</ref>\n\nThere are two distinctive shapes used in the UK for doctor's gowns; the Oxford doctor's shape and the Cambridge doctor's shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge Doctor of Music dress gown which is a pattern between the two. The other form of doctor's gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress gown instead; however, the undress gown still plays a part in the older universities where academic dress is usually worn.\n\nUndergraduates at many older universities also wear gowns;<ref>Hargreaves-Mawdsley, pp. 91\u2013101, 128\u2013135, 146, 148\u2013149</ref> the most common essentially a smaller knee-length version of the Bachelor's gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is a sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherdandwoodward.co.uk/acatalog/Oxford_University_Student_Gowns.html |title=Shepherd & Woodward: Oxford University student gowns |publisher=Shepherdandwoodward.co.uk |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucags/spotter.htm |title=CU Cap & Gown Society: Gown-spotter's guide |publisher=Srcf.ucam.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305071759/http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucags/spotter.htm |archivedate=5 March 2009  }}</ref> Undergraduates at St Andrews, with the exception of theology students, commonly wear scarlet woollen gowns with velvet collars.<ref>http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/staff/resourcesfornewstaff/universityintroduction/studentsatstandrews/universityofstandrewstraditions/traditionalredgowns/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities.\n\nAnother form of dress, now rarely seen, is the habit, which is worn over a black gown. Only Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Newcastle use habits and mainly reserve their use for very formal ceremonial occasions and to a specific group of academics or officials.\n\nThe hood was originally a functional garment, worn to shield the head from the elements. In the English tradition, it has developed to an often bright and decorative garment worn only on special occasions. Hoods comprise two basic patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood consists of a cape, [[cowl]], and [[liripipe]], as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelors' and masters' hoods use simple hoods that have lost their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe.<ref>''Burgon Annual 2003'' (2004); pp. 18\u201323</ref> The colour and [[lining (sewing)|lining]] of hoods in academic dress represents the rank and/or faculty of the wearer.<ref>Groves (2008), ''Hood Key''</ref> In many Commonwealth universities bachelors wear hoods edged or lined with white rabbit fur, while masters wear hoods lined with coloured silk (originally ermine or other expensive fur). Doctors' hoods are normally made of scarlet cloth and lined with coloured silk.<ref>Shaw (1995); p. 8</ref> Faculty colours were introduced by the University of London and many universities followed suit.<ref>''Burgon Transactions'' vol. 5 (2006); pp. 80\u201389</ref>\n\nThe [[academic cap]] or square, commonly known as the mortarboard, has come to be symbolic of academia. In some universities it can be worn by graduates and undergraduates alike. It is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top centre of the board. The mortarboard may also be referred to as a [[trencher cap]] (or simply trencher). The [[tassel]] is composed of a cluster of silk threads which are wrapped together with a cord which is attached to the button affixed to the centre of the headpiece. The loose strands are allowed to fall freely over the board edge, typically falling over the left front side of the cap. Often the strands are [[Braid|plaited]] together to form a cord with the end threads left untied. In many universities, holders of doctorates wear a soft-crowned, round-brimmed headpiece known as a [[Tudor bonnet]] or [[tam (cap)|tam]], rather than a trencher. Other types of hats used, especially in some universities in the UK, are the [[John Knox cap]] (mostly at Scottish universities), the [[Bishop Andrewes cap]] (a reinvention of the ancient form of the mortarboard, worn by Cambridge [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]] DD's) and the [[Pileus (hat)#University of Sussex pileus|pileus]] (at Sussex). In some universities, such as Oxford, women may wear an Oxford ladies' cap.<ref>Goff; pp.22\u201323</ref>\n\nOfficers of the universities generally wear distinctive and more elaborate dress. The [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] and the [[Vice-Chancellor]] may wear a black damask lay type gown (sometimes with a long train) trimmed with gold or silver [[lace]] and [[frog (fastening)|frogs]]. They wear a velvet mortarboard, similarly trimmed with gold braid and tassel. Other than this gown, they may have other distinct forms of dress, such as the scarlet ''cappa clausa'' or [[cope]] worn in certain circumstances by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge or his/her deputy and by higher doctors presenting candidates for degrees, which was once worn by [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]].<ref>Shaw (1966); pp. 94\u201395</ref> In the past, Chancellors may also wear full court dress with breeches and court shoes like that of the [[Lord Chancellor]] of Great Britain.\n\nAt degree ceremonies, graduands often dress in the academic dress of the degree they are about to be admitted to prior to the actual graduation ceremony. This is not the case at several of the older universities in the UK, most notably, Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews which have their own distinct traditions.\n\nIn addition to universities and colleges, a number of British professional bodies, such as the [[Institute of Biology]] and the [[Institute of Physics]] grant academic dress to their members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/practice/regs/other.php|title=Regulations for other Institutions and Societies|publisher=[[Burgon Society]]|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Academic regalia in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Harvard University Doctoral Gown and Hood.jpg|thumb|right|The Harvard doctoral gown and hood, which do not entirely follow the American Council on Education system.]]\n[[File:phdposing.png|thumb|right|Professors and newly conferred doctors of philosophy posing at a [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] graduation.]]\n[[File:Jacob1207b.JPG|thumb|right|150px|American academic dress is typically closed at the front and properly worn with the prescribed cap, as well as the hood.

There is an Inter-Collegiate code which sets out a detailed uniform scheme of academic regalia followed by most, though some institutions do not adhere to it entirely, and fewer still ignore it.\n\nThe practice of wearing academic regalia in the United States dates to the [[Colonial Colleges]] period, and was heavily influenced by European practices and styles.<ref name=overview>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Historical Overview''</ref> Students of most colonial colleges were required to wear the \"college habit\" at most times \u2013 a practice that lasted until the eve of the [[American Civil War]] in many institutions of higher learning.<ref name=RegaliaOfPrinceton>Smagorinsky. ''The Regalia of Princeton University: Pomp, Circumstance, and Accoutrements of Academia''. Page 5.</ref> In some rare instances the practice has persisted, such as at [[Sewanee: The University of the South|Sewanee]], where members of the student honor society, along with most professors, continue to wear the gown to class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sewanee.edu/og/about |title=About \u2013 The Order of Gownsmen \u2013 Sewanee :: The University of the South |publisher=Sewanee.edu |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529201410/http://www.sewanee.edu/og/about |archivedate=29 May 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> After the Civil War, academic regalia was generally only worn at ceremonies or when representing the institution.<ref name=RegaliaOfPrinceton /> There was not, however, any standardization among the meanings behind the various costumes. In 1893, an Intercollegiate Commission made up of representatives from leading institutions was created, to establish an acceptable system of academic dress. The Commission met at Columbia College (now [[Columbia University]]) in 1895 and adopted a code of academic regalia, which prescribed the cut and style and materials of the gowns, as well as determined the colours which were to represent the different fields of learning.<ref>New York Times. \"Gowns for College Men; Academic Costumes in American Universities (1896):\nPlan to Secure a Uniform Practice in the Use of the Caps and Gowns in This Country So that the Degree of the Wearer, the Faculty Under Whom It Was Obtained, and the Institution Conferring It May Be Readily Seen.\" Sunday, 26 April 1896.</ref> In 1932 the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) authorized the appointment of a committee to determine whether revision and completion of the academic code adopted by the conference of the colleges and universities in 1895 is desirable at this time, and, if so, to draft a revised code and present a plan for submitting the code to the consideration of the institutional members of the council.\n\nThe committee reviewed the situation and approved a code for academic costumes that has been in effect since that year. A ''Committee on Academic Costumes and Ceremonies'', appointed by the American Council on Education in 1959, again reviewed the academic dress code and made several changes.<ref name=overview />\n\nAlthough academic dress is now rarely worn outside [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremonies or other academic rituals such as [[encaenia]] in the U.S. graduation ceremonies have gained popularity and have expanded from high school graduations to middle school, elementary school and kindergarten graduation ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymeuniversity.com |title=Kindergarten graduation in the United States |publisher=Rhymeuniversity.com |accessdate=28 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510095619/http://rhymeuniversity.com/| archivedate= 10 May 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelors']] and [[Master's degree|masters']] gowns in the United States are similar to their counterparts in the United Kingdom, though bachelor's gowns are now designed to be worn closed, and all are at least mid-calf length to ankle-length.<ref name=SullivanGowns>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Gowns''</ref> The masters' gown sleeve is [[rectangle|oblong]] and, though the base of the sleeve hangs down in the typical manner, it is square cut at the rear part of the oblong shape. The front part has an arc cut away, and there is a slit for the wrist opening, but the rest of the arc is closed. The shape is evocative of the square-cut [[liripipe]] incorporated into many academic hoods (''see'', below). The master's gown is designed to be worn open or closed.<ref name=SullivanGowns />\n\n[[Doctorate|Doctoral]] robes are typically black, although some schools use robes in the [[school colors|school's colours]].<ref name=SullivanGowns /> The Code calls for the outside shell of the hood (''see'', below) to remain black in that case, however. In general, doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by bachelor's graduates, with the addition of three velvet bands on the sleeves and velvet facing running down the front of the gown. The Code calls for the gown trim to be either black or the colour designated for the field of study in which the doctorate was earned (see ''[[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]''). However, in the case of the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), although it is awarded for study in any number of fields, the dark blue velvet of philosophy is always used regardless of the particular field studied. For example, if not choosing black trim, a PhD in theology would wear velvet gown trim in dark blue, while a [[Doctor of Theology]] (Th.D.) would wear scarlet trim, if not choosing black. The robes have full sleeves, instead of the bell sleeves of the bachelor's gown. Some gowns expose a [[necktie]] or [[cravat]] when closed, while others take an almost cape-like form. It is designed to be worn open or closed in the front.<ref name=SullivanGowns />\n\nThe Code calls for the shell material of the hood to match the robe, and for the colour to be black regardless of the colour of the robe being worn.<ref name=SullivanHoods>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods''</ref> The interior lining \u2013 generally silk \u2013 displays the colours of the institution from which the wearer received the degree, in a pattern prescribed by it (usually, if more than one colour is used, [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] or equal divisions).<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods'';''Linings''</ref> The opening of the hood is [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] in [[velvet]] or [[velveteen]].<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods''; ''Trimmings''</ref> In most American colleges and universities, the colour of the velvet hood trimming is distinctive of the academic field \u2013 or as closely related as possible \u2013 to which the degree earned pertains (see ''[[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]'').<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Additional Guidance on Costume''</ref> Many institutions, particularly larger ones, have dispensed with the bachelor's hood at commencement ceremonies altogether, though a graduate is still entitled to wear one once the degree is conferred.<ref name=SullivanExceptions>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Some Permissible Exceptions''</ref>\n\nHeadwear is an important component of cap-and-gown, and the academic costume is not complete without it. The headwear will vary with the level of academic achievement and, to some extent, on the individual academic institution's specifications. For caps, the mortarboard is recommended in the Code, and the material required to match the gown.<ref name=SullivanCaps>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Caps''</ref> The exception\u2014velvet\u2014is reserved for the doctor's degree only, seen in the form of a multiple-sided (4, 6, or 8) [[tam (cap)|tam]], but the four-sided mortarboard-shaped tam in velvet is what the Code seems to recommend here.<ref name=SullivanCaps /> The only colour called for is black, in all cases.<ref name=SullivanCaps /> The tassel worn on the mortarboard or a tam seems to provide, by tradition, the greatest opportunity for latitude in American academic dress. It has been black, or represented the university's colours, or the colours of the specific college, or the discipline. The tassel has also been used to indicate membership in national [[honor society|honour societies]] or other awards. There is at some colleges and universities a practice of moving the tassel from one side to the other on graduating, but this is a modern innovation that would be impractical out of doors due to the vagaries of the wind. For doctoral and masters students, the tassel commonly begins and remains on the left.<ref name=SullivanWearing>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Wearing the Costume''</ref>\n\nThe colours allocated to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume, and accepted by the American Council on Education in its ''Academic Costume Code.''<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns /> Some of the more common colours seen are that [[liberal arts]] is represented by white, science by golden yellow, medicine by green, law by purple, theology by scarlet, and philosophy (including all PhD degrees) by dark blue. A distinction is made in the code, which calls for a graduate to display the colour of the subject of the degree obtained, not the degree itself.<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/> For example, if a graduate is awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree specifically in business the trimming should be drab, representing commerce/accountancy/business, rather than white, representing the broader arts/letters/humanities; the same method is true of master's degrees and doctorates. However, in 1986, the American Council on Education updated the Code and added the following sentence clarifying the use of the colour dark blue for the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, which is awarded in any number of fields: \"In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree, the dark blue colour is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field that is attested to by the awarding of the degree, and it is not intended to represent the field of philosophy.\"<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/>\n\nA number of other items such as [[honor cords|cords]], [[academic stole|stoles]], [[aiguillette]]s, etc. representing various academic achievements or other honours are also worn at the discretion of some degree-granting institutions. Technically, however, the ACE code does not allow their use on or over academic regalia.\n\n==Pontifical universities==\nAcademic dress for [[Pontifical university|pontifical universities]] tends to vary by the host country. Traditionally, for doctors of a pontifical university or faculty \"the principal mark of a Doctor's dignity is the four horned biretta.\"<ref>John Abel Nainfa, Costume of Prelates of The Catholic Church: According To Roman Etiquette, 164.</ref> under the [[1917 Code of Canon Law|old Code of Canon Law]], in [[commencement ceremony|commencement ceremonies]] and other academic settings, doctors from pontifical faculties and universities had a canonical right to wear the doctoral biretta, as stated in can. 1378, and explained in commentary 262 of the Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici as follows:\n{{quote|262.

Three-horned birettas are to be used by Licentiates, four-horned for Doctors.\n\nAcademic dress for the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] graduates consists of a black toga or academic gown with trim to follow the color of the faculty, and an academic ring. For the doctoral degree a four corned [[biretta]] is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned [[biretta]] is to be worn.

Today, the ensembles are distinctive in some way to each institution, and generally consist of a [[gown]] (also known as a [[robe]]) with a separate [[hood (headgear)|hood]], and usually a cap (generally either a [[square academic cap]], a [[tam (cap)|tam]], or a [[Tudor bonnet|bonnet]]). Academic dress is also worn by members of certain [[learned societies]] and institutions as official dress.<ref>e.g. [http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/robes.php Burgon Society: Robes]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facs.org/archives/congresshighlight.html |title=History and Archives of the American College of Surgeons; Highlight of the Month October 10, 2005; The Clinical Congress: Then and Now, accessed 01/29/2008 |publisher=Facs.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519122103/http://facs.org/archives/congresshighlight.html |archivedate=19 May 2011  }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe academic dress found in most universities in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States]] is derived from that of the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which was a development of academic and clerical dress common throughout the [[medieval university|medieval universities]] of [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phildress.co.uk/london/origins.html |title=Goff, pp. 13\u201314 |publisher=Phildress.co.uk |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515070306/http://www.phildress.co.uk/london/origins.html |archivedate=15 May 2011  }}</ref> <!--, itself a development of the academic robes worn in the medieval [[Madrasah]]s of the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Christian-Muslim Relations|first=Hugh|last=Goddard|year=2000|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=074861009X|page=100|isbn status=May be invalid \u2013 please double check|postscript=None}}-->\n\nFormal or sober clothing is typically worn beneath the gown so, for example, men would often wear a dark [[suit (clothes)|suit]] with a white [[shirt]] and a [[Necktie|tie]], or [[clerical clothing]], [[military uniform|military]] or civil [[uniform]], or [[national dress]], and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as ''[[subfusc]]'') to be worn under the gown. Although some universities are relaxed about what people wear under their gowns, it is nevertheless considered bad form to be in [[casual wear]] or the like during graduation ceremonies, and a number of universities may bar finishing students from joining the procession or the ceremony itself if not appropriately dressed<ref>{{cite web|author=n.wood@sheffield.ac.uk |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/eventsteam/wear.html |title=University of Sheffield: What should I wear? |publisher=Shef.ac.uk |accessdate=28 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405090210/http://www.shef.ac.uk/eventsteam/wear.html| archivedate= 5 April 2010| url-status= live}}</ref> (though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress and not what is worn beneath it, if unseen). In the Commonwealth, gowns are worn open, while in the United States, with the exception of the academic dress of the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], it has become common for gowns to close at the front, as did the original ''roba''.\n\n==Materials==\nIn general, the materials used for academic dress are heavily influenced by the climate where the academic institution is located, or the climate where the graduate will usually be wearing the costume (as a faculty member at another institution, for example). In either case, the American Council of Education (ACE) allows for the comfort of the wearer, and concedes that lighter materials be used in tropical climates, and heavier materials elsewhere.<ref>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Gowns, ''Material''</ref> In addition, it acknowledges cotton poplin, broadcloth, rayon, or silk as appropriate.<ref>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, Caps, ''Material''</ref>\n\nThe materials used for academic dress vary and range from the extremely economical to the very expensive. In the United States, most Bachelor and master's degree candidates are often only presented the \"[[souvenir]]\" version of regalia by their institutions or authorized vendor, which are generally intended for very few wearings and are comparatively very inexpensive. For some doctoral graduates, commencement will be the only time they wear academic regalia, and so they rent their gowns instead of buying them. These rented (or hired)<ref>American English uses 'rented', British English uses 'hired'.</ref> gowns are often made of inexpensive [[polyester]] or other man-made synthetic fibre. In Britain, rented gowns are almost always polyester while [[Russell cord]], silk, or artificial silk gowns are only available when bought. Undergraduate gowns are usually made from cotton or cotton and polyester mix and are relatively inexpensive to encourage students to own them.\n\nPeople who choose to buy their dress may opt for finer fabrics, such as [[poplin]], [[grosgrain]], [[percale]], [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[cassimere]], [[broadcloth]], Russell cord, or corded/ribbed material. For silk, there are a range of types including [[artificial silk]]/[[rayon]], [[Ottoman (textile)|Ottoman]] (i.e. ribbed or corded silk), [[taffeta]], [[satin]], [[alpaca]], true [[silk]], [[shot silk]], or a mixture. Pure Ottoman silk is rarely used except for official gowns, as it is very expensive.<ref>An [[Ede & Ravenscroft]] [[Oxford MA]] hood made of pure Ottoman silk will cost around \u00a3347. Source: http://www.gownhire.co.uk (21 September 2007)</ref> Some gowns may be trimmed with [[gimp (thread)#In lace|gimp lace]], cords, buttons, or other forms of decoration.\n\nIn the past, [[fur]] has been used to line certain hoods (especially those of the UK) which range from [[rabbit fur|rabbit]] to [[ermine]]. In the past, [[sheepskin]] was widely used. Most now use imitation fur, instead, mainly because of cost and [[animal rights]] concerns. Some robe makers use fur if the customer requests and pays for it, as some feel that the quality and feel of artificial fur has yet to match that of real fur.<ref>The cost difference between artificial and real fur can be as much as a few hundred pounds.</ref>\n\nDoctor's robes usually use wool [[flannel]], [[panama (wool)|panama]] (worsted), superfine cloth, [[damask]], or [[brocade]], and are brightly coloured (or black, but faced with a bright colour) to distinguish them from lower degrees. They tend to be the most expensive because they must be dyed in a specific colour and/or be trimmed in coloured silks. Many doctoral gowns have a special undress version so adding to the cost of a full set.\n\nA full set may cost about US$360 (\u00a3180) for cheap materials to as much as $5800 (\u00a32900) for high-quality materials.<ref>Ede & Ravenscroft: [[Academic dress of Oxford University#Doctors of Music|Oxford DMus]] undress and full dress academic dress costs \u00a32910 (undress gown: \u00a3181, hood: \u00a3409, rigid mortarboard: \u00a380, full dress gown: \u00a32117, velvet bonnet: \u00a3123). Information retrieved 18 May 2007.</ref> Usually, ex-hire gowns are available for purchase at cheaper prices, though the quality may be lower.<ref>Hired hoods are usually partially lined instead of fully lined when the regulations specify a fully lined hood. However, in some cases, a hood that is specified as fully lined in the regulations, in practice, is part-lined to save on materials. This is especially the case for Glasgow full-shape hoods [f9] as they are large and most of the lining may not be seen when worn.</ref>\n\nMany institutions whose dress includes gowns of varying lengths prescribe the appropriate length of each gown with reference to parts of the wearer's body (undergraduate gowns at Cambridge, for example, must not reach the knees, whereas BA gowns should reach just beyond them, according to the University's statutes). As such, suppliers of academic dress produce gowns in many different sizes to fit persons of different heights.\n\n==By country or district==\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:Academic regalia.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremonial robe of [[McGill University]]'s principal and chief executive]]\n\n[[File:Scarlet 3.JPG|thumb|right|McGill University's [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]], [[PhD]] regalia dates back to the early 19th century.]]\n\nIn [[Canada]], academic regalia<!-- [[plurale tantum]] --> are worn by university officials, faculty, students, and honoured guests during [[Graduation]] exercises (commonly referred to as Convocation), installations of their presiding officers, and special convocations, such as the inauguration of newly endowed professorial chairs and inductions to some of the honour and professional societies with university chapters. Academic regalia typically consist of a headgear ([[mortarboard]], [[Tudor bonnet]], or [[John Knox cap]]), robe, and hood. Until the 1930s, Canadian universities customarily prescribed academic robes for its professors and students at classes and lectures. At the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto, academic gowns are still required for all students and faculty at Wednesday dinners, most college meetings, debates, and certain special college events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/student-services/other-services/gowns.html|title=Academic Gowns}}</ref>\n\nMost Canadian universities follow or adopted either the British University academic dress at [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]] universities,<ref>Gibson, William (2004).

University Uniforms: The Standardization of Academic Dress in the United States. '''Transactions of the Burgon Society''', 9, p. 140.</ref> Other universities contain elements of the British and American patterns for some or all of their academic costumes. A classic example is the [[academic dress of McGill University]], whose British origins are evident in the regalia of its degree holders. The distinctive ceremonial regalia of [[McGill University]] officials, though, are closer to the American pattern for the master's robe with above-the-elbow, square, slit-cut sleeves. The scarlet, doctor of philosophy (PhD) regalia of McGill can now be worn closed-front, unlike the open-front only gown of the University of Cambridge higher doctoral full dress, from which it evolved. Gold strand tassels used in American doctoral regalia are wrapped around McGill's otherwise Tudor-style bonnet or tam.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Docteurs-SorbonneUniversit\u00e9s-13.jpg|thumbnail|Doctors of various faculties, Paris]]\nIn [[France]], academic dress, also called the ''toge'' (from the word ''[[toga]]'', an ancient Roman garment), is similar to French judges' court dress, except for its colour, which depends on the academic field in which the wearer graduated. It is nowadays little worn, except by doctors during the opening of the university year or the ceremony for a doctorate ''[[honoris causa]]''. For doctors, it consists of:\n* A long gown (a bit similar to a cassock) with a long row of buttons (traditionally, 33, but nowadays usually fewer) in front and a train at the back (which in the current costume is not visible but attached with a button in the inner side of the gown). The gown is in two colours: black and the standard colour of the academic field in which the wearer graduated (see below), with [[simar]]s (two vertical bands in the front of the gown).\n* An ''\u00e9pitoge'' (epitoga): A piece of cloth with white fur stripes (three for doctors) attached by a button on the left shoulder, with a rectangular, long, thin tail in the front and a triangular, shorter, broad tail in the back (both tails carry the fur stripes); its colour is that of the relevant academic field. The epitoga has evolved from the academic hood, which explains why the French academic dress does not include a hood.\n* A long, wide belt or sash, either black or of the colour of the relevant academic field, ended by fringes (which may be golden or of the same colour as the belt), and attached with a broad, ornamental knot.\n* A white ''rabat'' ([[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]), over which a white tie may be worn for ceremonial occasions: It is made of lace for the Dean of the Faculty, the President of the University, and a few other officials, of plain cotton for others.\n* Traditionnaly only for men, a mortarboard of the colour of the relevant academic field with a golden stripe, which is usually not worn but carried (since the academic dress in France is rarely worn outdoors, and men are not supposed to wear hats indoors), and often even omitted. Nowadays the practice is more relaxed, and the mortarboard is sometimes seen worn by women or worn indoor by men.\n* In principle, a white bow tie (for men only ; quite rarely seen) and white gloves (nowadays never used).\n\nProfessors who served 20 years are sometimes presented with a sword (identical model to that of French police commissars).\n\nThe colours of the various academic fields are daffodil (yellow) for literature and arts, amaranth (purplish red) for science, redcurrant (reddish pink) for medicine, scarlet red for law, and violet (purple) for theology. University rectors, chancellors or presidents wear also specific costumes, which are violet regardless of the academic field in which they graduated.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Nowadays, if in use at all, it is only found at special occasions, such as public processions, inaugurations of rectors, and graduation ceremonies. Historically, only the rectors, deans, professors, and lecturers wore academic dress\u2014not students or graduates. Each German university had its own system of colours and drapings to signify [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] membership and position in the university hierarchy.\n\nThe gown of the German academic dress is called \"Talar\" (with the accent on the second \"a\": tal\u00e1r; from Latin ''talare'' which means ''to the ankles''). It can be traced back to the every day clothes of the scholars in the Middle Ages. The same word ''Talar'' is also used for the robes of Protestant (Lutheran) pastors and rabbis (not for judges or lawyers, their gowns are called \"Robe\"), although these gowns often differ more or less in cut, length, drappings, and sometimes even in colour (the gowns of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Supreme Court]] are, e.g., completely dark red).\n\nThe professorial ''Talar'' can be described as a long black gown with wide sleeves, often with lapels in faculty colour, while deans wear a ''Talar'' completely in faculty colour. Rectors typically have a distinguished, more elaborate ''Talar'', e.g., made of velvet, coloured in red, or with gold embroidery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wn.de/Muenster/2012/11/Kuriose-Sammlung-im-Universitaetsarchiv-Man-traegt-wieder-Talar|title=Man tr\u00e4gt wieder Talar|date=11 November 2012|website=|publisher=Westf\u00e4lische Nachrichten|language=German|access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-marburg.de/profil/geschichte/insignien/amtstracht|title=Amtstracht des Rektors|website=|publisher=University of Marburg|access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref> At some universities, the rector additionally wears a [[chain of office]] and, at some occasions, carries a [[Sceptre|scepter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/zentrale_einrichtungen/kustodie/folder.2004-11-01.6740168989/weiteres/Die%20neue%20Amtskette%20des%20Rektors|title=Die neue Amtskette des Rektors unserer Universit\u00e4t|date=16 March 2010|website=|publisher=Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden|language=German|access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-marburg.de/profil/geschichte/insignien/szepter_info|title=Die beiden Marburger Universit\u00e4tsszepter|website=|publisher=University of Marburg|language=German|access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref> The cap that accompanies the ''Talar'' is called ''Barett''.

An Indonesian toga generally comes in three pieces of clothing: a gown, a cape or a hood, and a cap with tassel ([[Pentagon|pentagon-shaped]] [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]]/[[Tudor bonnet|bonnet]]). Other items are also worn during graduation ceremony such as a [[medal]]lion, [[tippet]] or [[academic stole]].\n\nThere are four elements in Indonesian academic regalia:\n* '''Gown''' \u2013 Indonesian academic gowns commonly come in black with a different color of trimming according to the field of study/faculty. In general they are long gowns with bell sleeves. There are some distinctive differences for each academic degree: for example, the length of undergraduate gown is usually below knee; for master's degrees, the gown is longer than undergraduate; and for doctoral degrees, the gown has a [[velvet]] panel (or [[velour]] for fabric substitution) on the front and sleeve.\n* '''Cape or Hood''' \u2013 In most universities capes are commonly used for undergraduates/bachelor's degree students, meanwhile hoods are commonly used for graduate students (master/doctoral) and academic staff. A cape/hood is also colour-coded according to the field of study/faculty.\n* '''Cap''' \u2013 For undergraduate and master's degrees a mortarboard is worn. Unlike most academic caps, which are square in shape, the Indonesian cap is usually pentagonal. Another type of cap like Tudor bonnet is generally worn by doctoral students, although in some universities like [[Padjadjaran University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallery.unpad.ac.id/Wisuda%20Agustus%202017/Foto%20Liputan/SESI%20VI/|title=SESI VI {{!}} Foto Liputan {{!}} Wisuda Agustus 2017 {{!}} Foto Wisuda Unpad|website=gallery.unpad.ac.id|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref> the bonnet is worn for all academic degrees.\n* '''Tassel''' \u2013 In most universities, before the commencement ceremony, undergraduates' tassel are placed on the left position, and during the graduation procession students will received their degree scroll/diploma and then move their tassel to the right.

The beret is usually a soft cap, square or round and made of velvet; the gown (ankle-length, open in the front), is made of wool trimmed with velvet or silk It is traditionally black, as in the robes of early-modern humanists; some universities have gowns with wide slashed sleeves edged in faculty-specific colours, others have a decorated sleeve but without specific faculty colours. Recently established universities may show a greater variety of colours.\n\nAcademic dress is only worn on ceremonial occasions: the university anniversary or ''dies natalis'', inaugural lectures, and the public defence of a doctoral thesis. On such occasions, the assembled professors line up as a ''cort\u00e8ge'' headed by the university beadle, who also wears an academic gown and carries the university's mace. Male professors remove their beret when sitting down and put it on when standing up (e.g. to lecture or to address a doctoral candidate during the thesis defence). Female professors may keep the beret on at all times.\n\nAcademic dress may be completed by a chain of office (for the presiding Rector or Dean) or the insignia of honorary doctorates or royal orders (only worn at the ''dies natalis'').\n\n===New Zealand===\nUniversity graduates in New Zealand wear an academic gown identical to those of the [[University of Cambridge]]<ref name=\"auckland.ac.nz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/cs-what-to-wear-to-graduation#s2c4 |title=What to wear to graduation \u2013 The University of Auckland |publisher=Auckland.ac.nz |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and either a hood or scarf, depending on whether the graduate is receiving a degree or diploma.

A Bachelor's degree hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white fur (the exception to this are Canterbury and Waikato University which do not line their hoods with fur). The bachelor's degree with Honours hood is lined with coloured satin and bordered with white satin. The master's degree hood has no edging. A doctoral degree recipient wears the same as a graduate receiving a Masters, except the gown is completely silk, either black or scarlet, with the option to wear a cloth gown. A Doctoral hood is completely silk and the headdress is a black Tudor bonnet, in place of the flat-topped mortarboard worn with Bachelor's and Master's gowns.\n\nAcademic dress is rarely worn in New Zealand other than at formal academic events, such as by graduates and faculty at graduation ceremonies and teaching faculty at school prizegivings. Some traditional boys' high schools retain the tradition of the headmaster wearing a gown while leading assemblies.

The professors of the University wear their academic regalia during the Missa de Apertura or the Opening Mass of the Academic Year aside from Solemn Investitures (graduation ceremonies) and other academic activities. The academic colours are unique to this university as these depend on the official color of the faculty or college a student or an academe belongs into.\n\nA unique graduation garb worn at member universities of the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines System]] is the use of the ''Sablay''. The ''Sablay'' was inspired from the Malong of Muslim Mindanao thus, giving it a Filipiniana look. It features the indigenous [[baybayin]] characters for \"U\" and \"P\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcrd.upd.edu.ph/?p=761|title= UP Sablay|accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> During the commencement ceremony, graduates wear the ''Sablay'' at the right shoulder, it is then moved to the left shoulder after the President of the University confers their degree, \"similar to the moving of the tassel of the academic cap.\" The ''Sablay'' is worn over traditional Filipino attire \u2013 [[Barong Tagalog]] for men and Filipiniana dress for women. The garb was first worn at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]. Other UP campuses followed suit.\n\nElementary and high school students also wear a certain kind of academic dress upon their graduation, usually a white gown and mortarboard for public schools. For private schools, the gown and mortarboard's color is at the discretion of the administration. There are several schools which make use of a hood-like design on top of their gowns which bears the school colors.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" align=\"center\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:sablay4.jpg|[[University of the Philippines Diliman|UP Diliman]] graduates preparing for the march\nImage:sablay.jpg|[[University of the Philippines Diliman|UP Diliman]] graduation ceremonies\nImage:Rector Herminio Dagohoy of Santo Tomas.jpg|The [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], in full Spanish academic attire, wearing the [[Biretta#Academic biretta|academic biretta]] and the [[mozetta]] over the Dominican habit\n</gallery>\n\n===Poland===\nThe wearing of traditional academic dress is an important feature of Polish educational ceremonies.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" align=\"center\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Ryszard Kaczorowski 21 02 2008 (4).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===Portugal===\nAcademic dress varies from university to university. In some situations the hat is not used, e.g. Doctoral Exam.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Doctoral_Exame_ISCTE-IUL.jpg -->\n\nIn Portugal, following an ancient tradition, university regular students also use a specific dressing. The \"Traje Acad\u00e9mico\", as it is known in Portuguese, is recognized by its almost totally black color and cape.\n\n===Singapore===\n{|\n|-\n|[[File:DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY.jpg|thumb|Academic dress for PhD in [[Singapore]] with description]]\n|[[File:MASTERS DEGREE.jpg|thumb|left|Academic dress for Masters in [[Singapore]] with description]]\n|}\n\n===Taiwan===\nTaiwan academic dress generally consists of gown and cap.

A common distinction is for graduands in all degrees up to and including the master's degree to have black gowns, while the PhD candidate wears a scarlet gown. These days, academic dress is only used at graduation ceremonies. The wearing of traditional African attire, or modern clothes inspired by traditional attire, beneath the academic dress has been a distinct trend in recent years.\n\n===Spain===\n''This article is partially translated from [[:es:Indumentaria acad\u00e9mica hisp\u00e1nica]]''\n\n[[File:HonoriscausaValladolid.jpg|left|300px|thumb|''[[Honoris causa]]'' doctorates wearing the Spanish doctor's academic dress for Sciences at the [[University of Valladolid]], [[Spain]].]]\nThe typical Spanish academic dress has Latin origin. It has been regulated since 1850, when Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] established several rules about academic dress, according to the centuries-old Spanish custom. The typical Spanish academic dress for doctors is composed by:\n* A black long gown (''toga'') with a long row of buttons, made of satin and wool. It is worn over a black suit.\n* A [[mozzetta]] (''muceta''), whose colour depends on the academic field.\n* Long cuffs (''pu\u00f1etas'') of the same fabric and color than the mozetta, covered by white cotton lace. Those of the ''Rector'' (University president) are bright red or pink, and the lace is usually silken. The buttons are made of gold for the Rector and made of silver for the Deans.\n* An octagonal, tasseled [[biretta]] (''birrete''), whose colour depends on the academic field. Tassels of doctors holding more than one degree in separate fields alternate the corresponding colors.\n* White gloves.\n* A ring is usually worn by doctors.\n* A staff or scepter (''bast\u00f3n'') made of American reed is carried by the University rector.\n* Medallions are often worn by postgraduates, doctors, professors, deans and the University rector.\n[[File:Birrete doctoral.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Doctorates wearing the Spanish doctor's academic dress with colours used for the various academic fields.]]\n[[File:Proc acade.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Academic procession at the [[Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University of Elche]].]]\nHowever, this academic dress is only used for the opening of the academic year and for PhD graduations or for doctorates ''[[honoris causa]]''. It is worn only by doctors, deans and the University Rector. For other graduates, the academic dress is often composed by a [[mortarboard]] and a mozzetta (''muceta'') or a sash over the shoulder (''beca'') with the shield of the University and/or Faculty. The colour of the mozzetta or the sash depends on the academic field.\n\nThe colours used in Spain for the various academic fields are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Academic field\n!Colour name\n!Sample\n|-\n|[[Psychology]]\n|[[Lilac]]\n| style=\"background:#c8a2c8;\"|\n|-\n|[[Pharmacy]]\n|[[Purple]]\n| style=\"background:#c54b8c;\"|\n|-\n|[[Odontology]]\n|[[Fuchsia (color)|Fuchsia]]\n| style=\"background:#ff34b3;\"|\n|-\n|[[Law]]\n|[[Red]]\n| style=\"background:#ff2400;\"|\n|-\n|[[Architecture]], [[Engineering]]\n|[[Brown]]\n| style=\"background:#964b00;\"|\n|-\n|[[Economics]], [[Business]], [[Political Sciences]], [[Sociology]]\n|[[Orange (colour)|Orange]]\n| style=\"background:#ff7f00;\"|\n|-\n|[[Medicine]]\n|[[Gold (color)|Gold]]\n| style=\"background:gold;\"|\n|-\n|[[Art]], [[Theology]]\n|[[White]]\n| style=\"background:white;\"|\n|-\n|[[Veterinary Medicine]]\n|[[Green]]\n| style=\"background:green;\"|\n|-\n|[[Sport Sciences]]\n|[[Light green]]\n| style=\"background:#7cfc00;\"|\n|-\n|[[Translation]], [[Interpreting]]\n|[[Teal]]\n| style=\"background:#20b2aa;\"|\n|-\n|[[Philosophy]], [[Literature]]\n|[[Sky blue]]\n| style=\"background:#add8e6;\"|\n|-\n|[[Learning Sciences]]\n|[[Light blue (color)|Light Blue]]\n| style=\"background:#00bfff;\"|\n|-\n|[[Natural Sciences]], Exact Sciences\n|[[Dark (\"Turk\") blue]]\n| style=\"background:#0000CD;\"|\n|-\n|[[Nursing]]\n|[[Grey]]\n| style=\"background:silver;\"|\n|-\n|[[Journalism]]\n|[[Lead grey]]\n| style=\"background:gray;\"|\n|-\n|[[Rector (academia)|Rector]]\n|[[Black]]\n| style=\"background:black;\"|\n|}\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn Sri Lanka, the academic dress consists of gown, hood (post-graduate) and a garland (on graduation day). Universities that were affiliated to the former [[University of Ceylon]] issue black gowns for graduates and post graduates; red gowns for masters and Phd graduates; crimson gowns for chancellors with a different colour gowns for senior academic faculty. These universities only issue [[garland]] on the graduation day to new graduates and only issue mortar boards to chancellor, vice chancellor and registrars. Private universities issue mortar boards to graduates along with a hood in place of garland.\n\n===Sweden and Finland===\n[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat from the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. (photograph taken on top of a mirror)]]\n[[File:Finnish doctoral hat.JPG|thumb|right|Finnish doctoral hat for a doctor of science from the [[University of Oulu]].]]\n\nFinland and Sweden have similar traditions when it comes to academic clothing. For important academic ceremonies [[white tie]] is usually worn, however, often with traditional headwear and gowns. Gowns are not generally used except by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] as a symbol of office, if anyone.\n\nThe regular [[student cap]] (Finnish: ''ylioppilaslakki'', Swedish: ''studentm\u00f6ssa'') usually has a white velvet crown, a black band and a black beak. The cap can be worn by anyone who has passed the [[matriculation examination]] and is acceptable wear for both formal and informal academic celebrations. Technology students wear a special kind of student cap called a ''teekkarilakki'' (Finnish) or ''teknologm\u00f6ssa'' (Swedish). It is similar to the traditional student cap, but features a tuft and a distinctive [[cockade]] to show which university the wearer is attending. Technology students generally wear their caps more frequently, and thus the tuft often symbolizes university engineering students. Although universities have different rules regarding the use of the cap, it is generally not awarded to the student until he or she has completed the first year of their studies. The technology student's hat may also be seen on informal occasions, being worn with the [[student overall]] at many universities.\n\nIn both countries many universities have [[doctoral hat]]s for persons who have completed a PhD or similar degree. These usually resemble [[top hats]] and must be worn with [[white tie]]. Like other hats, they are not generally worn indoors, but they may be presented on a table. Events where the hat and white tie are worn include thesis defences, post-doctoral parties, ceremonial conferments of degrees, opening ceremonies and other formal ceremonies related to the university.<ref>Sirkka Lassila, 1990. ''Uusi k\u00e4yt\u00f6ksen kultainen kirja''. Suuri Suomalainen Kirjakerho, Helsinki. Page 518.</ref> At some universities, a [[doctoral ring]] is awarded together with the hat. In the [[Ingmar Bergman]] film ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', one scene shows the conferral of a Jubilee doctor degree on the main character at the [[University of Lund]], which includes the presentation of such a hat and ring. At the [[University of Helsinki]] a cape and a sword are commonly worn with the doctoral hat. Students of the student organization \"Limes\" may also be seen wearing a black cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limes.fi/fi/jarjesto/tiedostot/cat_view/41-viralliset-asiat.html |title=Tiedostot &#124; Viralliset asiat |publisher=Limes.fi |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120914153957/http://www.limes.fi/fi/jarjesto/tiedostot/cat_view/41-viralliset-asiat.html |archivedate=14 September 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Thailand===\nAcademic dress used by universities in Thailand follow two traditions. Some universities use a traditional robe of the Siamese Court known as ''[[suea khrui]]'', ([[Chulalongkorn University]], the country's first university, is in this group), while others follow Western styles. Even among the Thai universities which choose to follow the Western traditions, there are those with \"American-style\" academic gowns, and also at least one university ([[Thammasat University]], the second-oldest university of Thailand), which prefers the \"French-style\" gown (completed with the \u00e9pitoge (epitoga) over the shoulder) instead.\n\n===Tunisia===\nIn [[Tunisia]], [[University of Ez-Zitouna]] graduates wear an academic gown. Doctoral graduates in Islamic Sciences wear a jebba.\n<br>\nIn other Tunisian universities, Like the Medicine university, Doctoral graduates wear an academic dress.\n[[File:Jebba.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Tunisian Jebba.]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n{{details|Academic dress in the United Kingdom}}{{see also|Academic dress of the University of Dublin|Academic dress of the National University of Ireland}}\n\n[[File:OU-graduate.jpg|right|thumb|An alternative coloured gown, [[The Open University]], MEd.]]\n[[File:Bishop Andrewes cap.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The Bishop Andrewes cap as used for [[University of Cambridge]] [[Doctor of Divinity|DDs]].]]\n\nThere is a distinction between different types of academical dress. Most recently, gowns, hoods and caps are categorised into their shape and patterns by the [[Groves classification system]], which is based on Nicholas Groves' document, ''Hood and Gown Patterns''.<ref>The Burgon Society: [http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php The Design of Academical Dress] (6 May 2007) Classification of Styles</ref> This lists the various styles or patterns of academic dress and assigns them a code or a [[Groves Classification Number]]. For example, the Cambridge BA style gown is designated [b2] and a hood in the Cambridge full-shape is designated [f1], etc. Because the universities are free to design their own academicals using a wide range of available gown, hood and cap patterns, colours and materials at their and the robemaker's disposal, the academicals of two given universities rarely clash with each other.\n\nThe [[Burgon Society]] was founded in 2000 to promote the study of academic dress.<ref>[http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/index.php Burgon Society: Introduction] (2 November 2008)</ref> Its publications and activities examine the history and current use of academic dress and in 2011 it published the third edition of Shaw's reference book on British and Irish academical dress.<ref>Groves, Nicholas. \"Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland\", London: Burgon Society, 2011.</ref> The Society hosts a conference each spring at which recent research is presented.<ref>\"Meeting of the Burgon Society.\" http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/meetings.php</ref>\n\nThe modern gown is derived from the ''roba'' worn under the ''cappa clausa'', a garment resembling a long black cape. In early medieval times, all students at the universities were in at least [[minor orders]], and were required to wear the ''cappa'' or other clerical dress, and restricted to clothes of black or other dark colour. The gowns most commonly worn, that of the clerical type gowns of [[Bachelor's degree]]s (BA and BS) and [[Master's degree]]s (MA and MS), are substantially the same throughout the English-speaking world. All are traditionally made of black cloth, (although occasionally the gown is dyed in one of the university's colours) and the material at the back of the gown is gathered into a yoke. The Bachelor's gown has bell-shaped sleeves, while the Master's gown has long sleeves closed at the end, with the arm passing through a slit above the elbow.<ref name=\"Shaw4-7\">Shaw (1995); pp. 4\u20137</ref>\n\nThere are two distinctive shapes used in the UK for doctor's gowns; the Oxford doctor's shape and the Cambridge doctor's shape. The former has bell-shaped sleeves, the latter has long open sleeves. Another rarer form is the Cambridge Doctor of Music dress gown which is a pattern between the two. The other form of doctor's gown is the undress gown. This is a black gown worn for less formal occasions such as lectures. This type of gown is rarely seen or worn nowadays as many wear the dress gown instead; however, the undress gown still plays a part in the older universities where academic dress is usually worn.\n\nUndergraduates at many older universities also wear gowns;<ref>Hargreaves-Mawdsley, pp. 91\u2013101, 128\u2013135, 146, 148\u2013149</ref> the most common essentially a smaller knee-length version of the Bachelor's gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is a sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherdandwoodward.co.uk/acatalog/Oxford_University_Student_Gowns.html |title=Shepherd & Woodward: Oxford University student gowns |publisher=Shepherdandwoodward.co.uk |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucags/spotter.htm |title=CU Cap & Gown Society: Gown-spotter's guide |publisher=Srcf.ucam.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305071759/http://www.srcf.ucam.org/cucags/spotter.htm |archivedate=5 March 2009  }}</ref> Undergraduates at St Andrews, with the exception of theology students, commonly wear scarlet woollen gowns with velvet collars.<ref>http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/staff/resourcesfornewstaff/universityintroduction/studentsatstandrews/universityofstandrewstraditions/traditionalredgowns/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities.\n\nAnother form of dress, now rarely seen, is the habit, which is worn over a black gown. Only Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Newcastle use habits and mainly reserve their use for very formal ceremonial occasions and to a specific group of academics or officials.\n\nThe hood was originally a functional garment, worn to shield the head from the elements. In the English tradition, it has developed to an often bright and decorative garment worn only on special occasions. Hoods comprise two basic patterns: full shape or simple shape. The traditional full-shape hood consists of a cape, [[cowl]], and [[liripipe]], as is used at Cambridge. At Oxford, the bachelors' and masters' hoods use simple hoods that have lost their cape and retain only the cowl and liripipe.<ref>''Burgon Annual 2003'' (2004); pp. 18\u201323</ref> The colour and [[lining (sewing)|lining]] of hoods in academic dress represents the rank and/or faculty of the wearer.<ref>Groves (2008), ''Hood Key''</ref> In many Commonwealth universities bachelors wear hoods edged or lined with white rabbit fur, while masters wear hoods lined with coloured silk (originally ermine or other expensive fur). Doctors' hoods are normally made of scarlet cloth and lined with coloured silk.<ref>Shaw (1995); p. 8</ref> Faculty colours were introduced by the University of London and many universities followed suit.<ref>''Burgon Transactions'' vol. 5 (2006); pp. 80\u201389</ref>\n\nThe [[academic cap]] or square, commonly known as the mortarboard, has come to be symbolic of academia. In some universities it can be worn by graduates and undergraduates alike. It is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top centre of the board. The mortarboard may also be referred to as a [[trencher cap]] (or simply trencher). The [[tassel]] is composed of a cluster of silk threads which are wrapped together with a cord which is attached to the button affixed to the centre of the headpiece. The loose strands are allowed to fall freely over the board edge, typically falling over the left front side of the cap. Often the strands are [[Braid|plaited]] together to form a cord with the end threads left untied. In many universities, holders of doctorates wear a soft-crowned, round-brimmed headpiece known as a [[Tudor bonnet]] or [[tam (cap)|tam]], rather than a trencher. Other types of hats used, especially in some universities in the UK, are the [[John Knox cap]] (mostly at Scottish universities), the [[Bishop Andrewes cap]] (a reinvention of the ancient form of the mortarboard, worn by Cambridge [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]] DD's) and the [[Pileus (hat)#University of Sussex pileus|pileus]] (at Sussex). In some universities, such as Oxford, women may wear an Oxford ladies' cap.<ref>Goff; pp.22\u201323</ref>\n\nOfficers of the universities generally wear distinctive and more elaborate dress. The [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] and the [[Vice-Chancellor]] may wear a black damask lay type gown (sometimes with a long train) trimmed with gold or silver [[lace]] and [[frog (fastening)|frogs]]. They wear a velvet mortarboard, similarly trimmed with gold braid and tassel. Other than this gown, they may have other distinct forms of dress, such as the scarlet ''cappa clausa'' or [[cope]] worn in certain circumstances by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge or his/her deputy and by higher doctors presenting candidates for degrees, which was once worn by [[Doctor of Divinity|Doctors of Divinity]].<ref>Shaw (1966); pp. 94\u201395</ref> In the past, Chancellors may also wear full court dress with breeches and court shoes like that of the [[Lord Chancellor]] of Great Britain.\n\nAt degree ceremonies, graduands often dress in the academic dress of the degree they are about to be admitted to prior to the actual graduation ceremony. This is not the case at several of the older universities in the UK, most notably, Oxford, Cambridge and St Andrews which have their own distinct traditions.\n\nIn addition to universities and colleges, a number of British professional bodies, such as the [[Institute of Biology]] and the [[Institute of Physics]] grant academic dress to their members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/practice/regs/other.php|title=Regulations for other Institutions and Societies|publisher=[[Burgon Society]]|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Academic regalia in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Harvard University Doctoral Gown and Hood.jpg|thumb|right|The Harvard doctoral gown and hood, which do not entirely follow the American Council on Education system.]]\n[[File:phdposing.png|thumb|right|Professors and newly conferred doctors of philosophy posing at a [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] graduation.]]\n[[File:Jacob1207b.JPG|thumb|right|150px|American academic dress is typically closed at the front and properly worn with the prescribed cap, as well as the hood.

There is an Inter-Collegiate code which sets out a detailed uniform scheme of academic regalia followed by most, though some institutions do not adhere to it entirely, and fewer still ignore it.\n\nThe practice of wearing academic regalia in the United States dates to the [[Colonial Colleges]] period, and was heavily influenced by European practices and styles.<ref name=overview>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Historical Overview''</ref> Students of most colonial colleges were required to wear the \"college habit\" at most times \u2013 a practice that lasted until the eve of the [[American Civil War]] in many institutions of higher learning.<ref name=RegaliaOfPrinceton>Smagorinsky. ''The Regalia of Princeton University: Pomp, Circumstance, and Accoutrements of Academia''.

In 1893, an Intercollegiate Commission made up of representatives from leading institutions was created, to establish an acceptable system of academic dress. The Commission met at Columbia College (now [[Columbia University]]) in 1895 and adopted a code of academic regalia, which prescribed the cut and style and materials of the gowns, as well as determined the colours which were to represent the different fields of learning.<ref>New York Times. \"Gowns for College Men; Academic Costumes in American Universities (1896):\nPlan to Secure a Uniform Practice in the Use of the Caps and Gowns in This Country So that the Degree of the Wearer, the Faculty Under Whom It Was Obtained, and the Institution Conferring It May Be Readily Seen.\" Sunday, 26 April 1896.</ref> In 1932 the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) authorized the appointment of a committee to determine whether revision and completion of the academic code adopted by the conference of the colleges and universities in 1895 is desirable at this time, and, if so, to draft a revised code and present a plan for submitting the code to the consideration of the institutional members of the council.\n\nThe committee reviewed the situation and approved a code for academic costumes that has been in effect since that year. A ''Committee on Academic Costumes and Ceremonies'', appointed by the American Council on Education in 1959, again reviewed the academic dress code and made several changes.<ref name=overview />\n\nAlthough academic dress is now rarely worn outside [[Graduation|commencement]] ceremonies or other academic rituals such as [[encaenia]] in the U.S. graduation ceremonies have gained popularity and have expanded from high school graduations to middle school, elementary school and kindergarten graduation ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhymeuniversity.com |title=Kindergarten graduation in the United States |publisher=Rhymeuniversity.com |accessdate=28 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510095619/http://rhymeuniversity.com/| archivedate= 10 May 2010| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n[[Bachelor's degree|Bachelors']] and [[Master's degree|masters']] gowns in the United States are similar to their counterparts in the United Kingdom, though bachelor's gowns are now designed to be worn closed, and all are at least mid-calf length to ankle-length.<ref name=SullivanGowns>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Gowns''</ref> The masters' gown sleeve is [[rectangle|oblong]] and, though the base of the sleeve hangs down in the typical manner, it is square cut at the rear part of the oblong shape. The front part has an arc cut away, and there is a slit for the wrist opening, but the rest of the arc is closed. The shape is evocative of the square-cut [[liripipe]] incorporated into many academic hoods (''see'', below). The master's gown is designed to be worn open or closed.<ref name=SullivanGowns />\n\n[[Doctorate|Doctoral]] robes are typically black, although some schools use robes in the [[school colors|school's colours]].<ref name=SullivanGowns /> The Code calls for the outside shell of the hood (''see'', below) to remain black in that case, however. In general, doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by bachelor's graduates, with the addition of three velvet bands on the sleeves and velvet facing running down the front of the gown. The Code calls for the gown trim to be either black or the colour designated for the field of study in which the doctorate was earned (see ''[[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]''). However, in the case of the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD), although it is awarded for study in any number of fields, the dark blue velvet of philosophy is always used regardless of the particular field studied. For example, if not choosing black trim, a PhD in theology would wear velvet gown trim in dark blue, while a [[Doctor of Theology]] (Th.D.) would wear scarlet trim, if not choosing black. The robes have full sleeves, instead of the bell sleeves of the bachelor's gown. Some gowns expose a [[necktie]] or [[cravat]] when closed, while others take an almost cape-like form. It is designed to be worn open or closed in the front.<ref name=SullivanGowns />\n\nThe Code calls for the shell material of the hood to match the robe, and for the colour to be black regardless of the colour of the robe being worn.<ref name=SullivanHoods>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods''</ref> The interior lining \u2013 generally silk \u2013 displays the colours of the institution from which the wearer received the degree, in a pattern prescribed by it (usually, if more than one colour is used, [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] or equal divisions).<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods'';''Linings''</ref> The opening of the hood is [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] in [[velvet]] or [[velveteen]].<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Hoods''; ''Trimmings''</ref> In most American colleges and universities, the colour of the velvet hood trimming is distinctive of the academic field \u2013 or as closely related as possible \u2013 to which the degree earned pertains (see ''[[Academic regalia in the United States#Intercollegiate colors|Inter-Collegiate colors]]'').<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Additional Guidance on Costume''</ref> Many institutions, particularly larger ones, have dispensed with the bachelor's hood at commencement ceremonies altogether, though a graduate is still entitled to wear one once the degree is conferred.<ref name=SullivanExceptions>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Some Permissible Exceptions''</ref>\n\nHeadwear is an important component of cap-and-gown, and the academic costume is not complete without it. The headwear will vary with the level of academic achievement and, to some extent, on the individual academic institution's specifications. For caps, the mortarboard is recommended in the Code, and the material required to match the gown.<ref name=SullivanCaps>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Caps''</ref> The exception\u2014velvet\u2014is reserved for the doctor's degree only, seen in the form of a multiple-sided (4, 6, or 8) [[tam (cap)|tam]], but the four-sided mortarboard-shaped tam in velvet is what the Code seems to recommend here.<ref name=SullivanCaps /> The only colour called for is black, in all cases.<ref name=SullivanCaps /> The tassel worn on the mortarboard or a tam seems to provide, by tradition, the greatest opportunity for latitude in American academic dress. It has been black, or represented the university's colours, or the colours of the specific college, or the discipline. The tassel has also been used to indicate membership in national [[honor society|honour societies]] or other awards. There is at some colleges and universities a practice of moving the tassel from one side to the other on graduating, but this is a modern innovation that would be impractical out of doors due to the vagaries of the wind. For doctoral and masters students, the tassel commonly begins and remains on the left.<ref name=SullivanWearing>Sullivan. The Academic Costume Code, ''Wearing the Costume''</ref>\n\nThe colours allocated to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume, and accepted by the American Council on Education in its ''Academic Costume Code.''<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsGowns /> Some of the more common colours seen are that [[liberal arts]] is represented by white, science by golden yellow, medicine by green, law by purple, theology by scarlet, and philosophy (including all PhD degrees) by dark blue. A distinction is made in the code, which calls for a graduate to display the colour of the subject of the degree obtained, not the degree itself.<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/> For example, if a graduate is awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) degree specifically in business the trimming should be drab, representing commerce/accountancy/business, rather than white, representing the broader arts/letters/humanities; the same method is true of master's degrees and doctorates. However, in 1986, the American Council on Education updated the Code and added the following sentence clarifying the use of the colour dark blue for the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, which is awarded in any number of fields: \"In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree, the dark blue colour is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field that is attested to by the awarding of the degree, and it is not intended to represent the field of philosophy.\"<ref name=SullivanTrimmingsHoods/>\n\nA number of other items such as [[honor cords|cords]], [[academic stole|stoles]], [[aiguillette]]s, etc. representing various academic achievements or other honours are also worn at the discretion of some degree-granting institutions. Technically, however, the ACE code does not allow their use on or over academic regalia.\n\n==Pontifical universities==\nAcademic dress for [[Pontifical university|pontifical universities]] tends to vary by the host country. Traditionally, for doctors of a pontifical university or faculty \"the principal mark of a Doctor's dignity is the four horned biretta.\"<ref>John Abel Nainfa, Costume of Prelates of The Catholic Church: According To Roman Etiquette, 164.</ref> under the [[1917 Code of Canon Law|old Code of Canon Law]], in [[commencement ceremony|commencement ceremonies]] and other academic settings, doctors from pontifical faculties and universities had a canonical right to wear the doctoral biretta, as stated in can. 1378, and explained in commentary 262 of the Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici as follows:\n{{quote|262. Doctoratus ac Scentiae effectus canonici sic recensentur can. 1378...doctoribus seu gradum academicum in una ex quatuor supradictis facultatibus <<vide 261: philosophia, theologia, ius canonicum, Sacra Scriptura>> supremum obtinentibus, rite creatis, seu promotis regulariter post examen, iuxta \u00ab statuta a Sede Apostolica probata \u00bb (can. 1376, \u00a7 2) saltem quoad usum validum \u00ab facultatis ab eadem Aplca.

XXII, 262</ref>}}\n\nThere is no equivalent canon in the current [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated in 1983, but the tradition remains.\n\nThe Sartoria Gammerelli {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}} offers, in line with the updated stipulations of the Pontifical Gregorian University, birettas lined with the following assorted piping and tufts depending on which faculty one is graduated from: Green for Canon Law, Red for Sacred Theology, Blue for Philosophy, and Orange for Social Sciences. Three-horned birettas are to be used by Licentiates, four-horned for Doctors.\n\nAcademic dress for the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] graduates consists of a black toga or academic gown with trim to follow the color of the faculty, and an academic ring. For the doctoral degree a four corned [[biretta]] is to be worn, and for the Licentiate degree a three corned [[biretta]] is to be worn.

As such, USB devices often do not have user-adjustable interface settings.\n* The USB interface is [[Hot swapping|hot-swappable]] (devices can be exchanged without rebooting the host computer). \n* Small devices can be powered directly from the USB interface, eliminating the need for additional power supply cables.\n* Because use of the USB logo is only permitted after [[Conformance testing|compliance testing]], the user can have confidence that a USB device will work as expected without extensive interaction with settings and configuration.\n* The USB interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors, improving reliability over previous interfaces.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* Installation of a device relying on the USB standard requires minimal operator action. When a device is plugged into a port on a running personal computer system, it is either entirely automatically configured using existing [[Device driver|device drivers]], or the system prompts the user to locate a driver which is then installed and configured automatically.\n\nThe USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers, specifically in the relative ease of implementation:\n* The USB standard eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to new peripherals. \n* The wide range of transfer speeds available from a USB interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces. \n* A USB interface can be designed to provide the best available [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for time-critical functions, or can be set up to do background transfers of bulk data with little impact on system resources. \n* The USB interface is generalized with no signal lines dedicated to only one function of one device.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n===Limitations===\nAs with all standards, USB possesses multiple limitations to its design:\n* USB cables are limited in length, as the standard was intended for peripherals on the same table-top, not between rooms or buildings. However, a USB port can be connected to a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] that accesses distant devices. \n* USB has a strict [[tree network]] topology and [[Master/slave (technology)|master/slave]] protocol for addressing peripheral devices; those devices cannot interact with one another except via the host, and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports directly. Some extension to this limitation is possible through [[USB On-The-Go]]. \n* A host cannot broadcast signals to all peripherals at once\u2014each must be addressed individually. Some very high speed peripheral devices require sustained speeds not available in the USB standard.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* While converters exist between certain [[Legacy system|legacy interfaces]] and USB, they may not provide full implementation of the legacy hardware. For example, a USB-to-parallel-port converter may work well with a printer, but not with a scanner that requires bi-directional use of the data pins.\n\nFor a product developer, use of USB requires implementation of a complex protocol and implies an \"intelligent\" controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID which requires a fee paid to the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the Implementers Forum. Use of the USB logos on the product require annual fees and membership in the organization.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:USB Icon.svg|thumb|right|alt=Large circle is left end of horizontal line.

Additional [[USB hub]]s may be included, allowing up to five tiers. A USB host may have multiple controllers, each with one or more ports. Up to 127 devices may be connected to a single host controller.<ref>{{cite book | title = Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0 | pages = 13; 30; 256 | format = [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | date = 11 October 2011 | accessdate = 2012-09-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120528075527/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | archivedate = 28 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"spec_3.0\" />{{rp|at=8\u201329}} USB devices are linked in series through hubs. The hub built into the host controller is called the ''root hub''.\n\nA USB device may consist of several logical sub-devices that are referred to as ''device functions''. A ''composite device'' may provide several functions, for example, a [[webcam]] (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). An alternative to this is a ''[[compound device]],'' in which the host assigns each logical device a distinct address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.\n\n[[File:USB pipes and endpoints (en).svg|thumb|alt=Diagram: inside a device are several endpoints, each of which is connected by a logical pipes to a host controller. Data in each pipe flows in one direction, although there are a mixture going to and from the host controller.|USB endpoints reside on the connected device: the channels to the host are referred to as pipes]]\n\nUSB device communication is based on ''pipes'' (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity within a device, called an ''[[communication endpoint|endpoint]]''. Because pipes correspond to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Each USB device can have up to 32 endpoints (16 ''in'' and 16 ''out''), though it is rare to have so many. Endpoints are defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called \"enumeration\") and so are relatively permanent, whereas pipes may be opened and closed.\n\nThere are two types of pipe: stream and message.\n* A ''message'' pipe is bi-directional and is used for ''control'' transfers. Message pipes are typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and for status responses from the device, used, for example, by the bus control pipe number 0.\n* A ''stream'' pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a uni-directional endpoint that transfers data using an ''isochronous'',<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |title       = Isochronous Protocol\n |date        = 2009-05-20\n |accessdate  = 2014-11-21\n |author      = Dan Froelich\n |website     = usb.org\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140817061140/http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |archivedate = 17 August 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> ''interrupt'', or ''bulk'' transfer:\n*;Isochronous transfers: At some guaranteed data rate (for fixed-bandwidth streaming data) but with possible data loss (e.g., realtime audio or video)\n*;Interrupt transfers: Devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency) such as pointing devices, [[Computer mouse|mice]], and keyboards\n*;Bulk transfers: Large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth, but with no guarantees on bandwidth or latency (e.g., file transfers)\n\nWhen a host starts a data transfer, it sends a TOKEN packet containing an endpoint specified with a [[tuple]] of ''(device_address, endpoint_number)''. If the transfer is from the host to the endpoint, the host sends an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) with the desired device address and endpoint number. If the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.\n\n[[File:USB 2 and 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Rectangular opening where the width is twice the height. The opening has a metal rim, and within the opening a flat rectangular bar runs parallel to the top side.|Two USB&nbsp;3.0 Standard-A receptacles (left) and two USB&nbsp;2.0 Standard-A receptacles (right) on a computer's front panel]]\n\nEndpoints are grouped into ''interfaces'' and each interface is associated with a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a ''composite device''. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.\n\nWhen a USB device is first connected to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device is supported by the host, the [[device driver]]s needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.\n\nThe host controller directs traffic flow to devices, so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB&nbsp;2.0, the host controller [[Polling (computer science)|polls]] the bus for traffic, usually in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. The throughput of each USB port is determined by the slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port.\n\nHigh-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 buses and full and low speed buses. There may be one translator per hub or per port.\n\nBecause there are two separate controllers in each USB&nbsp;3.0 host, USB&nbsp;3.0 devices transmit and receive at USB&nbsp;3.0 data rates regardless of USB&nbsp;2.0 or earlier devices connected to that host. Operating data rates for earlier devices are set in the legacy manner.\n\n== {{Anchor|PHDC}}Device classes ==\nThe functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent to a USB host. This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.\n\nDevice classes include:<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | title = USB Class Codes | date = 22 September 2018 | via=www.usb.org | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180922111633/https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | archivedate = 22 September 2018 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At first intended for magnetic and optical drives, it has been extended to support [[USB flash drive|flash drives]]. It has also been extended to support a wide variety of novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked [[SD card]] with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.\n\nThough most personal computers since early 2005 can boot from USB mass storage devices, USB is not intended as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. However, USB has the advantage of allowing [[hot-swapping]], making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds.\n\nSeveral manufacturers offer external portable USB [[hard disk drive]]s, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, limited by the current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include [[eSATA]], [[ExpressCard]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE 1394), and most recently [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]].\n\nAnother use for USB mass storage devices is the portable execution of software applications (such as web browsers and VoIP clients) with no need to install them on the host computer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | title = 100 Portable Apps for your USB Stick (both for Mac and Win) | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121455/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | archivedate = 2 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.VoIP-Download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | title = Skype VoIP USB Installation Guide | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140706153501/http://www.voip-download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | archivedate = 6 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Media Transfer Protocol ===\n{{See also|Picture Transfer Protocol}}\n[[Media Transfer Protocol]] (MTP) was designed by [[Microsoft]] to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] features. MTP was designed for use with [[portable media player]]s, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol{{snd}} an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.\n\n=== Human interface devices ===\n{{Main |USB human interface device class}}\nJoysticks, keypads, tablets and other human-interface devices (HIDs) are also progressively{{when|date=February 2016}} migrating from MIDI, and PC [[game port]] connectors to USB.{{Citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nUSB mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have [[PS/2 port|PS/2 connectors]] with the aid of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no [[Electronic circuit|logic circuitry]] may be used: the [[USB hardware]] in the keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB | title = PS/2 to USB Keyboard and Mouse Adapter | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112214808/http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB |website=StarTech.com | archivedate = 12 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a [[microcontroller]] to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.\n\n=== {{Anchor|DFU}}Device Firmware Upgrade ===\n''Device Firmware Upgrade'' (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent mechanism for upgrading the [[firmware]] of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) a way to deploy firmware bug fixes. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] programmer.

This is one of many types of [[USB connector]].]]\nBy design, it is difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation.<ref name=\"spec_3.0\" /> The USB-C plug however is reversible. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as some connectors use.\n\nThe different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as [[USB On-The-Go]] in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables.\n\nUSB connector types multiplied as the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made.  Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections, but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end, otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.\n\n== {{Anchor|CABLING}}Cabling ==\n[[File:Cables in Hong Kong.JPG|thumb|right|A variety of USB cables for sale in [[Hong Kong]]]]\n{{Main|USB hardware#Cabling}}  \n \nThe USB&nbsp;1.1 standard specifies that a standard cable can have a maximum length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at full speed (12&nbsp;Mbit/s), and a maximum length of {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at low speed (1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |title=USB Cable Length Limitations |publisher=cablesplususa.com |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2014-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015850/http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |title=What is the Maximum Length of a USB Cable? |publisher=Techwalla.com |accessdate=2017-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043247/https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |archivedate=1 December 2017  }}</ref><ref name=\"faq\"/>\n\nUSB&nbsp;2.0 provides for a maximum cable length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} for devices running at high speed (480&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref name=\"faq\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | title = Cables and Long-Haul Solutions | work = USB 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = USB Implementers Forum | accessdate = 2019-04-28 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110118225750/http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | archivedate = 18 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe USB&nbsp;3.0 standard does not directly specify a maximum cable length, requiring only that all cables meet an electrical specification: for copper cabling with [[American wire gauge|AWG]]&nbsp;26 wires the maximum practical length is {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=USB 3.0 Developers FAQ |url=http://janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |accessdate=2016-10-20 |last=Axelson |first=Jan |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073858/http://www.janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor|POWER}}Power ==\n{{Main|USB hardware#Power}}\n\nUSB supplies power at 5&nbsp;V&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;5% to power USB downstream devices.\n\n=== {{Anchor|HOST}}Low-power and high-power devices ===\nLow-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load (1 unit load is 100 mA for USB devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0, while USB&nbsp;3.0 defines a unit load as 150&nbsp;mA), and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured.\n\nHigh-power devices (such as a typical 2.5-inch USB hard disc drive) draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (5x100mA = 500&nbsp;mA) for devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0 or 6 unit loads (6x150mA= 900&nbsp;mA) for SuperSpeed (USB 3.0 and up) devices.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ USB power standards\n|-\n!

In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.\n\nThe most significant technical differences between FireWire and USB include:\n\n* USB networks use a [[star network|tiered-star]] topology, while IEEE&nbsp;1394 networks use a [[tree network|tree]] topology.\n* USB&nbsp;1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a \"speak-when-spoken-to\" protocol, meaning that each peripheral communicates with the host when the host specifically requests it to communicate. USB&nbsp;3.0 allows for device-initiated communications towards the host. A FireWire device can communicate with any other node at any time, subject to network conditions.\n* A USB network relies on a single host at the top of the tree to control the network. All communications are between the host and one peripheral. In a FireWire network, any capable node can control the network.\n* USB runs with a 5&nbsp;[[Volts|V]] power line, while FireWire in current implementations supplies 12&nbsp;V and theoretically can supply up to 30&nbsp;V.\n* Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical 500&nbsp;mA/2.5&nbsp;W of current, only 100&nbsp;mA from non-hub ports. USB&nbsp;3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8&nbsp;A/9.0&nbsp;W (for dedicated battery charging, 1.5&nbsp;A/7.5&nbsp;W full bandwidth or 900&nbsp;mA/4.5&nbsp;W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60&nbsp;watts of power, although 10 to 20&nbsp;watts is more typical.\n\nThese and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire&nbsp;400 is faster than USB&nbsp;2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use,<ref>{{cite web|title=FireWire vs. USB 2.0|url=http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|publisher=QImaging|accessdate=2010-07-20|format=PDF|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011050049/http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2010}}</ref> especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |title= FireWire vs. USB&nbsp;2.0 \u2013 Bandwidth Tests |accessdate= 2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070812045719/http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |archivedate= 12 August 2007 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |title=USB&nbsp;2.0 vs FireWire |publisher=Pricenfees |accessdate=2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016063120/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |archivedate=16 October 2016  }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,847716,00.asp |title=The Great Interface-Off: FireWire Vs.

They operate at 48&nbsp;V&nbsp;[[Direct current|DC]] and can supply more power (up to 12.95&nbsp;W for ''af'', 25.5&nbsp;W for ''at'' aka ''PoE+'', 71&nbsp;W for ''bt'' aka ''4PPoE'') over a cable up to 100&nbsp;meters compared to USB&nbsp;2.0, which provides 2.5&nbsp;W with a maximum cable length of 5&nbsp;meters. This has made PoE popular for [[VoIP]] telephones, [[security camera]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.\n\n[[Ethernet]] standards require electrical isolation between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) and the network cable up to 1500&nbsp;V&nbsp;AC or 2250&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC for 60&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | title = 802.3, Section 14.3.1.1 | format = PDF | publisher = IEEE | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206030247/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | archivedate = 6 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds.

However, Power over Ethernet and the [[MIDI]] plug standard have an advantage in high-end devices that may have long cables. USB can cause [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems between equipment, because it connects ground references on both transceivers. By contrast, the MIDI plug standard and [[Ethernet]] have built-in isolation to {{gaps|500|V}} or more.\n\n=== eSATA/eSATAp ===\nThe [[eSATA]] connector is a more robust [[SATA]] connector, intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA's transfer rate (up to 6&nbsp;Gbit/s) is similar to that of USB&nbsp;3.0 (up to 5&nbsp;Gbit/s on current devices; 10&nbsp;Gbit/s speeds via USB&nbsp;3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.\n\neSATA does not supply power to external devices. This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB. Even though USB&nbsp;3.0's 4.5&nbsp;W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage. [[eSATAp]] (power over eSATA; aka ESATA/USB) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power to attached devices using a new, backward compatible, connector. On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5&nbsp;V to power a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12&nbsp;V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD/SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives.\n\neSATAp support can be added to a desktop machine in the form of a bracket connecting the motherboard SATA, power, and USB resources.\n\neSATA, like USB, supports [[hot plugging]], although this might be limited by OS drivers and device firmware.\n\n=== Thunderbolt ===\n[[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] combines [[PCI Express]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]] into a new serial data interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10&nbsp;Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |title=How Thunderbolt Technology Works: Thunderbolt Technology Community |publisher=Thunderbolttechnology.net |accessdate=2014-01-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210063142/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archivedate=10 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n[[Thunderbolt 2]] uses link aggregation to combine the two 10&nbsp;Gbit/s channels into one bidirectional 20&nbsp;Gbit/s channel.\n\n[[Thunderbolt 3]] uses the [[USB-C]] connector.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|title=One port to rule them all: Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 and USB Type-C join forces|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602195337/http://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|archivedate=2015-06-02|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 is twice as fast and uses reversible USB-C |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603000428/http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |archivedate=2015-06-03  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 embraces USB Type-C connector, doubles bandwidth to 40&nbsp;Gbps |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=2015-06-02|website=Ars Technica |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609183247/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |archivedate=2015-06-09  }}</ref> Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 has two physical 20&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channels, aggregated to appear as a single logical 40&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channel. Thunderbolt 3 controllers can incorporate a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 controller to provide compatibility with USB devices. They are also capable of providing DisplayPort alternate mode over the USB-C connector, making a Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 port a superset of a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort alternate mode.\n\nAfter the specification was made royalty-free and custodianship of the Thunderbolt protocol was transferred from Intel to the USB Implementers' Forum, Thunderbolt 3 has been effectively implemented in the USB4 specification \u2013 with compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 optional but encouraged for USB4 products \u2014 with Thunderbolt 4 being applied to products that are compatible with USB4's complete feature set. \n\n== Interoperability ==\n{{Main|USB adapter}}\nVarious [[protocol converter]]s are available that convert USB data signals to and from other communications standards.\n\n== Security threats ==\n\n* [[BadUSB]]<ref name=BadUSB></ref>, see also [[USB flash drive#BadUSB]]\n* Intel cpus, from Skylake, allow to take control over them from USB 3.0.<ref>https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/where-theres-a-jtag-theres-a-way/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCUrG7ERIE</ref><ref>https://habr.com/ru/company/pt/blog/318744/</ref>\n* [[USB Killer]]\n* USB flash drives were dangerous for first versions of Windows XP because they were configured by default to execute program shown in Autorun.inf immediately after plugging flash drive in, malware could be automatically activated with usage of that.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[DockPort]]\n* [[Easy Transfer Cable]]\n* [[Extensible Host Controller Interface]] (XHCI)\n* [[LIO Target]]\n* [[List of device bit rates#Peripheral]]\n* [[Media Transfer Protocol]]\n* [[Mobile High-Definition Link]]\n* [[WebUSB]]\n* [[USB-C]]\n* [[Thunderbolt (interface)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist |refs=\n<ref name=\"spec_3.0\">{{cite book | url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | title=Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | date=6 June 2011 |via=www.usb.org | publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard Company]] [[Intel Corporation]] [[Microsoft Corporation]] [[NEC Corporation]] [[ST-Ericsson]] [[Texas Instruments]] | format=[[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519092924/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | archivedate=19 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}<br />{{cite web |title= Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | url= http://www.gaw.ru/pdf/interface/usb/USB%203%200_english.pdf |date= 2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2012-12-29 |via= www.gaw.ru | df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"usb.org 3.1\">{{cite web |title=USB 3.1 Specification{{snd}} Language Usage Guidelines from USB-IF |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |via=www.usb.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312135950/http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2016  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"xmos2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.epsglobal.com/downloads/XMOS/Why-do-you-need-USB-Audio-Class-2.pdf |title=Why do you need USB Audio Class 2? |last=Strong |first=Laurence |date=2015 |publisher=XMOS |quote=In applications where streaming latency is important, UAC2 offers up to an 8x reduction over UAC1. ...

It has largely replaced interfaces such as [[serial port]]s and [[parallel port]]s, and has become commonplace on a wide range of devices. Examples of peripherals that are connected via USB include computer keyboards and mice, video cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters.\n\nUSB connectors have been increasingly replacing other types as charging cables of portable devices.\n\n===Receptacle (socket) identification ===\n{{Main|USB hardware#Connectors}}\nThis section is intended to allow fast identification of USB receptacles (sockets) on equipment.

As such, USB devices often do not have user-adjustable interface settings.\n* The USB interface is [[Hot swapping|hot-swappable]] (devices can be exchanged without rebooting the host computer). \n* Small devices can be powered directly from the USB interface, eliminating the need for additional power supply cables.\n* Because use of the USB logo is only permitted after [[Conformance testing|compliance testing]], the user can have confidence that a USB device will work as expected without extensive interaction with settings and configuration.\n* The USB interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors, improving reliability over previous interfaces.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* Installation of a device relying on the USB standard requires minimal operator action. When a device is plugged into a port on a running personal computer system, it is either entirely automatically configured using existing [[Device driver|device drivers]], or the system prompts the user to locate a driver which is then installed and configured automatically.\n\nThe USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers, specifically in the relative ease of implementation:\n* The USB standard eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to new peripherals. \n* The wide range of transfer speeds available from a USB interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces. \n* A USB interface can be designed to provide the best available [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for time-critical functions, or can be set up to do background transfers of bulk data with little impact on system resources. \n* The USB interface is generalized with no signal lines dedicated to only one function of one device.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n===Limitations===\nAs with all standards, USB possesses multiple limitations to its design:\n* USB cables are limited in length, as the standard was intended for peripherals on the same table-top, not between rooms or buildings. However, a USB port can be connected to a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] that accesses distant devices. \n* USB has a strict [[tree network]] topology and [[Master/slave (technology)|master/slave]] protocol for addressing peripheral devices; those devices cannot interact with one another except via the host, and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports directly. Some extension to this limitation is possible through [[USB On-The-Go]]. \n* A host cannot broadcast signals to all peripherals at once\u2014each must be addressed individually. Some very high speed peripheral devices require sustained speeds not available in the USB standard.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* While converters exist between certain [[Legacy system|legacy interfaces]] and USB, they may not provide full implementation of the legacy hardware. For example, a USB-to-parallel-port converter may work well with a printer, but not with a scanner that requires bi-directional use of the data pins.\n\nFor a product developer, use of USB requires implementation of a complex protocol and implies an \"intelligent\" controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID which requires a fee paid to the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the Implementers Forum. Use of the USB logos on the product require annual fees and membership in the organization.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:USB Icon.svg|thumb|right|alt=Large circle is left end of horizontal line.

Additional [[USB hub]]s may be included, allowing up to five tiers. A USB host may have multiple controllers, each with one or more ports. Up to 127 devices may be connected to a single host controller.<ref>{{cite book | title = Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0 | pages = 13; 30; 256 | format = [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | date = 11 October 2011 | accessdate = 2012-09-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120528075527/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | archivedate = 28 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"spec_3.0\" />{{rp|at=8\u201329}} USB devices are linked in series through hubs. The hub built into the host controller is called the ''root hub''.\n\nA USB device may consist of several logical sub-devices that are referred to as ''device functions''. A ''composite device'' may provide several functions, for example, a [[webcam]] (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). An alternative to this is a ''[[compound device]],'' in which the host assigns each logical device a distinct address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.\n\n[[File:USB pipes and endpoints (en).svg|thumb|alt=Diagram: inside a device are several endpoints, each of which is connected by a logical pipes to a host controller. Data in each pipe flows in one direction, although there are a mixture going to and from the host controller.|USB endpoints reside on the connected device: the channels to the host are referred to as pipes]]\n\nUSB device communication is based on ''pipes'' (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity within a device, called an ''[[communication endpoint|endpoint]]''. Because pipes correspond to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Each USB device can have up to 32 endpoints (16 ''in'' and 16 ''out''), though it is rare to have so many. Endpoints are defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called \"enumeration\") and so are relatively permanent, whereas pipes may be opened and closed.\n\nThere are two types of pipe: stream and message.\n* A ''message'' pipe is bi-directional and is used for ''control'' transfers. Message pipes are typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and for status responses from the device, used, for example, by the bus control pipe number 0.\n* A ''stream'' pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a uni-directional endpoint that transfers data using an ''isochronous'',<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |title       = Isochronous Protocol\n |date        = 2009-05-20\n |accessdate  = 2014-11-21\n |author      = Dan Froelich\n |website     = usb.org\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140817061140/http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |archivedate = 17 August 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> ''interrupt'', or ''bulk'' transfer:\n*;Isochronous transfers: At some guaranteed data rate (for fixed-bandwidth streaming data) but with possible data loss (e.g., realtime audio or video)\n*;Interrupt transfers: Devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency) such as pointing devices, [[Computer mouse|mice]], and keyboards\n*;Bulk transfers: Large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth, but with no guarantees on bandwidth or latency (e.g., file transfers)\n\nWhen a host starts a data transfer, it sends a TOKEN packet containing an endpoint specified with a [[tuple]] of ''(device_address, endpoint_number)''. If the transfer is from the host to the endpoint, the host sends an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) with the desired device address and endpoint number. If the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.\n\n[[File:USB 2 and 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Rectangular opening where the width is twice the height. The opening has a metal rim, and within the opening a flat rectangular bar runs parallel to the top side.|Two USB&nbsp;3.0 Standard-A receptacles (left) and two USB&nbsp;2.0 Standard-A receptacles (right) on a computer's front panel]]\n\nEndpoints are grouped into ''interfaces'' and each interface is associated with a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a ''composite device''. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.\n\nWhen a USB device is first connected to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device is supported by the host, the [[device driver]]s needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.\n\nThe host controller directs traffic flow to devices, so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB&nbsp;2.0, the host controller [[Polling (computer science)|polls]] the bus for traffic, usually in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. The throughput of each USB port is determined by the slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port.\n\nHigh-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 buses and full and low speed buses. There may be one translator per hub or per port.\n\nBecause there are two separate controllers in each USB&nbsp;3.0 host, USB&nbsp;3.0 devices transmit and receive at USB&nbsp;3.0 data rates regardless of USB&nbsp;2.0 or earlier devices connected to that host. Operating data rates for earlier devices are set in the legacy manner.\n\n== {{Anchor|PHDC}}Device classes ==\nThe functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent to a USB host. This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.\n\nDevice classes include:<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | title = USB Class Codes | date = 22 September 2018 | via=www.usb.org | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180922111633/https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | archivedate = 22 September 2018 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At first intended for magnetic and optical drives, it has been extended to support [[USB flash drive|flash drives]]. It has also been extended to support a wide variety of novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked [[SD card]] with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.\n\nThough most personal computers since early 2005 can boot from USB mass storage devices, USB is not intended as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. However, USB has the advantage of allowing [[hot-swapping]], making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds.\n\nSeveral manufacturers offer external portable USB [[hard disk drive]]s, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, limited by the current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include [[eSATA]], [[ExpressCard]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE 1394), and most recently [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]].\n\nAnother use for USB mass storage devices is the portable execution of software applications (such as web browsers and VoIP clients) with no need to install them on the host computer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | title = 100 Portable Apps for your USB Stick (both for Mac and Win) | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121455/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | archivedate = 2 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.VoIP-Download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | title = Skype VoIP USB Installation Guide | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140706153501/http://www.voip-download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | archivedate = 6 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Media Transfer Protocol ===\n{{See also|Picture Transfer Protocol}}\n[[Media Transfer Protocol]] (MTP) was designed by [[Microsoft]] to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] features. MTP was designed for use with [[portable media player]]s, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol{{snd}} an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.\n\n=== Human interface devices ===\n{{Main |USB human interface device class}}\nJoysticks, keypads, tablets and other human-interface devices (HIDs) are also progressively{{when|date=February 2016}} migrating from MIDI, and PC [[game port]] connectors to USB.{{Citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nUSB mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have [[PS/2 port|PS/2 connectors]] with the aid of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no [[Electronic circuit|logic circuitry]] may be used: the [[USB hardware]] in the keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB | title = PS/2 to USB Keyboard and Mouse Adapter | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112214808/http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB |website=StarTech.com | archivedate = 12 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a [[microcontroller]] to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.\n\n=== {{Anchor|DFU}}Device Firmware Upgrade ===\n''Device Firmware Upgrade'' (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent mechanism for upgrading the [[firmware]] of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) a way to deploy firmware bug fixes. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] programmer.

This is one of many types of [[USB connector]].]]\nBy design, it is difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation.<ref name=\"spec_3.0\" /> The USB-C plug however is reversible. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as some connectors use.\n\nThe different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as [[USB On-The-Go]] in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables.\n\nUSB connector types multiplied as the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made.  Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections, but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end, otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.\n\n== {{Anchor|CABLING}}Cabling ==\n[[File:Cables in Hong Kong.JPG|thumb|right|A variety of USB cables for sale in [[Hong Kong]]]]\n{{Main|USB hardware#Cabling}}  \n \nThe USB&nbsp;1.1 standard specifies that a standard cable can have a maximum length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at full speed (12&nbsp;Mbit/s), and a maximum length of {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at low speed (1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |title=USB Cable Length Limitations |publisher=cablesplususa.com |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2014-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015850/http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |title=What is the Maximum Length of a USB Cable? |publisher=Techwalla.com |accessdate=2017-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043247/https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |archivedate=1 December 2017  }}</ref><ref name=\"faq\"/>\n\nUSB&nbsp;2.0 provides for a maximum cable length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} for devices running at high speed (480&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref name=\"faq\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | title = Cables and Long-Haul Solutions | work = USB 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = USB Implementers Forum | accessdate = 2019-04-28 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110118225750/http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | archivedate = 18 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe USB&nbsp;3.0 standard does not directly specify a maximum cable length, requiring only that all cables meet an electrical specification: for copper cabling with [[American wire gauge|AWG]]&nbsp;26 wires the maximum practical length is {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=USB 3.0 Developers FAQ |url=http://janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |accessdate=2016-10-20 |last=Axelson |first=Jan |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073858/http://www.janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor|POWER}}Power ==\n{{Main|USB hardware#Power}}\n\nUSB supplies power at 5&nbsp;V&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;5% to power USB downstream devices.\n\n=== {{Anchor|HOST}}Low-power and high-power devices ===\nLow-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load (1 unit load is 100 mA for USB devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0, while USB&nbsp;3.0 defines a unit load as 150&nbsp;mA), and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured.\n\nHigh-power devices (such as a typical 2.5-inch USB hard disc drive) draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (5x100mA = 500&nbsp;mA) for devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0 or 6 unit loads (6x150mA= 900&nbsp;mA) for SuperSpeed (USB 3.0 and up) devices.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ USB power standards\n|-\n!

In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.\n\nThe most significant technical differences between FireWire and USB include:\n\n* USB networks use a [[star network|tiered-star]] topology, while IEEE&nbsp;1394 networks use a [[tree network|tree]] topology.\n* USB&nbsp;1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a \"speak-when-spoken-to\" protocol, meaning that each peripheral communicates with the host when the host specifically requests it to communicate. USB&nbsp;3.0 allows for device-initiated communications towards the host. A FireWire device can communicate with any other node at any time, subject to network conditions.\n* A USB network relies on a single host at the top of the tree to control the network. All communications are between the host and one peripheral. In a FireWire network, any capable node can control the network.\n* USB runs with a 5&nbsp;[[Volts|V]] power line, while FireWire in current implementations supplies 12&nbsp;V and theoretically can supply up to 30&nbsp;V.\n* Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical 500&nbsp;mA/2.5&nbsp;W of current, only 100&nbsp;mA from non-hub ports. USB&nbsp;3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8&nbsp;A/9.0&nbsp;W (for dedicated battery charging, 1.5&nbsp;A/7.5&nbsp;W full bandwidth or 900&nbsp;mA/4.5&nbsp;W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60&nbsp;watts of power, although 10 to 20&nbsp;watts is more typical.\n\nThese and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire&nbsp;400 is faster than USB&nbsp;2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use,<ref>{{cite web|title=FireWire vs. USB 2.0|url=http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|publisher=QImaging|accessdate=2010-07-20|format=PDF|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011050049/http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2010}}</ref> especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |title= FireWire vs. USB&nbsp;2.0 \u2013 Bandwidth Tests |accessdate= 2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070812045719/http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |archivedate= 12 August 2007 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |title=USB&nbsp;2.0 vs FireWire |publisher=Pricenfees |accessdate=2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016063120/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |archivedate=16 October 2016  }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,847716,00.asp |title=The Great Interface-Off: FireWire Vs.

They operate at 48&nbsp;V&nbsp;[[Direct current|DC]] and can supply more power (up to 12.95&nbsp;W for ''af'', 25.5&nbsp;W for ''at'' aka ''PoE+'', 71&nbsp;W for ''bt'' aka ''4PPoE'') over a cable up to 100&nbsp;meters compared to USB&nbsp;2.0, which provides 2.5&nbsp;W with a maximum cable length of 5&nbsp;meters. This has made PoE popular for [[VoIP]] telephones, [[security camera]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.\n\n[[Ethernet]] standards require electrical isolation between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) and the network cable up to 1500&nbsp;V&nbsp;AC or 2250&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC for 60&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | title = 802.3, Section 14.3.1.1 | format = PDF | publisher = IEEE | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206030247/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | archivedate = 6 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds.

However, Power over Ethernet and the [[MIDI]] plug standard have an advantage in high-end devices that may have long cables. USB can cause [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems between equipment, because it connects ground references on both transceivers. By contrast, the MIDI plug standard and [[Ethernet]] have built-in isolation to {{gaps|500|V}} or more.\n\n=== eSATA/eSATAp ===\nThe [[eSATA]] connector is a more robust [[SATA]] connector, intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA's transfer rate (up to 6&nbsp;Gbit/s) is similar to that of USB&nbsp;3.0 (up to 5&nbsp;Gbit/s on current devices; 10&nbsp;Gbit/s speeds via USB&nbsp;3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.\n\neSATA does not supply power to external devices. This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB. Even though USB&nbsp;3.0's 4.5&nbsp;W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage. [[eSATAp]] (power over eSATA; aka ESATA/USB) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power to attached devices using a new, backward compatible, connector. On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5&nbsp;V to power a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12&nbsp;V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD/SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives.\n\neSATAp support can be added to a desktop machine in the form of a bracket connecting the motherboard SATA, power, and USB resources.\n\neSATA, like USB, supports [[hot plugging]], although this might be limited by OS drivers and device firmware.\n\n=== Thunderbolt ===\n[[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] combines [[PCI Express]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]] into a new serial data interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10&nbsp;Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |title=How Thunderbolt Technology Works: Thunderbolt Technology Community |publisher=Thunderbolttechnology.net |accessdate=2014-01-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210063142/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archivedate=10 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n[[Thunderbolt 2]] uses link aggregation to combine the two 10&nbsp;Gbit/s channels into one bidirectional 20&nbsp;Gbit/s channel.\n\n[[Thunderbolt 3]] uses the [[USB-C]] connector.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|title=One port to rule them all: Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 and USB Type-C join forces|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602195337/http://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|archivedate=2015-06-02|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 is twice as fast and uses reversible USB-C |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603000428/http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |archivedate=2015-06-03  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 embraces USB Type-C connector, doubles bandwidth to 40&nbsp;Gbps |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=2015-06-02|website=Ars Technica |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609183247/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |archivedate=2015-06-09  }}</ref> Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 has two physical 20&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channels, aggregated to appear as a single logical 40&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channel. Thunderbolt 3 controllers can incorporate a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 controller to provide compatibility with USB devices. They are also capable of providing DisplayPort alternate mode over the USB-C connector, making a Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 port a superset of a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort alternate mode.\n\nAfter the specification was made royalty-free and custodianship of the Thunderbolt protocol was transferred from Intel to the USB Implementers' Forum, Thunderbolt 3 has been effectively implemented in the USB4 specification \u2013 with compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 optional but encouraged for USB4 products \u2014 with Thunderbolt 4 being applied to products that are compatible with USB4's complete feature set. \n\n== Interoperability ==\n{{Main|USB adapter}}\nVarious [[protocol converter]]s are available that convert USB data signals to and from other communications standards.\n\n== Security threats ==\n\n* [[BadUSB]]<ref name=BadUSB></ref>, see also [[USB flash drive#BadUSB]]\n* Intel cpus, from Skylake, allow to take control over them from USB 3.0.<ref>https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/where-theres-a-jtag-theres-a-way/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCUrG7ERIE</ref><ref>https://habr.com/ru/company/pt/blog/318744/</ref>\n* [[USB Killer]]\n* USB flash drives were dangerous for first versions of Windows XP because they were configured by default to execute program shown in Autorun.inf immediately after plugging flash drive in, malware could be automatically activated with usage of that.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[DockPort]]\n* [[Easy Transfer Cable]]\n* [[Extensible Host Controller Interface]] (XHCI)\n* [[LIO Target]]\n* [[List of device bit rates#Peripheral]]\n* [[Media Transfer Protocol]]\n* [[Mobile High-Definition Link]]\n* [[WebUSB]]\n* [[USB-C]]\n* [[Thunderbolt (interface)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist |refs=\n<ref name=\"spec_3.0\">{{cite book | url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | title=Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | date=6 June 2011 |via=www.usb.org | publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard Company]] [[Intel Corporation]] [[Microsoft Corporation]] [[NEC Corporation]] [[ST-Ericsson]] [[Texas Instruments]] | format=[[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519092924/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | archivedate=19 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}<br />{{cite web |title= Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | url= http://www.gaw.ru/pdf/interface/usb/USB%203%200_english.pdf |date= 2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2012-12-29 |via= www.gaw.ru | df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"usb.org 3.1\">{{cite web |title=USB 3.1 Specification{{snd}} Language Usage Guidelines from USB-IF |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |via=www.usb.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312135950/http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2016  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"xmos2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.epsglobal.com/downloads/XMOS/Why-do-you-need-USB-Audio-Class-2.pdf |title=Why do you need USB Audio Class 2? |last=Strong |first=Laurence |date=2015 |publisher=XMOS |quote=In applications where streaming latency is important, UAC2 offers up to an 8x reduction over UAC1. ...
