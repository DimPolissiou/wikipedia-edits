The second and last edition of the Stanford competition was officially made part of the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] (WICB) calendar in 2008, after which the tournament ended when its sponsor [[Allen Stanford]] was charged with fraud and arrested in June 2009. The next organised Twenty20 competition came about with the creation of the Caribbean Twenty20 tournament by the WICB. The Caribbean Twenty20 was created to fill the gap left by the end of the Stanford 20/20 and to coincide with the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]] tournament, which started less than two months after. The top domestic team from the Caribbean Twenty20 tournament qualified for the Champions League as the sole representative of the West Indies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/462587.html |title=WICB unveils domestic T20 tournament |date=10 June 2010 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe WICB first announced the plans for the Caribbean Premier League in September 2012 when it was revealed that the board was \"in the advanced stages of discussions to have a commercial Twenty20 league in the region\" with an unnamed investor and hoped to conclude a deal before 30 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/current/story/581404.html |title=WICB working on launching 'commercial T20 league' \u2013 Hilaire |date=8 September 2012 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=8 September 2012 }}</ref> On 14 September, the board met to make decisions on the structure and organisation of the Caribbean Twenty20 CPL Schedule in January;<ref> https://web.archive.org/web/20180604091229/http://www.cplt20live.org/caribbean-premier-league-cpl-t20-schedule-squads-fixtures</ref> to discuss the governance structure of the board and also discuss the planned commercial Twenty20 league and to finalise its structure.

In the group stage, the teams each play ten matches overall, three of which are at home. This unusual format occurs because all six teams are co-located at a single playing site for five sequential matches of the tourney, then the whole tournament moves to a new location for five more games (and so on). Six stadiums are used (see Venues below), each a home field for one of the teams. The playoff stage includes two semi-finals and a final to determine the winner of the tournament. All three of the elimination playoff games will be played at Queen's Park Oval and Brian Lara Stadium .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/604695.html |title=Caribbean Premier League to contract 90 players |date=13 February 2013 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=7 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Salary cap==\nAs of 30 December 2015, the Caribbean Premier League's salary cap is US$1,000,000 per season.

It was created in 2013 and replaced the [[Caribbean Twenty20]] as the premier Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean. It is currently sponsored by [[Hero MotoCorp]] and consequently officially named the '''Hero CPL'''.<ref name=limacol>{{cite news |url=http://cplt20.com/news/cpl-signs-title-sponsorship-agreement |title=CPL signs title sponsorship agreement |date=25 June 2013 |publisher=Caribbean Premier League |accessdate=28 June 2013 }}</ref> The inaugural tournament was won by the [[Jamaica Tallawahs]] who defeated the [[Guyana Amazon Warriors]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/match-report/jamaica-lift-inaugural-cpl-title/73237|title=Jamaica lift inaugural CPL title|publisher=Wisden India|date=August 2005, 2013|access-date=25 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802145115/http://www.wisdenindia.com/match-report/jamaica-lift-inaugural-cpl-title/73237|archive-date=2 August 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nTwenty20 domestic cricket first appeared in an organised manner in the West Indies in 2006 with the privately organised [[Stanford 20/20]]. The second and last edition of the Stanford competition was officially made part of the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] (WICB) calendar in 2008, after which the tournament ended when its sponsor [[Allen Stanford]] was charged with fraud and arrested in June 2009. The next organised Twenty20 competition came about with the creation of the Caribbean Twenty20 tournament by the WICB. The Caribbean Twenty20 was created to fill the gap left by the end of the Stanford 20/20 and to coincide with the [[2010 Champions League Twenty20]] tournament, which started less than two months after. The top domestic team from the Caribbean Twenty20 tournament qualified for the Champions League as the sole representative of the West Indies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/462587.html |title=WICB unveils domestic T20 tournament |date=10 June 2010 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=10 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe WICB first announced the plans for the Caribbean Premier League in September 2012 when it was revealed that the board was \"in the advanced stages of discussions to have a commercial Twenty20 league in the region\" with an unnamed investor and hoped to conclude a deal before 30 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/current/story/581404.html |title=WICB working on launching 'commercial T20 league' \u2013 Hilaire |date=8 September 2012 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=8 September 2012 }}</ref> On 14 September, the board met to make decisions on the structure and organisation of the Caribbean Twenty20 CPL Schedule in January;<ref> https://web.archive.org/web/20180604091229/http://www.cplt20live.org/caribbean-premier-league-cpl-t20-schedule-squads-fixtures</ref> to discuss the governance structure of the board and also discuss the planned commercial Twenty20 league and to finalise its structure.

In the group stage, the teams each play ten matches overall, three of which are at home. This unusual format occurs because all six teams are co-located at a single playing site for five sequential matches of the tourney, then the whole tournament moves to a new location for five more games (and so on). Six stadiums are used (see Venues below), each a home field for one of the teams. The playoff stage includes two semi-finals and a final to determine the winner of the tournament. All three of the elimination playoff games will be played at Queen's Park Oval and Brian Lara Stadium .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/604695.html |title=Caribbean Premier League to contract 90 players |date=13 February 2013 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=7 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Salary cap==\nAs of 30 December 2015, the Caribbean Premier League's salary cap is US$1,000,000 per season.

He won a [[Tony Award]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn '''Abram Solman Borowitz''' in [[New York City]], Burrows graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and later attended both City College and [[New York University]]. He began working as a runner on Wall Street while at NYU, and he also worked in an accounting firm. After he met Frank Galen in 1938, the two wrote and sold jokes to an impressionist who appeared on [[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]]'s radio program.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio===\nHis radio career gained strength when he collaborated with [[Ed Gardner]], the writer and star of radio's legendary ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''. The two created the successful series after Gardner's character, Archie, premiered on ''This Is New York'', an earlier radio program. Burrows was made the show's head writer in 1941, and he credited his experience with inventing the Runyonesque street characters he fashioned for ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''. \"The people on that show,\" Burrows once said about ''Duffy's Tavern'', \"were New York mugs, nice mugs, sweet mugs, and like ([[Damon Runyon|Damon) Runyon]]'s mugs they all talked like ladies and gentlemen. That's how we treated the characters in ''Guys and Dolls''.\"\n\nBurrows also wrote for [[Danny Kaye]]'s short-lived mid-1940s radio comedy show, helping head writer [[Goodman Ace]] fashion material for Kaye and co-stars [[Eve Arden]] and [[Lionel Stander]]. He quit ''Duffy's Tavern'' in 1945 to work at Paramount Pictures but soon returned to radio. As a guest on ''Here's Morgan'' in 1947, Burrows performed \"I'll Bet You're Sorry Now, Tokyo Rose, Sorry for What You Done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he became a popular guest on the Hollywood party circuit, performing his own satirical songs (\"Darling Why Shouldn't You Look Well Fed, \u2018Cause You Ate Up a Hunka My Heart?\" and \"The Girl with the Three Blue Eyes\"). Such informal performances led to a nightclub act and regular appearances as a performer on CBS radio programs, and to his eventually hosting his own [[radio program]], ''The Abe Burrows Show'', ([[CBS]]) from 1947 to 1949.<ref name=\"dunningota\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access=registration |quote=The Abe Burrows Show, sophisticated. |last1=Dunning |first1=John| title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio| date=1998| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=New York, NY| isbn=978-0-19-507678-3| page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/n34 3]| edition=Revised| accessdate=2019-08-20}}</ref> As he recalled years later, his show came about while he was scripting a radio show for [[Joan Davis]] when [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] asked him, \"When the hell are you gonna become a professional?\" Burrows continued as Davis' head writer while doing his own show.\n\nMixing comic patter (\"I guess I could tell you exactly what I look like, but I think that's a lousy thing to say about a guy\") with his clever comic songs, ''The Abe Burrows Show'' was popular with listeners and critics but not with its sponsor, Lambert Pharmaceutical, then the makers of Listerine mouthwash, but promoting a Listerine toothpaste on the show. Lambert, according to Burrows, complained that the show wasn't selling much of the toothpaste. \"It seems that my fans were being naughty,\" he wrote. \"While they were laughing at my jokes, they were sneering at my toothpaste.\"\n\n===Broadway===\nBoth of Burrows' radio shows originated from [[KNX (AM)|KNX]], CBS's [[Los Angeles]] affiliate, whose program director Ernie Martin encouraged Burrows, who had done some film work, to think about writing plays. \"I told him I felt my funny stuff was okay for radio, but I didn't think people would pay theater prices to hear it,\" Burrows recalled.\n\nBurrows credited his success in the theatre to his work under the theatre legend [[George S. Kaufman]]. In the Kaufman biography by Howard Teichmann, Burrows is quoted as saying that what he said (as a director, to his cast) was what he heard Kaufman say in their collaboration on ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''.\n\nEventually, Burrows wrote, doctored, or directed such shows as ''[[Make a Wish (musical)|Make a Wish]]'', ''[[Two on the Aisle]]'', ''[[Three Wishes for Jamie]]'', ''[[Say, Darling]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', ''[[Cactus Flower (play)|Cactus Flower]]'', ''[[Four on a Garden]]'', ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'', ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', ''[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]'' (1974 revival), and many others. With his collaborator [[Frank Loesser]], Burrows won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.''\n\nBurrows wrote and directed the first Broadway musical version of a [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[First Impressions (musical)|First Impressions]]'', a rewriting of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. The show, which ran for 84 performances in 1959, is widely described as a flop. Burrows thought that critics panned the show because they wondered why a comedy guy was taking on \"tired period drama,\" but the script shows some unusual choices. Burrows had his version of heroine Elizabeth Bennet decide to join forces with her marriage-hungry mother in order to snag hero Mr. Darcy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=137|isbn=1421422824}}</ref>\n\nBurrows also became a famous script doctor, enough so that the desperate remark of a producer, \"Get me Abe Burrows!\", remained for many years Broadway shorthand for a script that needed repair. Yet Burrows himself downplayed that role in his memoir, and discussed his fixing of ''Make a Wish'':\n:I have... performed surgery on a few shows, but not as many as I'm given credit for. I've been involved in 19 theatrical productions, plus their road company offshoots. Only a few of these have been surgical patients. And I don't usually talk about them. I feel that a fellow who doctors a show should have the same ethical approach that a plastic surgeon has. It wouldn't be very nice if a plastic surgeon were walking down the street with you, and a beautiful girl approached. And you say, \"What a beautiful girl.\" And the plastic surgeon says, \"She was a patient of mine. You should have seen her before I fixed her nose.\" Doctoring seldom cures a show. The sickness usually starts at the moment the author puts the first sheet of paper in his typewriter. All the redirecting and recasting can never help much if the basic story is wrong.\n\n''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' was apparently selected as the winner for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Letters. However, because of Burrows' troubles with the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), no Pulitzer for Letters was awarded in 1951, as the Trustees of Columbia University had the right of veto.\n\nBurrows wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Solid Gold Cadillac]]'' in 1956 as well as produced a television series ''[[Abe Burrows' Almanac]]'' (1950) and ''The Big Party'' (1959).\n\nIn 1980, he published his memoir, ''Honest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?'', in which he recalled the meat of his career. His mentored several comedy writers,  including future ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' writer [[Larry Gelbart]] (who was once a ''Duffy's Tavern'' writer), [[Nat Hiken]], [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]] and [[Woody Allen]], the latter a distant cousin of Burrows.\n\n===Television===\n\nOver three decades, Burrows appeared as a panelist on such programs as ''[[This Is Show Business]]'', ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', and ''[[Match Game 77]]'', all on CBS.

He won a [[Tony Award]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn '''Abram Solman Borowitz''' in [[New York City]], Burrows graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and later attended both City College and [[New York University]]. He began working as a runner on Wall Street while at NYU, and he also worked in an accounting firm. After he met Frank Galen in 1938, the two wrote and sold jokes to an impressionist who appeared on [[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]]'s radio program.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio===\nHis radio career gained strength when he collaborated with [[Ed Gardner]], the writer and star of radio's legendary ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''. The two created the successful series after Gardner's character, Archie, premiered on ''This Is New York'', an earlier radio program. Burrows was made the show's head writer in 1941, and he credited his experience with inventing the Runyonesque street characters he fashioned for ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''. \"The people on that show,\" Burrows once said about ''Duffy's Tavern'', \"were New York mugs, nice mugs, sweet mugs, and like ([[Damon Runyon|Damon) Runyon]]'s mugs they all talked like ladies and gentlemen. That's how we treated the characters in ''Guys and Dolls''.\"\n\nBurrows also wrote for [[Danny Kaye]]'s short-lived mid-1940s radio comedy show, helping head writer [[Goodman Ace]] fashion material for Kaye and co-stars [[Eve Arden]] and [[Lionel Stander]]. He quit ''Duffy's Tavern'' in 1945 to work at Paramount Pictures but soon returned to radio. As a guest on ''Here's Morgan'' in 1947, Burrows performed \"I'll Bet You're Sorry Now, Tokyo Rose, Sorry for What You Done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he became a popular guest on the Hollywood party circuit, performing his own satirical songs (\"Darling Why Shouldn't You Look Well Fed, \u2018Cause You Ate Up a Hunka My Heart?\" and \"The Girl with the Three Blue Eyes\"). Such informal performances led to a nightclub act and regular appearances as a performer on CBS radio programs, and to his eventually hosting his own [[radio program]], ''The Abe Burrows Show'', ([[CBS]]) from 1947 to 1949.<ref name=\"dunningota\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access=registration |quote=The Abe Burrows Show, sophisticated. |last1=Dunning |first1=John| title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio| date=1998| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=New York, NY| isbn=978-0-19-507678-3| page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/n34 3]| edition=Revised| accessdate=2019-08-20}}</ref> As he recalled years later, his show came about while he was scripting a radio show for [[Joan Davis]] when [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] asked him, \"When the hell are you gonna become a professional?\" Burrows continued as Davis' head writer while doing his own show.\n\nMixing comic patter (\"I guess I could tell you exactly what I look like, but I think that's a lousy thing to say about a guy\") with his clever comic songs, ''The Abe Burrows Show'' was popular with listeners and critics but not with its sponsor, Lambert Pharmaceutical, then the makers of Listerine mouthwash, but promoting a Listerine toothpaste on the show. Lambert, according to Burrows, complained that the show wasn't selling much of the toothpaste. \"It seems that my fans were being naughty,\" he wrote. \"While they were laughing at my jokes, they were sneering at my toothpaste.\"\n\n===Broadway===\nBoth of Burrows' radio shows originated from [[KNX (AM)|KNX]], CBS's [[Los Angeles]] affiliate, whose program director Ernie Martin encouraged Burrows, who had done some film work, to think about writing plays. \"I told him I felt my funny stuff was okay for radio, but I didn't think people would pay theater prices to hear it,\" Burrows recalled.\n\nBurrows credited his success in the theatre to his work under the theatre legend [[George S. Kaufman]]. In the Kaufman biography by Howard Teichmann, Burrows is quoted as saying that what he said (as a director, to his cast) was what he heard Kaufman say in their collaboration on ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''.\n\nEventually, Burrows wrote, doctored, or directed such shows as ''[[Make a Wish (musical)|Make a Wish]]'', ''[[Two on the Aisle]]'', ''[[Three Wishes for Jamie]]'', ''[[Say, Darling]]'', ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', ''[[Cactus Flower (play)|Cactus Flower]]'', ''[[Four on a Garden]]'', ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'', ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (musical)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', ''[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]'' (1974 revival), and many others. With his collaborator [[Frank Loesser]], Burrows won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.''\n\nBurrows wrote and directed the first Broadway musical version of a [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[First Impressions (musical)|First Impressions]]'', a rewriting of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. The show, which ran for 84 performances in 1959, is widely described as a flop. Burrows thought that critics panned the show because they wondered why a comedy guy was taking on \"tired period drama,\" but the script shows some unusual choices. Burrows had his version of heroine Elizabeth Bennet decide to join forces with her marriage-hungry mother in order to snag hero Mr. Darcy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=137|isbn=1421422824}}</ref>\n\nBurrows also became a famous script doctor, enough so that the desperate remark of a producer, \"Get me Abe Burrows!\", remained for many years Broadway shorthand for a script that needed repair.

In the past the nickname \"Rock Ape\" has been attributed to their traditional role guarding areas of Gibraltar,[43] but this is not so. The term came into use after an accident in the Western Aden Protectorate in November 1952. Two RAF Regiment officers serving with the Aden Protectorate Levies at Dhala decided to amuse themselves by going out to shoot some of the hamadryas baboons (locally referred to as \"rock apes\"). The officers drew rifles and split up to hunt the apes. In the semi-darkness one of the officers fired at a moving object in the distance. When he reached the target he discovered he had shot the other officer. After emergency treatment Flight Lieutenant Percy Henry Mason survived to return to service a few months later. When asked by a board of inquiry why he had fired at his friend the officer replied that his target had \"looked just like a rock ape\" in the half light. The remark soon reverberated around the RAF and it was not long before the term was in general use.[44]\n\nAnother version of the nickname rationale was that the German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels heard the legend that, if the barbary apes on the Rock of Gibraltar ever left, the British Empire would crumble. At that stage of the war, when things were not going well for the Axis forces, he decided that a propaganda coup was required and reportedly sent a commando raid to eradicate the apes. The story goes that Winston Churchill heard of the mission and immediately tasked the RAF Regiment with protecting the apes, and thus the nickname was born.[45] \n*''Rockette'' - WAAF of the Auxiliary RAF Regiment.\n*''Rodney'' - Ground crew name for commissioned officers, the Army call their junior officers \"Ruperts\" often pronounced Woopert and Wodeney.\n*''Rolling Goat'' - An ongoing confusing or disorganised situation; a debacle.\n*''Rook'' - Boy Entrant term for a new entrant.\n*''ROP'' - Restriction of privileges (post 1955 official name for Jankers).\n*''Rover'' - [[Coastal Command]] armed patrol for opportunity attacking of shipping.\n*''RTH'' (abbreviation) - Automatic system built into a drone which allows it to safely Return to Home on mission completion orany problems \n*''Ruddy'' - Common euphonism in the 1940s for 'Bloody'.\n*''Run Around'' - A vehicle being used for non-official purposes.\n\n== S ==\n\n*''Sandbag (pull up)'' - Going to tell a story.\n*''Sardine can'' - Any torpedo plane.\n*''Satan's sister'' - A slanderer or libeler of either sex\n*''SASO'' (abbreviation) - Senior Air [[Staff Officer]].

In the past the nickname \"Rock Ape\" has been attributed to their traditional role guarding areas of Gibraltar,[43] but this is not so. The term came into use after an accident in the Western Aden Protectorate in November 1952. Two RAF Regiment officers serving with the Aden Protectorate Levies at Dhala decided to amuse themselves by going out to shoot some of the hamadryas baboons (locally referred to as \"rock apes\"). The officers drew rifles and split up to hunt the apes. In the semi-darkness one of the officers fired at a moving object in the distance. When he reached the target he discovered he had shot the other officer. After emergency treatment Flight Lieutenant Percy Henry Mason survived to return to service a few months later. When asked by a board of inquiry why he had fired at his friend the officer replied that his target had \"looked just like a rock ape\" in the half light. The remark soon reverberated around the RAF and it was not long before the term was in general use.[44]\n\nAnother version of the nickname rationale was that the German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels heard the legend that, if the barbary apes on the Rock of Gibraltar ever left, the British Empire would crumble. At that stage of the war, when things were not going well for the Axis forces, he decided that a propaganda coup was required and reportedly sent a commando raid to eradicate the apes. The story goes that Winston Churchill heard of the mission and immediately tasked the RAF Regiment with protecting the apes, and thus the nickname was born.[45] \n*''Rockette'' - WAAF of the Auxiliary RAF Regiment.\n*''Rodney'' - Ground crew name for commissioned officers, the Army call their junior officers \"Ruperts\" often pronounced Woopert and Wodeney.\n*''Rolling Goat'' - An ongoing confusing or disorganised situation; a debacle.\n*''Rook'' - Boy Entrant term for a new entrant.\n*''ROP'' - Restriction of privileges (post 1955 official name for Jankers).\n*''Rover'' - [[Coastal Command]] armed patrol for opportunity attacking of shipping.\n*''RTH'' (abbreviation) - Automatic system built into a drone which allows it to safely Return to Home on mission completion orany problems \n*''Ruddy'' - Common euphonism in the 1940s for 'Bloody'.\n*''Run Around'' - A vehicle being used for non-official purposes.\n\n== S ==\n\n*''Sandbag (pull up)'' - Going to tell a story.\n*''Sardine can'' - Any torpedo plane.\n*''Satan's sister'' - A slanderer or libeler of either sex\n*''SASO'' (abbreviation) - Senior Air [[Staff Officer]].

Its first railway was the first line in Switzerland, the so-called [[Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn]] that opened in 1847, and that line now carries long distance passenger trains, freight trains and suburban trains of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]]. However the stations of the S-Bahn are well separated, with only five stations in the distance to be covered by the Limmattal line. The [[Limmattal tramway]] provided more local transport from 1900, but closed in stages between 1928 and 1955, being replaced by buses. The roads of the Limmat Valley are now at capacity, leading to delays to both bus and car traffic. It estimated that traffic will continue to grow, with 113,000 extra journeys a day by 2030.<ref name=Port>{{cite web |url=https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |language=German |title=Portrait |publisher=Limmattalbahn AG |accessdate=31 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531142617/https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |archivedate=31 May 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt is against this background that the Limmattal light rail line was proposed as a solution. Planning began in 2000, and by 2007 the line was included in the cantonal plans of Aargau and Z\u00fcrich. In 2010, the Limmattalbahn AG company was founded by the cantons to plan and implement the infrastructure for the line. A referendum, held in November 2015, approved the construction of the line, and it was announced in May 2016 that the line would be operated by [[BDWM Transport]], who also operate the [[Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon railway line|Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon line]]. Construction commenced in August 2017, and phase 1 between Farbhof and Schlieren is expected to open in 2020. A further referendum called by opponents in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in an attempt to have phase 2 cancelled was defeated, and  \nthe line is expected to be fully opened throughout in 2022.<ref name=OpOff/><ref name=wmr/><ref name=Port/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186 |first1=Stefan |last1=Hotz |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last2=M\u00fcller |title=Nur das Limmattal selbst stimmt gegen \u00absein\u00bb neues Tram |language=German |trans-title=Only the Limmattal itself voted against \"its\" new tram |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=22 November 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228082218/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405 |first=Corsin |last=Zander |title=Aargauer betreiben Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |language=German |trans-title=Aargau company to operate Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228075100/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |title=Ein Baustopp bleibt im Z\u00fcrcher Kantonsparlament ohne Chance |language=German |trans-title=A freeze on construction in the Zurich Cantonal Parliament will have no chance |publisher=Swiss Radio and Television |date=9 April 2018 |accessdate=3 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605101548/https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |archivedate=5 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |title=83 percent want Limmattalbahn |first=Andrew |last=Moglestue |date=24 September 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127130631/http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |archivedate=27 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen fully open, light rail trains will run every 15 minutes between [[Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten railway station|Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten]] and [[Killwangen-Spreitenbach railway station|Killwangen-Spreitenbach]] stations, with the ability to later increase the frequency to every 7.5 minutes.

Its first railway was the first line in Switzerland, the so-called [[Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn]] that opened in 1847, and that line now carries long distance passenger trains, freight trains and suburban trains of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]]. However the stations of the S-Bahn are well separated, with only five stations in the distance to be covered by the Limmattal line. The [[Limmattal tramway]] provided more local transport from 1900, but closed in stages between 1928 and 1955, being replaced by buses. The roads of the Limmat Valley are now at capacity, leading to delays to both bus and car traffic. It estimated that traffic will continue to grow, with 113,000 extra journeys a day by 2030.<ref name=Port>{{cite web |url=https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |language=German |title=Portrait |publisher=Limmattalbahn AG |accessdate=31 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531142617/https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |archivedate=31 May 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt is against this background that the Limmattal light rail line was proposed as a solution. Planning began in 2000, and by 2007 the line was included in the cantonal plans of Aargau and Z\u00fcrich. In 2010, the Limmattalbahn AG company was founded by the cantons to plan and implement the infrastructure for the line. A referendum, held in November 2015, approved the construction of the line, and it was announced in May 2016 that the line would be operated by [[BDWM Transport]], who also operate the [[Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon railway line|Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon line]]. Construction commenced in August 2017, and phase 1 between Farbhof and Schlieren is expected to open in 2020. A further referendum called by opponents in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in an attempt to have phase 2 cancelled was defeated, and  \nthe line is expected to be fully opened throughout in 2022.<ref name=OpOff/><ref name=wmr/><ref name=Port/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186 |first1=Stefan |last1=Hotz |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last2=M\u00fcller |title=Nur das Limmattal selbst stimmt gegen \u00absein\u00bb neues Tram |language=German |trans-title=Only the Limmattal itself voted against \"its\" new tram |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=22 November 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228082218/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405 |first=Corsin |last=Zander |title=Aargauer betreiben Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |language=German |trans-title=Aargau company to operate Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228075100/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |title=Ein Baustopp bleibt im Z\u00fcrcher Kantonsparlament ohne Chance |language=German |trans-title=A freeze on construction in the Zurich Cantonal Parliament will have no chance |publisher=Swiss Radio and Television |date=9 April 2018 |accessdate=3 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605101548/https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |archivedate=5 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |title=83 percent want Limmattalbahn |first=Andrew |last=Moglestue |date=24 September 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127130631/http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |archivedate=27 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen fully open, light rail trains will run every 15 minutes between [[Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten railway station|Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten]] and [[Killwangen-Spreitenbach railway station|Killwangen-Spreitenbach]] stations, with the ability to later increase the frequency to every 7.5 minutes.
