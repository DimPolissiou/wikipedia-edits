In relation to whether or not an emotional support animal should be allowed in a rental property, it is thus necessary to perform an individualized assessment of the specific assistance animal to determine if it poses a direct threat of harm or would cause substantial property damage, and not to assume that an animal is excluded based upon breed or species.

Courts have held that \"otherwise qualified\" means that the tenant must be able to meet the requirements of the program in spite of the handicap. Also, the tenant must be able to meet the general rules of tenancy, such as cleaning up after the animal and walking the animal in designated areas.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" />\n\nThe Majors and Whittier Terrace courts established the foundational principles that a tenant can be \"otherwise qualified\" under Section 504 despite an inability to comply with a \"no pets\" policy, and that a [[waiver]] of a \"no pets\" policy can be a reasonable accommodation under Section 504.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /><ref name=\"http\">{{cite court |litigants= Majors v.

This [[legislative]] gap existed until 1988 when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Fair Housing Act]] Amendments.\n\n==== Fair Housing Act Amendments ====\n\nWhereas only housing authorities receiving federal financial assistance are subject to Section 504, both public and private housing authorities are subject to the provisions of the Fair Housing Act.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Enacted as part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] legislation, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) focused on [[Housing discrimination in the United States|housing discrimination]] on the basis of race, color, national origin, or gender; in 1988, however, the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA) expanded this scope to include handicapped persons.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The FHAA states that it is unlawful \"to discriminate in the sale or rental...of a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter, a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available, or any person associated with that buyer or renter.\" Further, it is discrimination for any person to: \"refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.\" Thus, like Section 504, the FHAA requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for tenants.\n\nAdditionally, the FHAA, in section 3602(h) defines handicap, with respect to a person, as:\n# a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;\n# a record of having such an impairment; or\n# being regarded as having such an impairment.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title = Fair Housing Act |year = 1988 |chapter = 42 |section = 3602 |subsection = (h) |wikilink = Fair Housing Act |link= http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd42usc3602.htm |source=Animal Legal & Historical Center}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"major life activities\" has been interpreted broadly to include those \"activities that are of central importance to daily life,\" such as \"seeing, hearing, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for one's self, learning, speaking, and reproducing.\"<ref name=\"Waterlander 2012\" /> The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) is responsible for administering the FHAA; the [[Attorney General]] and private individuals may enforce it.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\">{{cite journal |last= Huss |first= Rebecca J.|year= 2005 |title= No Pets Allowed: Housing Issues and Companion Animals |url=http://animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/vol11_p69.pdf |journal=Animal Law Review   |volume=11  |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo establish a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of housing discrimination under the FHAA: the tenant must have a qualifying disability, the landlord knew of the handicap or should reasonably be expected to know of it, accommodation of the handicap may be necessary to afford the tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and the landlord must deny the request, such as refusing to waive the \"no pets\" policy.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" />\n\nThe second element, that the landlord knew of the handicap or should have known of it, places an [[Legal burden of proof|affirmative burden]] on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> A tenant wishing to obtain a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter from his or her physician or mental health professional:  stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" /> Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up an animal because of a \"no pets\" policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element of an FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> So long as the requested accommodation does not constitute an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing, the landlord must provide the accommodation.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" />\n\nAlthough the Fair Housing Act covers both [[multi-family dwelling|multi-]] and [[single-family detached home]], the sale or rental of a single family dwelling by an owner is exempt from the statute.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> There are two exceptions to this exemption, however. One is that the exception will not apply if the private individual owner owns more than three single-family homes.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> The other exception to this exemption is the use of a [[real estate agent]] or a broker to rent out the home.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" />\n\nA tenant may be awarded [[actual damages|actual]] and [[punitive damages]], [[injunctions]], and [[attorney fees]] at the discretion of the court for a landlord's violation of the FHAA.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" />\n\nIt is important to note, that though in most cases, landlords do grant ESA's the same reasonable housing accommodations as a service animal, there have been instances where they do not.

Other types of animals used by and for people with disabilities include:\n\n* [[Service animal]]s or [[assistance dog]]s:  Animals, usually dogs, that have been trained to perform specific tasks for a person with a disability.  Subtypes include:\n** [[Guide dog]]s and [[guide horse]]s:  Dogs and miniature horses that have been trained to help a blind person walk independently.\n** [[Hearing dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to identify sounds for a deaf person, such as an alarm or someone calling the person's name.\n** [[Medical response dog]]s: Dogs that have been trained to notice the onset of a medical condition, such as [[hypoglycemia]] in a person with diabetes, and to alert the handler.  \n** [[Mobility assistance dog]]s:  Typically larger dogs, mobility assistance dogs are trained to help persons who have difficulty walking, such as by pulling a wheelchair, opening doors, or letting the handlers lean on the dogs for stability and support while walking.  \n** [[Psychiatric service dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to perform specific tasks, such as entering a room to determine whether it poses any threat to the handler.  This includes [[autism service dog]]s.\n** [[Seizure response dog]]s:  Similar to medical response dogs, these dogs are trained to alert their handlers to the onset of an [[epileptic seizure]].\n* [[Therapy cat]]s and [[therapy dog]]s:  Cats or dogs that comfort people in difficult situations, such as people in [[hospice]] care.  Unlike assistance dogs, therapy animals are not usually trained to perform specific tasks, and the people they interact with may not be disabled.  Unlike emotional service animals, they are not necessarily owned by a person with a disability, but instead visit different people, who may or may not be disabled, through programs in healthcare institutions, schools, or disaster areas.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Law}}\n* [[Animal-assisted therapy]]\n* [[Reasonable accommodation]]\n* [[Service dog]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web| url= https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-assistance-animal-laws |title=Assistance Animal State Laws|website=animallaw.info |publisher=Michigan State University}} \n*{{cite web| url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures  |title=Disabilities and Medical Conditions|website=tsa.gov|publisher= TSA (Transport Security Administration}}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Assistance animals]]\n[[Category:Emotional issues]]\n", "text_old": "{{globalize|date=March 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2016}}\n\nAn '''emotional support animal''' ('''ESA''') is a type of animal that provides comfort to help relieve a symptom or effect of a person's disability.

This [[legislative]] gap existed until 1988 when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Fair Housing Act]] Amendments.\n\n==== Fair Housing Act Amendments ====\n\nWhereas only housing authorities receiving federal financial assistance are subject to Section 504, both public and private housing authorities are subject to the provisions of the Fair Housing Act.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Enacted as part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] legislation, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) focused on [[Housing discrimination in the United States|housing discrimination]] on the basis of race, color, national origin, or gender; in 1988, however, the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA) expanded this scope to include handicapped persons.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The FHAA states that it is unlawful \"to discriminate in the sale or rental...of a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter, a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available, or any person associated with that buyer or renter.\" Further, it is discrimination for any person to: \"refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.\" Thus, like Section 504, the FHAA requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for tenants.\n\nAdditionally, the FHAA, in section 3602(h) defines handicap, with respect to a person, as:\n# a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities;\n# a record of having such an impairment; or\n# being regarded as having such an impairment.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title = Fair Housing Act |year = 1988 |chapter = 42 |section = 3602 |subsection = (h) |wikilink = Fair Housing Act |link= http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusfd42usc3602.htm |source=Animal Legal & Historical Center}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"major life activities\" has been interpreted broadly to include those \"activities that are of central importance to daily life,\" such as \"seeing, hearing, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for one's self, learning, speaking, and reproducing.\"<ref name=\"Waterlander 2012\" /> The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) is responsible for administering the FHAA; the [[Attorney General]] and private individuals may enforce it.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\">{{cite journal |last= Huss |first= Rebecca J.|year= 2005 |title= No Pets Allowed: Housing Issues and Companion Animals |url=http://animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/vol11_p69.pdf |journal=Animal Law Review   |volume=11  |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTo establish a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of housing discrimination under the FHAA: the tenant must have a qualifying disability, the landlord knew of the handicap or should reasonably be expected to know of it, accommodation of the handicap may be necessary to afford the tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and the landlord must deny the request, such as refusing to waive the \"no pets\" policy.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" />\n\nThe second element, that the landlord knew of the handicap or should have known of it, places an [[Legal burden of proof|affirmative burden]] on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> A tenant wishing to obtain a waiver of a \"no pets\" policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter from his or her physician or mental health professional:  stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for an emotional support animal.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" /> Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up an animal because of a \"no pets\" policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability.<ref name=\"animallaw.info\" /> The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element of an FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> So long as the requested accommodation does not constitute an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing, the landlord must provide the accommodation.<ref name=\"bazelon.org\" />\n\nAlthough the Fair Housing Act covers both [[multi-family dwelling|multi-]] and [[single-family detached home]], the sale or rental of a single family dwelling by an owner is exempt from the statute.<ref name=\"Huss 2005\" /> There are two exceptions to this exemption, however.

Other types of animals used by and for people with disabilities include:\n\n* [[Service animal]]s or [[assistance dog]]s:  Animals, usually dogs, that have been trained to perform specific tasks for a person with a disability.  Subtypes include:\n** [[Guide dog]]s and [[guide horse]]s:  Dogs and miniature horses that have been trained to help a blind person walk independently.\n** [[Hearing dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to identify sounds for a deaf person, such as an alarm or someone calling the person's name.\n** [[Medical response dog]]s: Dogs that have been trained to notice the onset of a medical condition, such as [[hypoglycemia]] in a person with diabetes, and to alert the handler.  \n** [[Mobility assistance dog]]s:  Typically larger dogs, mobility assistance dogs are trained to help persons who have difficulty walking, such as by pulling a wheelchair, opening doors, or letting the handlers lean on the dogs for stability and support while walking.  \n** [[Psychiatric service dog]]s:  Dogs that have been trained to perform specific tasks, such as entering a room to determine whether it poses any threat to the handler.  This includes [[autism service dog]]s.\n** [[Seizure response dog]]s:  Similar to medical response dogs, these dogs are trained to alert their handlers to the onset of an [[epileptic seizure]].\n* [[Therapy cat]]s and [[therapy dog]]s:  Cats or dogs that comfort people in difficult situations, such as people in [[hospice]] care.  Unlike assistance dogs, therapy animals are not usually trained to perform specific tasks, and the people they interact with may not be disabled.  Unlike emotional service animals, they are not necessarily owned by a person with a disability, but instead visit different people, who may or may not be disabled, through programs in healthcare institutions, schools, or disaster areas.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Law}}\n* [[Animal-assisted therapy]]\n* [[Reasonable accommodation]]\n* [[Service dog]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web| url= https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-assistance-animal-laws |title=Assistance Animal State Laws|website=animallaw.info |publisher=Michigan State University}} \n*{{cite web| url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/special-procedures  |title=Disabilities and Medical Conditions|website=tsa.gov|publisher= TSA (Transport Security Administration}}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Assistance animals]]\n[[Category:Emotional issues]]\n", "name_user": "2601:248:4400:b1b0:d048:f1a3:180:ef42", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_support_animal"}

After winning an Australian Junior and several Senior karting Championships he moved overseas to race [[Kart racing|karts]] in Europe before making the transition into [[Formula Ford]]. During his karting career he lost his right-index finger at the first joint in an accident, however this didn't affect his racing.\n\nCompeting in only his second [[Formula Ford]] event, Ingall finished third in a support race at the [[1988 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]]. Over the next few years Ingall proved to be a force in the [[Motorcraft Formula Ford Driver to Europe Series]] finishing runner-up before claiming the crown in the 1990. In 1990, he co-drove a [[Bob Forbes Racing]] [[Holden Commodore VL#Commodore SS Group A SV|Holden Commodore VL]] at the [[1990 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] with [[Kevin Bartlett (racing driver)|Kevin Bartlett]]\n\nIngall headed to Europe in 1991. After almost claiming the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] in 1991, and making a promising debut in the GM-Lotus formula, Ingall moved to Germany to drive for Opel Team Schuebel in the [[German Formula Three Championship]]. Ingall also had the opportunity to compete in Peter Wearing Smith's team at the [[Macau Grand Prix]], where he started 23rd and overtook [[David Coulthard]] to finish in fifth position.\n\nOver the northern winter Ingall competed in the New Zealand Dunlop [[Formula Ford]] series, winning easily with 10 victories from 12 races.\n\nIngall made history in 1993 returning to the United Kingdom to drive for the factory [[Van Diemen]] team to win 13 out of the 16 races in the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] and in the process recording the highest number of wins in a single season in the history of [[Formula Ford]].\n\nThe season was finished off by winning one of the most prestigious single-seater events \u2013 the [[Formula Ford]] Festival and World Cup at [[Brands Hatch]] in [[UK|Britain]].\n\nIngall was never able to live up to his full potential in Europe due to a lack of funding and later returned to Australia. This is common for Australian race drivers in Europe.\n\n==V8 Supercar==\n\n===Part-time drives===\n\nAfter spending the first half of 1994 in the [[All-Japan Formula Three|Japanese Formula 3 Championship]] Ingall made his return to Touring Cars, having previously driven for the [[Bob Forbes Racing]] team in 1990, driving for [[Wayne Gardner Racing]] at the [[1994 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] and [[1994 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. Ingall and [[Win Percy]] led at Bathurst for some time before finishing fifth.\n\n===Perkins Engineering===\n\nIngall went on to win the 1995 British [[Formula Renault]] Championship before joining [[Perkins Engineering]] for its campaign for the endurance races back in Australia. Ingall figured prominently in the team's epic last to first victory at Bathurst. He would then become a permanent face of the [[V8 Supercar]] Championship throughout [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship|1996 season]].\n\nDuring his first year, Ingall claimed his maiden victory at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park]] and then went on to win the [[Bathurst 1000]] for the second time in 1997. He also finished second in [[1998 FAI 1000|1998]] and [[2002 Bathurst 1000|2002]].\n\nIn his seven years with Perkins Engineering, Ingall finish runner-up in the championship three times ([[1998 Australian Touring Car Championship|1998]], [[1999 V8 Supercar season|1999]] and [[2001 V8 Supercar season|2001]]) and was third in [[1997 Australian Touring Car Championship|1997]].\n\n===Stone Brothers Racing===\n\n[[File:CaltexFalcon.jpg|thumb|left|Russell Ingall with his Caltex Falcon]]\nFollowing seven years with the Perkins team Ingall moved to [[Stone Brothers Racing]] at the start of 2003 in winning style taking out the support races at the [[Australian Grand Prix]].\n\nHe also went on to win rounds at the Queensland 300 and the Gillette V8 Supercar Challenge at the [[Lexmark Indy 300]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] before eventually finishing seventh outright in the championship.\n\nIn 2004 Ingall was again consistent with the highlight of the season coming with a round win at [[Symmons Plains]] in round 12. In the final round at [[Eastern Creek Raceway]], he finished third overall to jump from fourth to second in the championship in his [[Caltex]] [[Ford Falcon BA]] and give Stone Brothers Racing an historic 1\u20132 finish as his teammate [[Marcos Ambrose]] won the championship.\n\nIn 2005 Ingall went one better, collecting his first [[V8 Supercar]] championship after having been runner-up four times. Ingall went into the season with a plan and he followed it to the final race of the season, which was held at the [[Phillip Island (Victoria)|Phillip Island]] circuit. He raced \"smarter\" than he ever had before and worked out his strategy around the [[V8 Supercars]] points system to collect the title ahead of [[Craig Lowndes]] and Marcos Ambrose.\n\nIn 2006 Ingall saw the championship slip from his grasp due to poor performance from his car which saw him finish the championship in eighth place.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2007 season finale, Ingall announced he was Holden bound, thus leaving Stone Brothers Racing and Ford after five years. He finished the championship for the first time outside the top 10, placing a disappointing eleventh. For 2008 Ingall moved to [[Paul Morris Motorsport]].\n\n===Supercheap Auto Racing===\n\nIngall returned to the Holden fray in 2008 with [[Paul Morris Motorsport]], now sponsored by automotive parts retailer [[Supercheap Auto]]. Ingall's debut race meeting for his new team proved less than ideal.  Finishing in 14th place in the first leg of the [[Clipsal 500]], contact with the wall at Turn 8 during the morning warmup saw steering and suspension damage to the No. 39 car.  Repairs were made in time for the start of Race 2, but the car was not the same, and he retired after just two laps, with failure in the ignition system.\n\n\u201cIf I didn't stick it in (during) the warm up, the distributor drive would have probably gone in the warm-up so we would have found the problem before the race, so one thing led to another,\" said Ingall. \"At the end of the day it was all related to the shunt.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Ingall was joined by New Zealander [[Greg Murphy]]. Ingall remained with Paul Morris Motorsport until the end of 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Ingall moved to [[Walkinshaw Racing]], with the Supercheap Auto sponsorship.\n\nIn 2013, Ingall continued the use of the No. 66 car, however, 2013 saw the change to the new [[Holden VF Commodore]]. Ingall's form for the year thus far has been inconsistent. At [[2013 Sucrogen Townsville 400|Townsville]], Ingall celebrated his 226th race start (a new record beating [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]'s 225) by using No. 226 on his car. In the Endurance events, Ingall teamed up with IndyCar racer [[Ryan Briscoe]].\n\n===Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport===\n\nAfter toying with the idea of retiring from full-time motorsports in 2014, Ingall announced returned to V8 Supercars in the 2014 season with Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport.<ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2014/02/04/ingall-announces-full-time-ldm-drive/ Russell Ingall announces 2014 drive with Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport.]</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2014, Ingall retired from full-time driving. He will still compete as a co-driver in the three endurance races.<ref>[http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/ingall-confirms-retirement-from-full-time-racing Ingall confirms retirement from full-time racing] V8 Supercars 8 December 2014</ref>\n\n===Return to V8 Supercars===\n\nIngall signed with the [[Holden Racing Team]] to race in the endurance series after [[James Courtney]] was injured in a freak accident. Ingall competed in the [[Sandown 500]] and the [[2015 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] with HRT. \n\nWith Courtney returning to race in the [[Gold Coast 600]], [[Prodrive Racing Australia]] signed Ingall as a replacement for the injured [[Chaz Mostert]].\n\n===Nissan Motorsport===\n\nIngall signed with [[Nissan Motorsport (Australia)|Nissan Motorsport]] to race in the Pirtek Enduro Cup in 2016 and joined [[Rick Kelly]] in the No. 15 Nissan Altima.\n\n==Other racing==\n\nIn October 2018, Ingall made his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] debut at [[Sydney Motorsport Park]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Tom|last2=Herrero|first2=Dan|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/10/25/ingall-joins-sydney-stadium-trucks-field/|title=Ingall joins Sydney Stadium Trucks field|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=25 October 2018|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> He finished seventh and fifth in the weekend's two races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/2018-sydney-race-1/|title=Round 15 \u2013 Sydney, Australia \u2013 10/27/18|work=[[Stadium Super Trucks]]|accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/2018-sydney-race-2/|title=Round 16 \u2013 Sydney, Australia \u2013 10/28/18|work=[[Stadium Super Trucks]]|accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref> The following year, he returned to the series for the Gold Coast 600 round.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herrero|first=Daniel|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/10/19/ingall-announces-gold-coast-sst-start/|title=Ingall announces Gold Coast SST start|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=19 October 2019|accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Media career==\n\nIn 2015, Ingall was appointed a co-host on [[Fox Sports Australia|Fox Sports]] coverage of [[V8 Supercars]] with five-time champion and former rival [[Mark Skaife]].\n\nIngall hosts an online video series titled ''Enforcer and The Dude'' alongside [[Paul Morris (racing driver)|Paul Morris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/04/19/video-enforcer-the-dude-bench-racing-episode-1/|title=VIDEO: Enforcer & The Dude \u2013 Bench Racing: Episode 1|work=[[Speedcafe]]|date=19 April 2019|accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:Holden VE Commodore of Russell Ingall.jpg|thumb|The [[Paul Morris Motorsport]] [[Holden VE Commodore]] of Russell Ingall at the [[2011 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\n[[File:Holden VE Commodore of Russell Ingall 2012.JPG|thumb|The [[Holden VE Commodore]] of Russell Ingall at the [[2012 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\n[[File:Holden VF Commodore of Russell Ingall 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Holden VF Commodore]] of Russell Ingall at the [[2013 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He won his V8 Supercars title in [[2005 V8 Supercar season|2005]], and finished second in [[1998 Australian Touring Car Championship|1998]], [[1999 V8 Supercar season|1999]], [[2001 V8 Supercar season|2001]] and [[2004 V8 Supercar season|2004]]. Ingall has also won the [[Bathurst 1000]], in [[1995 Tooheys 1000|1995]] and [[1997 Primus 1000 Classic|1997]]. His particular driving style earned him the nickname \"Enforcer\".<ref>[http://v8supercars.com.au/championship/teams-and-drivers/russell-ingall V8 Supercars official website\u2013Russell Ingall bio.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303112121/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/championship/teams-and-drivers/russell-ingall |date=3 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, he drove for [[Nissan Motorsport (Australia)|Nissan Motorsport]] as a co-driver alongside Rick Kelly in the [[Enduro Cup|Pirtek Enduro Cup]] series.\n\n==Early years==\nIngall began his motor racing career at age 12 competing at the [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]] go-kart track in South Australia. After winning an Australian Junior and several Senior karting Championships he moved overseas to race [[Kart racing|karts]] in Europe before making the transition into [[Formula Ford]]. During his karting career he lost his right-index finger at the first joint in an accident, however this didn't affect his racing.\n\nCompeting in only his second [[Formula Ford]] event, Ingall finished third in a support race at the [[1988 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]]. Over the next few years Ingall proved to be a force in the [[Motorcraft Formula Ford Driver to Europe Series]] finishing runner-up before claiming the crown in the 1990. In 1990, he co-drove a [[Bob Forbes Racing]] [[Holden Commodore VL#Commodore SS Group A SV|Holden Commodore VL]] at the [[1990 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] with [[Kevin Bartlett (racing driver)|Kevin Bartlett]]\n\nIngall headed to Europe in 1991. After almost claiming the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] in 1991, and making a promising debut in the GM-Lotus formula, Ingall moved to Germany to drive for Opel Team Schuebel in the [[German Formula Three Championship]]. Ingall also had the opportunity to compete in Peter Wearing Smith's team at the [[Macau Grand Prix]], where he started 23rd and overtook [[David Coulthard]] to finish in fifth position.\n\nOver the northern winter Ingall competed in the New Zealand Dunlop [[Formula Ford]] series, winning easily with 10 victories from 12 races.\n\nIngall made history in 1993 returning to the United Kingdom to drive for the factory [[Van Diemen]] team to win 13 out of the 16 races in the [[British Formula Ford Championship]] and in the process recording the highest number of wins in a single season in the history of [[Formula Ford]].\n\nThe season was finished off by winning one of the most prestigious single-seater events \u2013 the [[Formula Ford]] Festival and World Cup at [[Brands Hatch]] in [[UK|Britain]].\n\nIngall was never able to live up to his full potential in Europe due to a lack of funding and later returned to Australia. This is common for Australian race drivers in Europe.\n\n==V8 Supercar==\n\n===Part-time drives===\n\nAfter spending the first half of 1994 in the [[All-Japan Formula Three|Japanese Formula 3 Championship]] Ingall made his return to Touring Cars, having previously driven for the [[Bob Forbes Racing]] team in 1990, driving for [[Wayne Gardner Racing]] at the [[1994 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] and [[1994 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. Ingall and [[Win Percy]] led at Bathurst for some time before finishing fifth.\n\n===Perkins Engineering===\n\nIngall went on to win the 1995 British [[Formula Renault]] Championship before joining [[Perkins Engineering]] for its campaign for the endurance races back in Australia. Ingall figured prominently in the team's epic last to first victory at Bathurst. He would then become a permanent face of the [[V8 Supercar]] Championship throughout [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship|1996 season]].\n\nDuring his first year, Ingall claimed his maiden victory at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park]] and then went on to win the [[Bathurst 1000]] for the second time in 1997. He also finished second in [[1998 FAI 1000|1998]] and [[2002 Bathurst 1000|2002]].\n\nIn his seven years with Perkins Engineering, Ingall finish runner-up in the championship three times ([[1998 Australian Touring Car Championship|1998]], [[1999 V8 Supercar season|1999]] and [[2001 V8 Supercar season|2001]]) and was third in [[1997 Australian Touring Car Championship|1997]].\n\n===Stone Brothers Racing===\n\n[[File:CaltexFalcon.jpg|thumb|left|Russell Ingall with his Caltex Falcon]]\nFollowing seven years with the Perkins team Ingall moved to [[Stone Brothers Racing]] at the start of 2003 in winning style taking out the support races at the [[Australian Grand Prix]].\n\nHe also went on to win rounds at the Queensland 300 and the Gillette V8 Supercar Challenge at the [[Lexmark Indy 300]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] before eventually finishing seventh outright in the championship.\n\nIn 2004 Ingall was again consistent with the highlight of the season coming with a round win at [[Symmons Plains]] in round 12. In the final round at [[Eastern Creek Raceway]], he finished third overall to jump from fourth to second in the championship in his [[Caltex]] [[Ford Falcon BA]] and give Stone Brothers Racing an historic 1\u20132 finish as his teammate [[Marcos Ambrose]] won the championship.\n\nIn 2005 Ingall went one better, collecting his first [[V8 Supercar]] championship after having been runner-up four times. Ingall went into the season with a plan and he followed it to the final race of the season, which was held at the [[Phillip Island (Victoria)|Phillip Island]] circuit. He raced \"smarter\" than he ever had before and worked out his strategy around the [[V8 Supercars]] points system to collect the title ahead of [[Craig Lowndes]] and Marcos Ambrose.\n\nIn 2006 Ingall saw the championship slip from his grasp due to poor performance from his car which saw him finish the championship in eighth place.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2007 season finale, Ingall announced he was Holden bound, thus leaving Stone Brothers Racing and Ford after five years. He finished the championship for the first time outside the top 10, placing a disappointing eleventh. For 2008 Ingall moved to [[Paul Morris Motorsport]].\n\n===Supercheap Auto Racing===\n\nIngall returned to the Holden fray in 2008 with [[Paul Morris Motorsport]], now sponsored by automotive parts retailer [[Supercheap Auto]]. Ingall's debut race meeting for his new team proved less than ideal.  Finishing in 14th place in the first leg of the [[Clipsal 500]], contact with the wall at Turn 8 during the morning warmup saw steering and suspension damage to the No. 39 car.  Repairs were made in time for the start of Race 2, but the car was not the same, and he retired after just two laps, with failure in the ignition system.\n\n\u201cIf I didn't stick it in (during) the warm up, the distributor drive would have probably gone in the warm-up so we would have found the problem before the race, so one thing led to another,\" said Ingall. \"At the end of the day it was all related to the shunt.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Ingall was joined by New Zealander [[Greg Murphy]]. Ingall remained with Paul Morris Motorsport until the end of 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Ingall moved to [[Walkinshaw Racing]], with the Supercheap Auto sponsorship.\n\nIn 2013, Ingall continued the use of the No. 66 car, however, 2013 saw the change to the new [[Holden VF Commodore]]. Ingall's form for the year thus far has been inconsistent. At [[2013 Sucrogen Townsville 400|Townsville]], Ingall celebrated his 226th race start (a new record beating [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]'s 225) by using No. 226 on his car. In the Endurance events, Ingall teamed up with IndyCar racer [[Ryan Briscoe]].\n\n===Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport===\n\nAfter toying with the idea of retiring from full-time motorsports in 2014, Ingall announced returned to V8 Supercars in the 2014 season with Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport.<ref>[http://www.speedcafe.com/2014/02/04/ingall-announces-full-time-ldm-drive/ Russell Ingall announces 2014 drive with Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport.]</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2014, Ingall retired from full-time driving. He will still compete as a co-driver in the three endurance races.<ref>[http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/ingall-confirms-retirement-from-full-time-racing Ingall confirms retirement from full-time racing] V8 Supercars 8 December 2014</ref>\n\n===Return to V8 Supercars===\n\nIngall signed with the [[Holden Racing Team]] to race in the endurance series after [[James Courtney]] was injured in a freak accident. Ingall competed in the [[Sandown 500]] and the [[2015 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] with HRT. \n\nWith Courtney returning to race in the [[Gold Coast 600]], [[Prodrive Racing Australia]] signed Ingall as a replacement for the injured [[Chaz Mostert]].\n\n===Nissan Motorsport===\n\nIngall signed with [[Nissan Motorsport (Australia)|Nissan Motorsport]] to race in the Pirtek Enduro Cup in 2016 and joined [[Rick Kelly]] in the No. 15 Nissan Altima.\n\n==Other racing==\n\nIn October 2018, Ingall made his [[Stadium Super Trucks]] debut at [[Sydney Motorsport Park]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Tom|last2=Herrero|first2=Dan|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/10/25/ingall-joins-sydney-stadium-trucks-field/|title=Ingall joins Sydney Stadium Trucks field|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=25 October 2018|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> He finished seventh and fifth in the weekend's two races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/2018-sydney-race-1/|title=Round 15 \u2013 Sydney, Australia \u2013 10/27/18|work=[[Stadium Super Trucks]]|accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadiumsupertrucks.com/2018-sydney-race-2/|title=Round 16 \u2013 Sydney, Australia \u2013 10/28/18|work=[[Stadium Super Trucks]]|accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref> The following year, he returned to the series for the Gold Coast 600 round.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herrero|first=Daniel|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/10/19/ingall-announces-gold-coast-sst-start/|title=Ingall announces Gold Coast SST start|publisher=[[Speedcafe]]|date=19 October 2019|accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Media career==\n\nIn 2015, Ingall was appointed a co-host on [[Fox Sports Australia|Fox Sports]] coverage of [[V8 Supercars]] with five-time champion and former rival [[Mark Skaife]].\n\nIngall hosts an online video series titled ''Enforcer and The Dude'' alongside [[Paul Morris (racing driver)|Paul Morris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2019/04/19/video-enforcer-the-dude-bench-racing-episode-1/|title=VIDEO: Enforcer & The Dude \u2013 Bench Racing: Episode 1|work=[[Speedcafe]]|date=19 April 2019|accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:Holden VE Commodore of Russell Ingall.jpg|thumb|The [[Paul Morris Motorsport]] [[Holden VE Commodore]] of Russell Ingall at the [[2011 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\n[[File:Holden VE Commodore of Russell Ingall 2012.JPG|thumb|The [[Holden VE Commodore]] of Russell Ingall at the [[2012 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\n[[File:Holden VF Commodore of Russell Ingall 2013.JPG|thumb|The [[Holden VF Commodore]] of Russell Ingall at the [[2013 Clipsal 500 Adelaide]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Contract killing", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Hitman|other uses|Hitman (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|Form of murder}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2019}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{homicide}}\n'''Contract killing''' is a form of [[murder]] in which one party hires another party (often called a '''hitman''') to kill a target individual or group of people. It involves an [[illegal agreement]] between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment, monetary or otherwise. Either party may be a person, group, or organization. Contract killing has been associated with [[organized crime]], [[Conspiracy theory|government conspiracies]], and [[feud|vendetta]]s. For example, in the United States, the gang [[Murder, Inc.]] committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the [[National Crime Syndicate]] during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nContract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing, making it more difficult for [[law enforcement]] to connect said party with the murder. The likelihood that authorities will establish that party's guilt for the committed crime, especially due to lack of [[forensic evidence]] linked to the contracting party, makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party.\n\n==Statistics==\nA study by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] of 162 attempted or actual contract murders in Australia between 1989 and 2002 indicated that the most common reason for murder-for-hire was insurance policy payouts. The study also found that the average payment for a \"hit\" was $15,000 with variation from $5,000 up to $30,000 and that the most commonly used weapons were [[firearms]]. Contract killings accounted for 2% of murders in Australia during that time period.<ref name=\"lovers\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/02/05/australia.killings.offbeat.reut/index.html|title=Lovers top contract killing hit list |date=February 5, 2004|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\nContract killings also make up a relatively similar percentage of all killings elsewhere. For example, they made up about 5% of all murders in [[Scotland]] from 1993 to 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/11/18570/29572|title=Homicide in Scotland, 2002|publisher=Government of Scotland}}</ref>\n\n==Notable cases==\n\n===Perpetrators===\n[[File:Vincent Coll leaving court NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Mad Dog Coll]] leaving court surrounded by police officers, 1931]]\n*[[Mad Dog Coll|Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll]], an [[Irish American|Irish-American]] hitman who worked for [[Dutch Schultz]] and [[Owney Madden]]\n*[[Glennon Engleman]], American dentist who moonlighted as a hitman\n*[[Ray Ferritto]], Italian American hitman and soldier for the Cleveland and Los Angeles crime families, best known for killing [[Danny Greene]]; later he became a government witness and testified against the mob\n*[[Christopher Dale Flannery]], reputed Australian hitman\n*[[Sammy the bull|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]], a former [[underboss]] of the [[Gambino crime family]] turned government cooperator.\n*[[Giuseppe Greco]], a Sicilian hitman who killed at least 58 people during the [[Second Mafia War]]\n*[[Charles Harrelson]], American hitman, father of actor [[Woody Harrelson]]\n*[[Richard Kuklinski]], an American contract killer who claimed to have murdered over 200 men.

It involves an [[illegal agreement]] between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment, monetary or otherwise. Either party may be a person, group, or organization. Contract killing has been associated with [[organized crime]], [[Conspiracy theory|government conspiracies]], and [[feud|vendetta]]s. For example, in the United States, the gang [[Murder, Inc.]] committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the [[National Crime Syndicate]] during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nContract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to carry out the actual killing, making it more difficult for [[law enforcement]] to connect said party with the murder. The likelihood that authorities will establish that party's guilt for the committed crime, especially due to lack of [[forensic evidence]] linked to the contracting party, makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party.\n\n==Statistics==\nA study by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] of 162 attempted or actual contract murders in Australia between 1989 and 2002 indicated that the most common reason for murder-for-hire was insurance policy payouts. The study also found that the average payment for a \"hit\" was $15,000 with variation from $5,000 up to $30,000 and that the most commonly used weapons were [[firearms]]. Contract killings accounted for 2% of murders in Australia during that time period.<ref name=\"lovers\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/02/05/australia.killings.offbeat.reut/index.html|title=Lovers top contract killing hit list |date=February 5, 2004|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\nContract killings also make up a relatively similar percentage of all killings elsewhere. For example, they made up about 5% of all murders in [[Scotland]] from 1993 to 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/11/18570/29572|title=Homicide in Scotland, 2002|publisher=Government of Scotland}}</ref>\n\n==Notable cases==\n\n===Perpetrators===\n[[File:Vincent Coll leaving court NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Mad Dog Coll]] leaving court surrounded by police officers, 1931]]\n*[[Mad Dog Coll|Vincent \"Mad Dog\" Coll]], an [[Irish American|Irish-American]] hitman who worked for [[Dutch Schultz]] and [[Owney Madden]]\n*[[Glennon Engleman]], American dentist who moonlighted as a hitman\n*[[Ray Ferritto]], Italian American hitman and soldier for the Cleveland and Los Angeles crime families, best known for killing [[Danny Greene]]; later he became a government witness and testified against the mob\n*[[Christopher Dale Flannery]], reputed Australian hitman\n*[[Sammy the bull|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]], a former [[underboss]] of the [[Gambino crime family]] turned government cooperator.\n*[[Giuseppe Greco]], a Sicilian hitman who killed at least 58 people during the [[Second Mafia War]]\n*[[Charles Harrelson]], American hitman, father of actor [[Woody Harrelson]]\n*[[Richard Kuklinski]], an American contract killer who claimed to have murdered over 200 men.

These songs did not hit with her fanbase because she didn't promote them as aggressively as she did her previous songs.\n\nOn May 17, 2019, Loren Gray released a new single titled \"Can't Do It\" featuring American rapper [[Saweetie]]. It marks her first single as a lead artist to feature another artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8511412/loren-gray-playlist-takeover-tuesday|title=Takeover Tuesday Playlist: Loren Gray Soundtracks 'Missing Someone' With Shawn Mendes, Drake & More|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> No one has really heard this besides her young fanbase.\n\nIn February 2020, Gray was featured in the music video for [[Taylor Swift]]'s \"[[The Man (Taylor Swift song)|The Man]]\".\n\nLoren is most known for her photoshopping and jailbait like looks. She commonly uses facetune to make her lips bigger and shaped different, nose smaller and straighter, whiten the outsides of her eyes, extremely blur her skin, and shape her body to look smaller at her waist. While she is pretty, her fans agree she often goes way overboard on the photoshop, especially with the eyes. Loren is unable to post a picture without extremely filtering it on her stories. When apps like instagram and snapchat began showing what filters were used, she no longer could pretend she was natural and resorted to saving everything to her camera roll before uploading it. Loren Gray's beauty is based almost entirely off of photoshop which sets a poor example for young girls trying to reach a level of beauty that isn't possible.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{TikTok}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYe4G08okte96rmocFNU1g Loren Gray] on YouTube\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gray, Loren}}\n[[Category:2002 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American TikTokers]]\n[[Category:American YouTubers]]\n[[Category:Female YouTubers]]\n[[Category:Female TikTokers]]\n[[Category:People from Pottstown, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Singers from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Virgin Records artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American singer and social media personality and model}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Loren Gray\n| image              = \n| caption            = \n| birth_name         = Loren Gray Beech\n| birth_date         = {{birth date and age|2002|4|19}}\n| birth_place        = [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]], U.S.\n| nationality        = American\n| other_names        = \n| occupation         = {{hlist|Singer|social media personality}}\n| years_active       = 2015\u2013present\n| known_for          = [[TikTok]] (previously known as [[musical.ly]]),\nsinging, and social media\n| module             = {{Infobox YouTube personality\n| embed                = yes\n| pseudonym            = \n| channel_direct_url   =channel/UCRYe4G08okte96rmocFNU1g\n| channel_display_name = Loren Gray\n| location             = \n| years_active         = 2015\u2013present\n| subscribers          = 3.7 million\n| subscriber_date      =\n| views                = 72.4 million\n| genre                = Music, beauty, fashion\n| silver_button        = yes\n| silver_year          = \n| gold_button          = yes\n| gold_year            = \n| diamond_button       = \n| diamond_year         = \n| ruby_button          = \n| ruby_year            = \n| stats_update         = March 14, 2020\n}}\n}}\n'''Loren Gray Beech'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2018/06/loren-gray-twitter/|title=Loren Gray Returns to Twitter as @LoorenGraay|last=Farrell|first=Paul|date=2018-06-25|website=Heavy.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109112142/https://heavy.com/entertainment/2018/06/loren-gray-twitter/|archive-date=2018-11-09|url-status=live}}</ref> (born April 19, 2002) is an American singer and [[social media personality]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popdust.com/woman-crush-wednesday-loren-gray-2610818395.html|title=#WomanCrushWednesday {{!}} Loren Gray|last=10207037939562084|date=2018-10-17|website=Popdust|language=en|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> from [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/a25844917/loren-gray-facts/|title=11 Fun Facts About Pop Star Loren Gray|last=Twersky|first=Carolyn|date=2019-01-10|website=Seventeen|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110215558/https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/a25844917/loren-gray-facts/|archive-date=2019-01-10|url-status=live}}</ref> She has 42.2 million [[TikTok]] followers,<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://tiktok.com/@lorengray|title=Loren Gray's TikTok Profile|last=Gray|first=Loren|website=TikTok|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> 19.1 million [[Instagram]] followers,<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/loren/?hl=en|title=Loren Gray Instagram page|website=Instagram}}</ref> and 3.73 million [[YouTube]] subscribers<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCRYe4G08okte96rmocFNU1g/videos|title=Loren Gray on YouTube|last=Gray|first=Loren|website=YouTube|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> as of March 2020.

These results put him fifth on the 'most podiums' list for drivers at Bathurst.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=Is he still 5th?}}\n\nThirteen top 10 finishes (50% of all his starts) (in addition to above, fourth in [[1979 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1979]], seventh in [[1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1980]] and [[1981 James Hardie 1000|1981]], tenth in [[1989 Tooheys 1000|1989]], fifth in [[1992 Tooheys 1000|1992]] and seventh in [[1994 Tooheys 1000|1994]]). Grice holds the record for the most Bathurst 1000 drives (16) before first victory (of those who have won).{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Bathurst 1986==\n{{main|1986 James Hardie 1000}}\nDriving a [[Holden VK Commodore|Holden VK Commodore SS Group A]] that was owned by his co-driver, [[Graeme Bailey]] and built by his longtime team, [[Roadways Racing]], Grice posted the first 100&nbsp;mph average lap in a [[Group A]] car, backing up his feat of achieving the first 100&nbsp;mph average lap in a [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] specification [[Holden VH Commodore]] in [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]]. Grice's time for the 6.172&nbsp;km circuit in 1986 was a 2:16.16 (compared to his 1982 time of 2:17.8) although he only achieved pole position in 1982.\n\nGrice and Bailey led for all-but 12 laps and Grice drove for 137 of the 163 laps (before the track alterations in response to FIA request reduced the race to 161 laps).\n\n==Bathurst 1990==\n{{main|1990 Tooheys 1000}}\n[[File:Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV of Percy & Grice.jpg|thumb|The winning [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]] from the [[1990 Tooheys 1000]]]] \n[[British Touring Car Championship]] legend [[Win Percy]] was given the task of reviving the fortunes of the Holden Team in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] by [[Tom Walkinshaw]], and against Walkinshaw's wishes Percy chose Grice as his co-driver for Bathurst.\n\nWith Percy carrying a shoulder injury, Grice did the bulk of the testing and race driving for Bathurst.  Competing against a field that included multiple turbo-charged [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth#Sierra RS500 Cosworth|Ford Sierra]]s, Grice and Percy prevailed to record a famous victory in a [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]].\n\n==Racing career==\nThough Grice did race, and win, for Holden factory teams in ATCC (most famously in the Bathurst 1000 in 1990), he spent much of his career as a privateer racing in a Holden against the Holden works teams (typically driven by [[Peter Brock]]).\n\nEarly in his career, Grice was the first racing driver to race the iconic [[Holden Torana#LH|Holden Torana LH SLR/5000]] V8 (though he raced the road-version, L31, not the race-bred, Bathurst winning version, L34).\n\nIn 1974 Grice began driving for the Craven Mild Racing team and the following year he won a number of rounds in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] in his SL/R 5000 Torana.\n\nIn [[1975 Australian Touring Car Championship|1975]], Allan Grice put up his strongest challenge for the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Grice would have won the championship had he not been disqualified from rounds five, seven and eight. In round five, at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]], Grice won the race but was disqualified following a protest lodged by [[Holden Dealer Team]] manager [[Harry Firth]]. Firth correctly contended that the thermostat from the [[Holden V8 engine]] in Grice's Craven Mild Torana L34 was in fact in the car's glovebox and not where it should have been. This led to speculation that Firth had managed to convince one of Grice's mechanics to put the item in the glovebox in a bid to sabotage his season{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which at that point saw Grice leading the points table. Firth's lead driver [[Colin Bond]] went on to win the 1975 ATCC. Grice continued the season after appealing the disqualification, but once the appeal was upheld he lost all points from the remaining rounds.\n\nIn 1978 Grice broke through with a placing in the [[Bathurst 1000]] when he came second behind Peter Brock in a Craven Mild Racing [[Holden Torana#LX|Holden LX Torana A9X SS5000]].\n\nGrice was the winner of the 1978 and 1979 [[Australian Sports Sedan Championship]]s driving [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner's]] [[Chevrolet Corvair]]. Grice also finished fourth with open wheel star [[Alfredo Costanzo]] in the [[1979 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]], though he was some nine laps behind the winning HDT Torana of Peter Brock and [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]], with the Craven Mild Torana hatchback, like the rest of the field, not posing a serious threat to Brock.\n\nIn 1980 the [[Craven A|Craven Mild]] team began driving a [[BMW 3 Series (E21)|BMW 318i Turbo]] in the sports sedan series, first in his usual Craven Mild colours, but later in the black and gold of the [[JPS Team BMW]]. Grice had little success with the car, constantly battling its handling which was not up to the power of the turbocharged engines. Grice's relationship with team manager Gardner had also deteriorated by this time, resulting in his sacking from the JPS team at the end of 1981. This led to a long-standing animosity between Grice and Gardner which lasted until Gardner's death at the age of 78 in 2009. The crux of the animosity was Gardner allegedly not having a high opinion of Grice's aggressive driving style, while Grice also contends that Gardner stole his longtime [[Craven A]] and [[John Player & Sons|JPS]] cigarette sponsorship.\n\nAfter contemplating giving away racing, with no prospects of a competitive drive, Grice was thrown a lifeline by Re-Car owner Alan Browne. Grice was listed to drive with Browne at Bathurst in 1982 and Grice qualified fastest in the team's [[Holden VH Commodore]]. He and Browne  finished second after a duel with the similar Commodore of Peter Brock in the early laps. The following year Grice finished third at Bathurst in an [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] sponsored Roadways Commodore shared with Bond.\n\nGrice holds the distinction of winning the last ever ATCC race held under [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] locally developed [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] rules when he won the final race of the [[1984 Australian Touring Car Championship|1984 ATCC]] at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in a Holden VH Commodore. In a closely fought race, Grice finished less than one second in front of Brock's HDT Commodore, with series champion [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] third in his [[Ford XE Falcon|Ford Falcon]], less than a second behind Brock. Grice also won the last ever competitive Group C race held in Australia when he drove his Roadways [[Holden VK Commodore]] to victory in a race held at the [[Baskerville Raceway]] in [[Tasmania]] in late 1984.\n\nGrice easily won the [[1984 Australian GT Championship]] driving the ex-[[Bob Jane]] DeKon [[Chevrolet Monza]] that had been acquired by Re-Car boss Alan Browne. Grice and the Monza sat on pole for every round of the series and won all but one race, his only loss was when the Monza lost fuel pressure while holding an eight-second lead over the [[Porsche 911|Porsche Carrera RSR]] of Peter Fitzgerald on the last lap of round three at [[Calder Park Raceway]]. In late 1984 Grice was joined by fellow touring car star Johnson and driver-engineer Ron Harrop in the Monza, when they contested the [[1984 Sandown 1000|Sandown 1000]] as part of the [[1984 World Endurance Championship]]. The race was the first ever world championship road race held in Australia. Running in the special \"AC Class\" (for cars in the Australian GT and [[Australian Sports Car Championship|sports car]] championships), Grice qualified the car 18th and second in class, 1.9 seconds shy of the [[1984 Australian Sports Car Championship]] winning [[Romano WE84]]-[[Cosworth DFL|Cosworth]] driven by [[Alfredo Costanzo]] (and almost nine seconds slower than [[Stefan Bellof]]'s pole time in his [[Rothmans]] [[Porsche 956]]). The Monza ran strongly, with Grice reporting that the {{Convert|600|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 6.0 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|Chevrolet]] was able to stay with the faster Porsches on the straights, but lost out to the [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effect]] sports cars through the turns (Johnson claimed that the car had a lot more grunt than its handling deserved, though Grice contended that the Monza handled very well). The Monza was eventually disqualified from the race for receiving outside assistance.\n\nDuring 1984 Grice also competed in the [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Driving a Charles Ivey Racing prepared [[Porsche 956]], with co-drivers [[Alain de Cadenet]] and [[Chris Craft (racing driver)|Chris Craft]], the car was qualified 32nd, but was a DNF with engine failure after 274 laps. Grice, who proved the fastest of the trio despite never having raced at Le Mans or in a 956, was openly critical of the team and their preparation of the car which had a bad habit of losing wheels at high speed. After the Porsche lost a wheel early in the race (before his first driving stint), Grice was heard to say loud enough for everyone in the team to hear that he had race cars at home that did not shed wheels.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McKay, Peter|first1=Naismith, Barry|title=Le Mans 24 Heures De Mans: The Australian Assault|date=August 1984|publisher=Garry Sparke & Associates|location=Glen Waverley, Victoria|isbn=0 908081 02 2|page=22 - Aussie Hopes Crash|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nThough best remembered for his endurance race feats, Grice was a very fast driver. Driving as a privateer, he was the first driver to record a 100&nbsp;mph laps around Bathurst in both a Group C car [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]] and in a Group A car [[1986 James Hardie 1000|1986]] (that time on his way to winning Bathurst).\n\nIn 1987 Grice became the first Australian driver to qualify for [[NASCAR]]'s [[World 600|Coca-Cola 600]] at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]. Gricey was also prominent in the early NASCAR races held in Australia, held in 1988 at the then new, [[Australian dollar|A$]]54 million [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] owned by former racer and prominent businessman Bob Jane. Grice qualified his [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]] sponsored [[Oldsmobile 88#1986\u20131991|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] third for the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500]] at the Thunderdome, the first ever NASCAR race held outside of North America. His race ended on lap 80 when he was caught up in a crash that he could not avoid due to the Oldsmobile having lost its brakes. Grice suffered a broken collar bone in the high speed crash. The race itself was dominated by visiting [[Winston Cup]] drivers [[Neil Bonnett]], [[Bobby Allison]] and [[Dave Marcis]], with Bonnett eventually winning from fellow [[Alabama Gang]] member Allison by just 0.86 seconds.\n\nIn 1990, Grice and his old Roadways touring car team led by team boss and chief mechanic Les Small, developed a left-hand-drive [[Holden VN Commodore]] powered by a 358 cubic inch Chevrolet V8 engine to run in the [[NASCAR in Australia|Australian NASCAR series]], with Grice taking several wins at both the Thunderdome and the 1/2 mile Speedway Super Bowl at the Adelaide International Raceway. Grice, Small and Bob Jane also formed a plan to take the Commodore to America to run in the Winston Cup], though ultimately the plans were shelved.\n\nIn 1988, thanks to his friendship with his [[1987 James Hardie 1000]] co-driver Percy, Grice was drafted into the [[Nismo|Nissan Motorsport Europe]] team for the [[European Touring Car Championship]], driving a [[Nissan Skyline#GTS-R|Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R]]. Percy, Grice, and Swedish driver [[Anders Olofsson]], drove the car to sixth outright in the 1988 [[Spa 24 Hours]]. The Nissan Europe team was managed by former [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford Works Team]] and later [[Gibson Motorsport|Nissan Australia]] team boss from the Australian Group C days, Howard Marsden. Grice also won the inaugural [[1991 James Hardie 12 Hour|Bathurst 12 Hour]] held in 1991 driving a Toyota Supra Turbo with Peter Fitzgerald and Nigel Arkell.\n\nGrice last competed in a full ATCC was in [[1987 Australian Touring Car Championship|1987]]. He was signed by [[Pinnacle Motorsport]] to complete the full [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995]] season, although the relationship was severed mid-year. Grice's final ATCC race was at the 1995 [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] round driving a [[Ford EF Falcon]] for [[Glenn Seton Racing]]. Grice ended his career having won ten rounds in the Australian Touring Car Championship (equal 12th on list of round winners).\n\nGrice continued to compete as an endurance co-driver, his last appearance was at the [[2002 Bathurst 1000]] driving a [[Ford AU Falcon]] entered by V8 Ute series team [[Nilsson Motorsport]]. The Bathurst start, some five years after his previous start, rekindled Grice as a racing driver and he made a comeback to racing in the [[V8 Utes]] series driving Falcon XR8s and forming his own team. He was competitive, winning races with a championship position high of sixth.\n\nSince stepping away from the drivers seat Grice remains a familiar sight at historic racing events as well as supporting the racing career of his son, [[Benjamin Grice]].\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:Holden Torana SS A9X Craven Mild.JPG|thumb|Grice drove a [[Holden LX Torana SS A9X]] for Craven Mild Racing from 1977 to 1980.

Maxwell Grice''' <small></small> (born 21 October 1942), known to motor-racing fans as \"Gricey\", is an Australian former [[racing driver]] and [[politician]], most famous for twice winning the prestigious [[Bathurst 1000]] ([[1986 James Hardie 1000|1986]] and [[1990 Tooheys 1000|1990]]), and as a privateer driver of a [[Holden]] in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]].\n\nGrice also had a successful second career as a politician and Member for [[electoral district of Broadwater|Broadwater]] in the [[Queensland Parliament]] from 1992 to 2001.<ref name=qp>{{cite web|title=Former Members|publisher=[[Parliament of Queensland]]|year=2015| url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/members/former/bio?id=1746923495|accessdate= 4 February 2015}}</ref> He currently{{When|date=March 2017}} operates an LPG conversion and importing business \u2013 LPGricey Tanks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Bathurst 1000 record==\nGrice made 26 starts between 1968 and 2002 ( sixth on the 'most starts' list).\n\nGrice had seven podium finishes at Bathurst: two wins ([[1986 James Hardie 1000|1986]] and [[1990 Tooheys 1000|1990]]), four seconds ([[1978 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1978]], [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]], [[1991 Tooheys 1000|1991]], [[1995 Tooheys 1000|1995]]), and a third ([[1983 James Hardie 1000|1983]]). These results put him fifth on the 'most podiums' list for drivers at Bathurst.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=Is he still 5th?}}\n\nThirteen top 10 finishes (50% of all his starts) (in addition to above, fourth in [[1979 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1979]], seventh in [[1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1980]] and [[1981 James Hardie 1000|1981]], tenth in [[1989 Tooheys 1000|1989]], fifth in [[1992 Tooheys 1000|1992]] and seventh in [[1994 Tooheys 1000|1994]]). Grice holds the record for the most Bathurst 1000 drives (16) before first victory (of those who have won).{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Bathurst 1986==\n{{main|1986 James Hardie 1000}}\nDriving a [[Holden VK Commodore|Holden VK Commodore SS Group A]] that was owned by his co-driver, [[Graeme Bailey]] and built by his longtime team, [[Roadways Racing]], Grice posted the first 100&nbsp;mph average lap in a [[Group A]] car, backing up his feat of achieving the first 100&nbsp;mph average lap in a [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] specification [[Holden VH Commodore]] in [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]]. Grice's time for the 6.172&nbsp;km circuit in 1986 was a 2:16.16 (compared to his 1982 time of 2:17.8) although he only achieved pole position in 1982.\n\nGrice and Bailey led for all-but 12 laps and Grice drove for 137 of the 163 laps (before the track alterations in response to FIA request reduced the race to 161 laps).\n\n==Bathurst 1990==\n{{main|1990 Tooheys 1000}}\n[[File:Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV of Percy & Grice.jpg|thumb|The winning [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]] from the [[1990 Tooheys 1000]]]] \n[[British Touring Car Championship]] legend [[Win Percy]] was given the task of reviving the fortunes of the Holden Team in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] by [[Tom Walkinshaw]], and against Walkinshaw's wishes Percy chose Grice as his co-driver for Bathurst.\n\nWith Percy carrying a shoulder injury, Grice did the bulk of the testing and race driving for Bathurst.  Competing against a field that included multiple turbo-charged [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth#Sierra RS500 Cosworth|Ford Sierra]]s, Grice and Percy prevailed to record a famous victory in a [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]].\n\n==Racing career==\nThough Grice did race, and win, for Holden factory teams in ATCC (most famously in the Bathurst 1000 in 1990), he spent much of his career as a privateer racing in a Holden against the Holden works teams (typically driven by [[Peter Brock]]).\n\nEarly in his career, Grice was the first racing driver to race the iconic [[Holden Torana#LH|Holden Torana LH SLR/5000]] V8 (though he raced the road-version, L31, not the race-bred, Bathurst winning version, L34).\n\nIn 1974 Grice began driving for the Craven Mild Racing team and the following year he won a number of rounds in the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] in his SL/R 5000 Torana.\n\nIn [[1975 Australian Touring Car Championship|1975]], Allan Grice put up his strongest challenge for the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Grice would have won the championship had he not been disqualified from rounds five, seven and eight. In round five, at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]], Grice won the race but was disqualified following a protest lodged by [[Holden Dealer Team]] manager [[Harry Firth]]. Firth correctly contended that the thermostat from the [[Holden V8 engine]] in Grice's Craven Mild Torana L34 was in fact in the car's glovebox and not where it should have been. This led to speculation that Firth had managed to convince one of Grice's mechanics to put the item in the glovebox in a bid to sabotage his season{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which at that point saw Grice leading the points table. Firth's lead driver [[Colin Bond]] went on to win the 1975 ATCC. Grice continued the season after appealing the disqualification, but once the appeal was upheld he lost all points from the remaining rounds.\n\nIn 1978 Grice broke through with a placing in the [[Bathurst 1000]] when he came second behind Peter Brock in a Craven Mild Racing [[Holden Torana#LX|Holden LX Torana A9X SS5000]].\n\nGrice was the winner of the 1978 and 1979 [[Australian Sports Sedan Championship]]s driving [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner's]] [[Chevrolet Corvair]]. Grice also finished fourth with open wheel star [[Alfredo Costanzo]] in the [[1979 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]], though he was some nine laps behind the winning HDT Torana of Peter Brock and [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]], with the Craven Mild Torana hatchback, like the rest of the field, not posing a serious threat to Brock.\n\nIn 1980 the [[Craven A|Craven Mild]] team began driving a [[BMW 3 Series (E21)|BMW 318i Turbo]] in the sports sedan series, first in his usual Craven Mild colours, but later in the black and gold of the [[JPS Team BMW]]. Grice had little success with the car, constantly battling its handling which was not up to the power of the turbocharged engines. Grice's relationship with team manager Gardner had also deteriorated by this time, resulting in his sacking from the JPS team at the end of 1981. This led to a long-standing animosity between Grice and Gardner which lasted until Gardner's death at the age of 78 in 2009. The crux of the animosity was Gardner allegedly not having a high opinion of Grice's aggressive driving style, while Grice also contends that Gardner stole his longtime [[Craven A]] and [[John Player & Sons|JPS]] cigarette sponsorship.\n\nAfter contemplating giving away racing, with no prospects of a competitive drive, Grice was thrown a lifeline by Re-Car owner Alan Browne. Grice was listed to drive with Browne at Bathurst in 1982 and Grice qualified fastest in the team's [[Holden VH Commodore]]. He and Browne  finished second after a duel with the similar Commodore of Peter Brock in the early laps. The following year Grice finished third at Bathurst in an [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] sponsored Roadways Commodore shared with Bond.\n\nGrice holds the distinction of winning the last ever ATCC race held under [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] locally developed [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] rules when he won the final race of the [[1984 Australian Touring Car Championship|1984 ATCC]] at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] in a Holden VH Commodore. In a closely fought race, Grice finished less than one second in front of Brock's HDT Commodore, with series champion [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] third in his [[Ford XE Falcon|Ford Falcon]], less than a second behind Brock. Grice also won the last ever competitive Group C race held in Australia when he drove his Roadways [[Holden VK Commodore]] to victory in a race held at the [[Baskerville Raceway]] in [[Tasmania]] in late 1984.\n\nGrice easily won the [[1984 Australian GT Championship]] driving the ex-[[Bob Jane]] DeKon [[Chevrolet Monza]] that had been acquired by Re-Car boss Alan Browne. Grice and the Monza sat on pole for every round of the series and won all but one race, his only loss was when the Monza lost fuel pressure while holding an eight-second lead over the [[Porsche 911|Porsche Carrera RSR]] of Peter Fitzgerald on the last lap of round three at [[Calder Park Raceway]]. In late 1984 Grice was joined by fellow touring car star Johnson and driver-engineer Ron Harrop in the Monza, when they contested the [[1984 Sandown 1000|Sandown 1000]] as part of the [[1984 World Endurance Championship]]. The race was the first ever world championship road race held in Australia. Running in the special \"AC Class\" (for cars in the Australian GT and [[Australian Sports Car Championship|sports car]] championships), Grice qualified the car 18th and second in class, 1.9 seconds shy of the [[1984 Australian Sports Car Championship]] winning [[Romano WE84]]-[[Cosworth DFL|Cosworth]] driven by [[Alfredo Costanzo]] (and almost nine seconds slower than [[Stefan Bellof]]'s pole time in his [[Rothmans]] [[Porsche 956]]). The Monza ran strongly, with Grice reporting that the {{Convert|600|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 6.0 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine|Chevrolet]] was able to stay with the faster Porsches on the straights, but lost out to the [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effect]] sports cars through the turns (Johnson claimed that the car had a lot more grunt than its handling deserved, though Grice contended that the Monza handled very well). The Monza was eventually disqualified from the race for receiving outside assistance.\n\nDuring 1984 Grice also competed in the [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Driving a Charles Ivey Racing prepared [[Porsche 956]], with co-drivers [[Alain de Cadenet]] and [[Chris Craft (racing driver)|Chris Craft]], the car was qualified 32nd, but was a DNF with engine failure after 274 laps. Grice, who proved the fastest of the trio despite never having raced at Le Mans or in a 956, was openly critical of the team and their preparation of the car which had a bad habit of losing wheels at high speed. After the Porsche lost a wheel early in the race (before his first driving stint), Grice was heard to say loud enough for everyone in the team to hear that he had race cars at home that did not shed wheels.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McKay, Peter|first1=Naismith, Barry|title=Le Mans 24 Heures De Mans: The Australian Assault|date=August 1984|publisher=Garry Sparke & Associates|location=Glen Waverley, Victoria|isbn=0 908081 02 2|page=22 - Aussie Hopes Crash|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nThough best remembered for his endurance race feats, Grice was a very fast driver. Driving as a privateer, he was the first driver to record a 100&nbsp;mph laps around Bathurst in both a Group C car [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]] and in a Group A car [[1986 James Hardie 1000|1986]] (that time on his way to winning Bathurst).\n\nIn 1987 Grice became the first Australian driver to qualify for [[NASCAR]]'s [[World 600|Coca-Cola 600]] at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]. Gricey was also prominent in the early NASCAR races held in Australia, held in 1988 at the then new, [[Australian dollar|A$]]54 million [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] owned by former racer and prominent businessman Bob Jane. Grice qualified his [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]] sponsored [[Oldsmobile 88#1986\u20131991|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] third for the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500]] at the Thunderdome, the first ever NASCAR race held outside of North America. His race ended on lap 80 when he was caught up in a crash that he could not avoid due to the Oldsmobile having lost its brakes. Grice suffered a broken collar bone in the high speed crash. The race itself was dominated by visiting [[Winston Cup]] drivers [[Neil Bonnett]], [[Bobby Allison]] and [[Dave Marcis]], with Bonnett eventually winning from fellow [[Alabama Gang]] member Allison by just 0.86 seconds.\n\nIn 1990, Grice and his old Roadways touring car team led by team boss and chief mechanic Les Small, developed a left-hand-drive [[Holden VN Commodore]] powered by a 358 cubic inch Chevrolet V8 engine to run in the [[NASCAR in Australia|Australian NASCAR series]], with Grice taking several wins at both the Thunderdome and the 1/2 mile Speedway Super Bowl at the Adelaide International Raceway. Grice, Small and Bob Jane also formed a plan to take the Commodore to America to run in the Winston Cup], though ultimately the plans were shelved.\n\nIn 1988, thanks to his friendship with his [[1987 James Hardie 1000]] co-driver Percy, Grice was drafted into the [[Nismo|Nissan Motorsport Europe]] team for the [[European Touring Car Championship]], driving a [[Nissan Skyline#GTS-R|Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R]]. Percy, Grice, and Swedish driver [[Anders Olofsson]], drove the car to sixth outright in the 1988 [[Spa 24 Hours]]. The Nissan Europe team was managed by former [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford Works Team]] and later [[Gibson Motorsport|Nissan Australia]] team boss from the Australian Group C days, Howard Marsden. Grice also won the inaugural [[1991 James Hardie 12 Hour|Bathurst 12 Hour]] held in 1991 driving a Toyota Supra Turbo with Peter Fitzgerald and Nigel Arkell.\n\nGrice last competed in a full ATCC was in [[1987 Australian Touring Car Championship|1987]]. He was signed by [[Pinnacle Motorsport]] to complete the full [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995]] season, although the relationship was severed mid-year. Grice's final ATCC race was at the 1995 [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] round driving a [[Ford EF Falcon]] for [[Glenn Seton Racing]]. Grice ended his career having won ten rounds in the Australian Touring Car Championship (equal 12th on list of round winners).\n\nGrice continued to compete as an endurance co-driver, his last appearance was at the [[2002 Bathurst 1000]] driving a [[Ford AU Falcon]] entered by V8 Ute series team [[Nilsson Motorsport]]. The Bathurst start, some five years after his previous start, rekindled Grice as a racing driver and he made a comeback to racing in the [[V8 Utes]] series driving Falcon XR8s and forming his own team. He was competitive, winning races with a championship position high of sixth.\n\nSince stepping away from the drivers seat Grice remains a familiar sight at historic racing events as well as supporting the racing career of his son, [[Benjamin Grice]].\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:Holden Torana SS A9X Craven Mild.JPG|thumb|Grice drove a [[Holden LX Torana SS A9X]] for Craven Mild Racing from 1977 to 1980.

With the addition of [[Ryuichi Kawamura]], vocalist from the band Slaughter, the five formed the [[visual kei]] rock unit Lunacy.

While in Elementary School, he became obsessed with the ancient civilizations of [[Egypt]], the Maya's [[Easter Island]]s and the [[Inca]].

But their specs are more similar to a Fender Stratocaster than any Gibson, using single coils, alder bodies and maple necks, 25.5\" scale length and tremolos. Lately he's favored a P-90 in the bridge position and vintage-style trems, as opposed to the 3 single coils and Floyd Rose trems he used for most of his career. His signature models feature the ESP logo written in the same font as the Luna Sea band logo, a feature also found on J's and Inoran's signature models.\n\nFor his solo projects and recent shows he also often uses Stratocaster-type guitars from Navigator, a very high-end custom shop related to ESP. His acoustic guitars of choice are usually C.F. Martin Dreadnoughts. He also plays signature electric violins made by Kranz, and his bows are made by Codabow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espguitars.co.jp/gallery/sugizo/ev75/index.html|title=Electric Violin EV-75|accessdate=2017-04-21|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/32978723/Codabow-SUGIZO-Signature-model-Ysaye-guarantee-card|title=Codabow SUGIZO Signature model Ysaye guarantee card|publisher=Behance.net|accessdate=2017-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kurosawa.onlinestore/photos/a.132030063623907.27870.106629086164005/141172692709644/?type=3&theater |script-title=ja:Coda Bow SUGIZO Signature Model \"Ysaye(\u30a4\u30b6\u30a4)|publisher=Kurosawa Music Online|accessdate=2017-04-23|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nHis amps have changed often throughout his career but are generally high-end and boutique brands, including Fender, Marshall, Mesa/Boogie, Matchless, Bogner, Custom Audio Electronics, Divided by 13 and Koch.

He's also performed using an Axe-Fx II.\n\nHis effects are numerous and spanning several pedalboards and racks, but important staples are his DigiTech Whammy pedal for pitch effects, and delays and reverbs from various Eventide pedals and the [[TC Electronic]] 2290 Digital Delay.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!

Currently is set up with SP-90-1 (Seymour Duncan).<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse S-VI\n|The Eclipse S-VI development based on Sugizo's concept, started in 1999 through making prototypes, and was completed in 2001. The 6-stringed model, one octave lower than the other orthodox models, has the same sound range as bass guitars.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse S-VII\n|The Eclipse S-VII was completed in 2000, for making its debut on the ''Brand New Chaos'' tour. Was also used for Sugizo & the Spank Your Juice performances. A thin 45mm nut-width was made for the first time for a 7-stringed guitar. Bridge-string pitch 9.6mm, nut side-string pitch 6.5mm, 7-stringed bridge & rock nut. Also was attached a unique 3 single-coiled pick-up.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse R-I\n|The Eclipse R-I was developed based on a concept Sugizo had cherished for a long time. It made its debut on the 2000 ''Brand New Chaos Act II'' tour, but more than a year had been spent before the model was finally completed in 2001. Its constitution was of single-coiled pick-up and a Floyd Rose Bridge. Its 42mm thin flattop Adler body with broad-surfaced body design has its quick sound response (a bit different from Eclipse S-I) and also has ability to emphasize wide range sounds.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse E-I\n|The Eclipse E-I made its debut at Sugizo's solo project performance ''Abstract Day'' in 1997. It is a semi-acoustic Sugizo model but equipped with Floyd Rose Bridge.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse S-I Brilliant -Mixed Media- \n|The Eclipse S-I Brilliant -Mixed Media-, appeared on July 30, 1996 on the ''Unending Style'' tour, as a custom version of Eclipse S-I. Created as a collaboration between the ESP manufacturing staff and Sugizo. This model was equipped with vintage Lase Blue of Lasesensor for the rear pick-up which was modeled exactly by Sugizo himself. In 1997, after the tour, it was sold as a signature model with a limited number produced.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse S-I Python \n|The Eclipse S-I Python made its debut on December 23, 1998 at the Tokyo Dome on the ''Shining Brightly'' tour. This model was used for both Asian tours and the 2000 ''Brand New Chaos'' tour. In 2000, its sales were limited to 40 because of difficulty to get the real leather of Diamond Pison, but the number of products was increased up to 120.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse S-III Brilliant -Mixed Media- \n|The Eclipse S-III Brilliant -Mixed Media-, as of September 1999, it was put on the market with a limited production of 100. But because of its popularity, two months later 50 more were announced. When it went on the market, Seymour Duncan SJAG-1 carried on the pick-up.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Eclipse S-III Custom -Fretless- \n|For the Eclipse S-III Custom -Fretless-, Sugizo originated the idea that fit sustainers to the fretless guitars, and often uses it for his recordings. Its basic components are the same as the S-III. Black-binding is used, which is rare for Eclipse series.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|PR - Triple Neck\n|The three necks are (each from high to low) 12-stringed guitar, sustainer attached fretless guitar and the Floyd Rose 6-stringed fretted guitar. The pick-ups on each three necks are set to instantaneously change. Presently, the standard models are the same as S-I with Seymour Duncan Antiquity Strat Custom Bridge. Sugizo performed with this triple neck guitar for Luna Sea's openings from 1995's ''Mother of Love'' tour, up to the last stage of ''Epilogue 2000'', with the songs \"[[Mother (Luna Sea album)|Loveless]]\" and \"[[Mother (Luna Sea album)|Genesis of Mind ~Yume no Kanata e~]].<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|PR - Double Neck\n|The combination of a 6-string and a fretless guitar started only with Sugizo. Its pick-ups are EMG-SA for the fretless, and Seymour Duncan Antiquity Strat Custom Bridge for the fretted. The bridges are a combination of Tune-matic-bridge (black nickel coating) and Stop-tailpiece. The first time it was used was for song \"[[Lunacy (album)|4:00 AM]]\" on Luna Sea's 2000 \"Brand New Chaos\" tour.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|[[Seymour Duncan]]\n|DG-300R CTM\n|Sugizo used a [[Fender Jaguar|Jaguar]]-type black guitar (made by [[Seymour Duncan]]) for Luna Sea's 2000 ''Brand New Chaos'' tour. It was a developed type of a Jaguar with new tensions & sustains. The secret to its success was in the scale change from short to medium. Its bridge was equipped with ST's synchronized tremolo.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|Seymour Duncan\n|DS-280M-RV\n|Built for right-handers from a left-hand body and neck, which Sugizo pursued as newer possibilities than the [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]]. Results are both mellower tones in higher-tone strings and tighter low tones in lower-tone strings. He started using this model on Luna Sea's \"Brand New Chaos\" tour, at the live in Yokohama Arena on July 15, 2000. It is known to be responsible for the reversible-strato-tones in \"[[Lunacy (album)|Virgin Mary]]\".<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|-\n|ESP\n|Edwards & GrassRoots \n|List of five [[ESP Edwards Series|Edwards]] guitars, and four GrassRoots guitars Sugizo used on lives respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sugizo Edwards&GrassRoots Guitars|work=espguitars.co.jp|url=http://www.espguitars.co.jp/gallery/sugizo/edwards_grassroots/index.html}}</ref> \n|-\n|ESP\n|(Electric Violin) Kranz EV-75\n|The violin Sugizo plays on his performances.<ref name=esp_sugizo/>\n|}\n\n==Concerts and tours==\n*1997: \"Abstract Day\"\n*2001: \"Sugizo & The Spank Your Juice Abstract Day 2001\"\n*2008\u201309: \"Rise to Cosmic Dance\"\n**Support band: [[Origa]] on vocals, Takumi Samejima on guitar, Fire on bass, [[Greg Ellis (musician)|Greg Ellis]] on drums, d-kiku on keyboards and programming, K-Ta and Kenji Yoshiura on percussion, Shinpei Ruike on trumpet.<ref name=\"RiseCosmic\">{{cite web| url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-6894-sugizo-gig-2008-rise-to-cosmic-dance-.html| title=Sugizo Gig 2008 ~Rise to Cosmic Dance~| work=jame-world.com| accessdate=2011-12-15}}</ref> \n*2009\u201310: \"Next Phase of Cosmic Dance\"\n*2011: \"Stairway to the Flower of Life\"\n**Support band: Origa on vocals, Takumi Samejima on guitar, Tokie on bass, [[Motokatsu Miyagami]] on drums, d-kiku on keyboards and programming, Kenji Yoshiura on percussion, Shinpei Ruike on trumpet.\n\n==Discography==\n;Studio albums\n* ''Truth?''

Since his father was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], while his mother was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], from the young age he has often been in contact with things related to church and Protestantism. Currently, he's more into Buddhism, or more specifically, [[Buddha]] himself.<ref name=\"Music Japan Interview\"/> Ever since he was little he was curious about [[occult]] subjects. While in Elementary School, he became obsessed with the ancient civilizations of [[Egypt]], the Maya's [[Easter Island]]s and the [[Inca]]. One of the very important moments were when he was around 18 or 19 years old, after reading [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'',<ref name=\"Jrockeventsusa Interview\"/> he became even more intrigued about the spiritual world. Noting \"As I grew older, I was able to better understand the things that caught my attention when I was young\".<ref name=\"Music Japan Interview\"/>\n\nSugizo in the interview said that \"there are secrets held by a small elite who control the world... We spend our lives without ever being aware of the truth that is hidden from us\", and so through the song \"Tell Me Why You Hide The Truth?\" meant \"We have to liberate freedom and rebuild it by ourselves. I think the world is in need of a revolution. To know what to believe, to know what's really going on in this world we have to take the initiative. That's the sort of signal I'm trying to send\".<ref name=\"Music Japan Interview\"/> However, he tries to avoid mixing ideology with music because it changes music as such.<ref name=\"metropolis\"/>\n\n===Activism===\nIn 2001, Sugizo participated in [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'s N.M.L.

But their specs are more similar to a Fender Stratocaster than any Gibson, using single coils, alder bodies and maple necks, 25.5\" scale length and tremolos. Lately he's favored a P-90 in the bridge position and vintage-style trems, as opposed to the 3 single coils and Floyd Rose trems he used for most of his career. His signature models feature the ESP logo written in the same font as the Luna Sea band logo, a feature also found on J's and Inoran's signature models.\n\nFor his solo projects and recent shows he also often uses Stratocaster-type guitars from Navigator, a very high-end custom shop related to ESP. His acoustic guitars of choice are usually C.F. Martin Dreadnoughts. He also plays signature electric violins made by Kranz, and his bows are made by Codabow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espguitars.co.jp/gallery/sugizo/ev75/index.html|title=Electric Violin EV-75|accessdate=2017-04-21|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/32978723/Codabow-SUGIZO-Signature-model-Ysaye-guarantee-card|title=Codabow SUGIZO Signature model Ysaye guarantee card|publisher=Behance.net|accessdate=2017-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/kurosawa.onlinestore/photos/a.132030063623907.27870.106629086164005/141172692709644/?type=3&theater |script-title=ja:Coda Bow SUGIZO Signature Model \"Ysaye(\u30a4\u30b6\u30a4)|publisher=Kurosawa Music Online|accessdate=2017-04-23|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nHis amps have changed often throughout his career but are generally high-end and boutique brands, including Fender, Marshall, Mesa/Boogie, Matchless, Bogner, Custom Audio Electronics, Divided by 13 and Koch. Most recently he's been using EVH5150's and EVH 4x12\" cabs with some additional heads like a Diezel Vh4. He's also performed using an Axe-Fx II.\n\nHis effects are numerous and spanning several pedalboards and racks, but important staples are his DigiTech Whammy pedal for pitch effects, and delays and reverbs from various Eventide pedals and the [[TC Electronic]] 2290 Digital Delay.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!

He is the only driver to have won Australia's two most prestigious races, the [[Bathurst 1000]] ([[1974 Bathurst 1000|1974]] and [[1985 James Hardie 1000|1985]]), and the [[Australian Grand Prix]] ([[1976 Australian Grand Prix|1976]]).<ref name=\"oamMS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/v8supercars/news/bathurst-winner-awarded-order-of-australia-medal-1045591/|title=Bathurst winner awarded Order of Australia medal|last=van Leeuwen|first=Andrew|date=11 June 2018|publisher=[[Motorsport.com]]|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring his career, John Goss gained a reputation for long acceptance speeches, with many joking that his victory speech on the Bathurst podium following his 1974 win took almost as long as the race itself (the race, the first to be run in wet conditions, lasted 7 hours, 51 minutes and 43 seconds).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-feature/the-legends-of-bathurst-65355|title=The legends of Bathurst|last=Melville|first=Ally|date=5 October 2017|publisher=[[Drive.com.au]]|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nGoss was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2018 for services to motorsport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.com/news/championship/bathurst-legend-receives-oam/|title=Bathurst legend receives OAM|last=Bartholomaeus|first=Stefan|date=11 June 2018|publisher=Supercars.com|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nHaving moved from Victoria to Tasmania as a child, Goss began racing in his adopted state in [[Holden FJ]]s and [[Ford Customline]]s.<ref name=primotipo/> He then built his own sports car, the Tornado [[Ford]], which he took to the mainland with some success, scoring points in the [[Australian Sports Car Championship]] in both [[1969 Australian Sports Car Championship|1969]] and [[1970 Australian Sports Car Championship|1970]]. He also raced [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon GTHOs]] in production car racing from 1969 and stayed loyal to Ford for much of his career.\n\n==McLeod Ford==\n\n===Series Production===\nGoss debuted at the Bathurst 500 in [[1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1969]] driving a McLeod Ford (with its distinctive yellow/black chequer windscreen strip) sponsored [[Ford XW Falcon|Ford Falcon GTHO]], but Goss's co-driver Dennis Cribbin crashed the Falcon at Forrest's Elbow.<ref name=\"oamMS\"/> In [[1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1970]] John Goss posted the fastest lap during the Bathurst 500 in his [[Ford XW Falcon|XW Falcon GTHO Phase II]]. The following year Goss won two rounds of the [[Toby Lee Series]] at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] against such opposition as [[Colin Bond]] and [[Fred Gibson (motor racing)|Fred Gibson]].\n\nGoss won the 1972 [[South Pacific Touring Series|South Pacific Touring Car Series]] and the [[1972 Sandown 250]] endurance race, both in [[Group E Series Production Touring Cars|Series Production]] [[Ford XY Falcon GT|Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase III's]]. He also put his Falcon on the front row of the grid at the [[1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500]], qualifying second fastest behind the [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Works GTHO]] of expat-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Allan Moffat]]. Engine failure after splashing around for 24 wet laps ended Goss' race.\n\n===Group C===\nWith the Series Production class being replaced by the new [[Group C (Australia)|Group C Touring Car]] class in 1973, Goss was the first driver to develop and race the new [[Ford XA Falcon|Ford Falcon XA GT Hardtop]]. Unlike Series Production, the new Group C rules allowed considerable modifications. Goss obtained sponsorship from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and continued his association with Max McLeod, a prominent Ford dealer (McLeod Ford) in [[Rockdale, New South Wales]] \u2013 known for his \"[[Horn car]]s\" \u2013 as well as obtaining factory assistance from [[Ford Australia]], who provided Goss with purpose-built XA racing chassis. Goss was actually the first to race the XA Hardtop in the [[1973 Australian Touring Car Championship|1973 ATCC]], even before the Works team who used a modified Phase III GTHO and didn't make the switch to the Hardtop until the [[1973 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|Endurance races]] later in the year. Goss and [[Kevin Bartlett (race driver)|Kevin Bartlett]] teamed up for the [[1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] at Bathurst and qualified on [[pole position]] with a time of 2:33.4 (it was to be Goss' only pole at Bathurst) ahead of the [[Holden Torana#LJ|GTR-XU1 Holden Torana]] of [[Peter Brock]] and [[Doug Chivas]]. Goss started and built up a good lead which was kept until he was involved in a crash at The Cutting which damaged his front end.<ref name=\"oamMS\"/> The Falcon suffered radiator damage which later caused its retirement on lap 110 of the now 163 lap race (prior to 1973, race distance was 500 miles and ran only 130 laps).\n\nThe pair returned to Bathurst for the [[1974 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] in the same car \u2013 repainted from yellow to blue after losing [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] as their major sponsor \u2013 and proved to have the reliability needed to last through a race marred by driving rain, finishing first.<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\">{{cite book | title=The official history of The Great Race Bathurst : 50 years | last1=Greenhalgh | first1=David | last2=Tuckey | first2=Bill | publisher=Chevron Publishing Group | year=2013 | isbn=9780980591231 | location=[[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]], [[New South Wales]]}}</ref> To celebrate the victory, [[Ford Australia]] released a limited edition [[Ford XB Falcon|XB Falcon Hardtop]] in 1975 called the [[John Goss Special]].

During the mid-1970s Goss was concentrating his racing efforts more on the F5000 than his Croup C Falcons and ever loyal to Ford tried to run the A53 with a [[Ford 335 engine#302 Cleveland|5.0L Ford V8]] but the concept had little success.\n\n==Jaguar==\n\n===Group C===\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Goss registered three 'Did Not Finish' results at Bathurst driving Falcons with [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Henri Pescarolo]] as co-driver. In the [[1977 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] he ran a second team car for Australia's three time [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]] [[Jack Brabham]], and Jack's son [[Geoff Brabham|Geoff]].<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\"/>\n\nThen in 1980, Goss began campaigning a [[Jaguar V12 engine#5.3|V12]] powered [[Jaguar XJS]] at Bathurst, at first with no luck. In the [[1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1980 race]] he started what was basically a standard car from 58th on the grid, but lasted only 14 laps before retiring with gearbox failure. In [[1981 James Hardie 1000|1981]], he teamed with [[1965 Armstrong 500|1965]] winner [[Barry Seton]] in the XJS, and after an improved qualifying effort (19th), they weren't classified as finishers of the crash shortened race having completed only 73 of the 120 laps and being caught up in the crash on the top of the mountain. Goss returned with a better prepared effort in [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]], sharing the driving with [[United States|American]] [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] Jaguar [[Sports car racing|sports car]] race driver / team owner [[Bob Tullius]], who also assisted with technical info for the car and engine. Goss qualified the car 14th with a time of 2:22.3 (almost 5 seconds slower than pole sitter [[Allan Grice]] in a [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] [[Holden VH Commodore|Holden Commodore]], but some 5.7 seconds faster than he had achieved in 1981), but after a strong, consistent run, once again the big cat failed to finish following suspension failure on lap 119.\n\nGoss missed the [[1983 James Hardie 1000]], but returned in [[1984 James Hardie 1000|1984]] for the last year of Australia's Group C racing sharing a drive with [[Tom Walkinshaw]], team owner of the [[European Touring Car Championship]]s [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]]. Walkinshaw, who ran three factory backed [[Group A]] XJS' in the ETCC (and would go on to win that title in 1984), added a lot of technical assistance to the team with revised suspension and the use of one of TWR's own V12 engines. Despite trouble in qualifying with no suitable rear tyres arriving in time to use, the [[Scottish people|Scot]] qualified the car in 8th with a 2:16.09 lap (faster than Peter Brock's 1983 pole time), before falling to 10th in the Hardies Heroes top ten run-off with a 2:18.96, again due to unsuitable rear tyres. Walkinshaw also started the race never left the line. The Jags clutch had gone leaving Walkinshaw stranded with his arm out the window warning other drivers he was stationary. Before the race Walkinshaw had informed [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]], who was lined up behind him on that grid, that he wasn't confident of a quick start as the cars clutch was designed for the rolling starts used in the ETCC. Harvey took the precaution to line his [[Holden Dealer Team|HDT]] [[Holden VK Commodore|VK Commodore]] so that he could get around the slow starting Jag if needed, a tactic which allowed him to avoid the chaos that ensued. Unfortunately in the dust kicked up off the start, the [[Kevin Bartlett (racing driver)|Kevin Bartlett]] owned [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)#1979|Chevrolet Camaro]] of John Tesoriero was coming through at speed and could not avoid the #12 Jag, hitting it in the rear. The Camaro was then hit by the fast starting [[Toyota Supra#1984|Toyota Celica Supra]] of [[Peter Williamson (racing driver)|Peter Williamson]] causing a start line pile up. This caused the race to be stopped as the track was completely blocked by the three cars involved, with the back half of the field having to stop to avoid the incident. It would be the only time the race has ever been restarted in its history. While Goss later admitted that the team could have repaired the Jaguar and re-joined the race, the decision was made to withdraw the car as the repairs would have taken almost half the race.\n\n===Group A===\n[[File:John Goss 1985 Bathurst winning Jaguar XJS (14917976168).jpg|thumb|The 1980 [[Jaguar XJ-S]] John Goss repainted as a replica of the [[1985 James Hardie 1000]] race winner]]\nAustralian Touring Car racing changed to International Group A rules in [[1985 Australian Touring Car season|1985]], and Goss scored his second and last ourtight [[1985 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst win]] that year with [[West German]] co-driver [[Armin Hahne]] in one of a three-car assault on the Great Race by Tom Walkinshaw's TWR team using the 1984 ETCC-winning V12 Jaguar XJS' (Walkinshaw had been stung by the bad showing in 1984 and was determined to bring his own team back to conquer the race). Goss, installed by Walkinshaw as lead driver of the team's third car (#10), actually qualified fastest going into Hardies Heroes, giving lie to those who believed he was past his best as a driver and that Walkinshaw had made an error by having him drive. He ended up 6th in the Top Ten run-off after mistakes on both laps (1985 was the last year that cars were given two laps in Hardies Heroes).\n\nThe cars were held on the grid for a long time before the green flag was shown. This caused several cars, including the Goss Jaguar, to start overheating. To avoid this Goss actually turned the car off and only restarted it when the 30 second sign was shown, though the car was still overheating. Goss made a good start and for the opening laps was in a dice for 2nd with [[Allan Grice]] (Commodore), [[Robbie Francevic]] ([[Volvo 200 series#Motorsport|Volvo]]), [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] ([[Ford Mustang (third generation)#1983\u20131986|Ford Mustang]]), [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] ([[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]]) and [[Peter Brock]] (Commodore). First Francevic, then Goss, broke free of the dice. Once free of the dice, Goss would chase down and take second from the Volvo in less than 10 laps, giving Jaguar a 1-2 on the road for the first time since the early laps before the team's second car driven by [[Jeff Allam]] retired with engine failure. From then on, the Goss/Hahne Jaguar was in second place for most of the race behind the Walkinshaw/[[Win Percy]] car. Goss and Hahne's job was made all the more difficult by the driver's seat of their car having completely broken at the base of the back. The seat first cracked during Hahne's first driving stint and broke completely when Goss returned to the car, giving both drivers very little support despite efforts by the team to hold it in place with cable ties to the roll cage. The team could have replaced the seat but felt they would have lost at least a lap in doing so and decided to soldier on, a decision ultimately justified. The #10 car took the lead on about lap 120 following a split oil line on the Walkinshaw/Percy car. Goss, unable to drive the car hard through the corners due to the broken seat, had to use the superior power of the V12 on Mountain and Conrod straights to keep up lap times, with both Peter Brock and [[Roberto Ravaglia]] (BMW) closing the gap to within 30 seconds. The chase effectively ended with Brock's engine failure on lap 160 allowing Goss to back off over the last 3 laps. Team owner Walkinshaw, who qualified on pole following the Top Ten, finished third with Win Percy, the pair crossing the finish line together.<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\"/>\n\nAfter Jaguar Rover Australia declined to help fund a return effort by TWR in [[1986 James Hardie 1000|1986]] Goss returned with his own privately entered XJ-S backed by [[Citibank Australia]] and co-driven by veteran [[Bob Muir (racing driver)|Bob Muir]]. After numerous problems in before and during qualifying including not passing scrutineering due to the liberal interpretation of the rear suspension pick up points and not having suitable size tyres, the pair started 26th, slower than the only other XJS in the race, a private effort driven by [[Garry Willmington]] and [[Peter Janson]]. Electrical troubles in the race resulting in a flat battery saw them complete 140 laps and finish 24th outright. Goss was involved in an incident on lap 2 of the race that took out the [[Roberto Ravaglia]] / [[Dieter Quester]] [[Schnitzer Motorsport|Schnitzer]] [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]] which resulted in Ravaglia physically attacking Goss from behind following the Jag's first pit stop. Despite being offered by the race stewards the chance to lay charges against Ravaglia for the incident, Goss refused to take the case any further believing it was just one of those things and that the [[Italian people|Italian]] was just caught up in the emotion of the moment. Goss later told [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] pit reporter [[Pat Welsh (sports journalist)|Pat Welsh]] (who had seen Ravaglia attack him) that he was \"astounded\" by what the Italian had done both on and off the track, though he did not elaborate on what took place in the pits.\n\n==1987-1990==\nGoss missed the [[1987 James Hardie 1000|1987]] [[1987 World Touring Car Championship|World Touring Car Championship]] round as well as the [[1988 Tooheys 1000|1988]] race but returned to drive for [[Glenn Seton Racing]] in [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]] in a [[Ford Sierra RS500]]. He paired with [[Glenn Seton]] for a fourth-placed finish at the [[1989 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]]. At the [[1989 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], Goss was teamed with [[Tony Noske]] in the team's second car, they were joined during the race by Seton after his own car had failed. After a troubled run the trio went on to finish 20th outright after the car started 17th.\n\nGoss' final Bathurst 1000 came in [[1990 Tooheys 1000|1990]] when he paired with fellow Sydney based veteran Phil Ward in a [[Phil Ward Racing]] [[Mercedes-Benz W201#190E 2.3-16 & 2.5-16 \"Cosworth\"|Mercedes-Benz 190E]] to finish 12th outright and a Division 2 class win after starting 38th. In contrast to his outright wins at Bathurst in 1974 and 1985, Goss' Div2 win with Ward was relatively straight forward as the Mercedes-Benz ran the race with no problems.<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\"/>\n\n==Career results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He is the only driver to have won Australia's two most prestigious races, the [[Bathurst 1000]] ([[1974 Bathurst 1000|1974]] and [[1985 James Hardie 1000|1985]]), and the [[Australian Grand Prix]] ([[1976 Australian Grand Prix|1976]]).<ref name=\"oamMS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/v8supercars/news/bathurst-winner-awarded-order-of-australia-medal-1045591/|title=Bathurst winner awarded Order of Australia medal|last=van Leeuwen|first=Andrew|date=11 June 2018|publisher=[[Motorsport.com]]|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring his career, John Goss gained a reputation for long acceptance speeches, with many joking that his victory speech on the Bathurst podium following his 1974 win took almost as long as the race itself (the race, the first to be run in wet conditions, lasted 7 hours, 51 minutes and 43 seconds).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-feature/the-legends-of-bathurst-65355|title=The legends of Bathurst|last=Melville|first=Ally|date=5 October 2017|publisher=[[Drive.com.au]]|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nGoss was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2018 for services to motorsport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.com/news/championship/bathurst-legend-receives-oam/|title=Bathurst legend receives OAM|last=Bartholomaeus|first=Stefan|date=11 June 2018|publisher=Supercars.com|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nHaving moved from Victoria to Tasmania as a child, Goss began racing in his adopted state in [[Holden FJ]]s and [[Ford Customline]]s.<ref name=primotipo/> He then built his own sports car, the Tornado [[Ford]], which he took to the mainland with some success, scoring points in the [[Australian Sports Car Championship]] in both [[1969 Australian Sports Car Championship|1969]] and [[1970 Australian Sports Car Championship|1970]]. He also raced [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon GTHOs]] in production car racing from 1969 and stayed loyal to Ford for much of his career.\n\n==McLeod Ford==\n\n===Series Production===\nGoss debuted at the Bathurst 500 in [[1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1969]] driving a McLeod Ford (with its distinctive yellow/black chequer windscreen strip) sponsored [[Ford XW Falcon|Ford Falcon GTHO]], but Goss's co-driver Dennis Cribbin crashed the Falcon at Forrest's Elbow.<ref name=\"oamMS\"/> In [[1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1970]] John Goss posted the fastest lap during the Bathurst 500 in his [[Ford XW Falcon|XW Falcon GTHO Phase II]]. The following year Goss won two rounds of the [[Toby Lee Series]] at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] against such opposition as [[Colin Bond]] and [[Fred Gibson (motor racing)|Fred Gibson]].\n\nGoss won the 1972 [[South Pacific Touring Series|South Pacific Touring Car Series]] and the [[1972 Sandown 250]] endurance race, both in [[Group E Series Production Touring Cars|Series Production]] [[Ford XY Falcon GT|Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase III's]]. He also put his Falcon on the front row of the grid at the [[1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500]], qualifying second fastest behind the [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Works GTHO]] of expat-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Allan Moffat]]. Engine failure after splashing around for 24 wet laps ended Goss' race.\n\n===Group C===\nWith the Series Production class being replaced by the new [[Group C (Australia)|Group C Touring Car]] class in 1973, Goss was the first driver to develop and race the new [[Ford XA Falcon|Ford Falcon XA GT Hardtop]]. Unlike Series Production, the new Group C rules allowed considerable modifications. Goss obtained sponsorship from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and continued his association with Max McLeod, a prominent Ford dealer (McLeod Ford) in [[Rockdale, New South Wales]] \u2013 known for his \"[[Horn car]]s\" \u2013 as well as obtaining factory assistance from [[Ford Australia]], who provided Goss with purpose-built XA racing chassis. Goss was actually the first to race the XA Hardtop in the [[1973 Australian Touring Car Championship|1973 ATCC]], even before the Works team who used a modified Phase III GTHO and didn't make the switch to the Hardtop until the [[1973 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|Endurance races]] later in the year. Goss and [[Kevin Bartlett (race driver)|Kevin Bartlett]] teamed up for the [[1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] at Bathurst and qualified on [[pole position]] with a time of 2:33.4 (it was to be Goss' only pole at Bathurst) ahead of the [[Holden Torana#LJ|GTR-XU1 Holden Torana]] of [[Peter Brock]] and [[Doug Chivas]]. Goss started and built up a good lead which was kept until he was involved in a crash at The Cutting which damaged his front end.<ref name=\"oamMS\"/> The Falcon suffered radiator damage which later caused its retirement on lap 110 of the now 163 lap race (prior to 1973, race distance was 500 miles and ran only 130 laps).\n\nThe pair returned to Bathurst for the [[1974 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] in the same car \u2013 repainted from yellow to blue after losing [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] as their major sponsor \u2013 and proved to have the reliability needed to last through a race marred by driving rain, finishing first.<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\">{{cite book | title=The official history of The Great Race Bathurst : 50 years | last1=Greenhalgh | first1=David | last2=Tuckey | first2=Bill | publisher=Chevron Publishing Group | year=2013 | isbn=9780980591231 | location=[[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]], [[New South Wales]]}}</ref> To celebrate the victory, [[Ford Australia]] released a limited edition [[Ford XB Falcon|XB Falcon Hardtop]] in 1975 called the [[John Goss Special]].  Actual production numbers of these cars were never released by Ford, but estimates range anywhere between 260 and 800 \u2013 they are now considered collectible.\n[[File:Falcongoss.jpg|thumb|left|John Goss's reproduction of the 1974 Bathurst winner]]\n[[File:Ford XB Falcon Hardtop John Goss Special.jpg|thumb|right|Ford XB Falcon GT Hardtop \"John Goss Special\"]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Formula 5000==\nGoss won the [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown Park]] round of the [[1975 Tasman Series]] and the [[1976 Australian Grand Prix]] at Sandown Park in Victoria, driving an Australian built [[Matich A53]] [[Repco Holden]] in both events.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps2MEP5Iu14 1976 Australian Grand Prix]</ref> In doing so he became the only driver to ever win both the [[Bathurst 1000]] and the [[Australian Grand Prix]]. During the mid-1970s Goss was concentrating his racing efforts more on the F5000 than his Croup C Falcons and ever loyal to Ford tried to run the A53 with a [[Ford 335 engine#302 Cleveland|5.0L Ford V8]] but the concept had little success.\n\n==Jaguar==\n\n===Group C===\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Goss registered three 'Did Not Finish' results at Bathurst driving Falcons with [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Henri Pescarolo]] as co-driver. In the [[1977 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] he ran a second team car for Australia's three time [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]] [[Jack Brabham]], and Jack's son [[Geoff Brabham|Geoff]].<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\"/>\n\nThen in 1980, Goss began campaigning a [[Jaguar V12 engine#5.3|V12]] powered [[Jaguar XJS]] at Bathurst, at first with no luck. In the [[1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1980 race]] he started what was basically a standard car from 58th on the grid, but lasted only 14 laps before retiring with gearbox failure. In [[1981 James Hardie 1000|1981]], he teamed with [[1965 Armstrong 500|1965]] winner [[Barry Seton]] in the XJS, and after an improved qualifying effort (19th), they weren't classified as finishers of the crash shortened race having completed only 73 of the 120 laps and being caught up in the crash on the top of the mountain. Goss returned with a better prepared effort in [[1982 James Hardie 1000|1982]], sharing the driving with [[United States|American]] [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] Jaguar [[Sports car racing|sports car]] race driver / team owner [[Bob Tullius]], who also assisted with technical info for the car and engine. Goss qualified the car 14th with a time of 2:22.3 (almost 5 seconds slower than pole sitter [[Allan Grice]] in a [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] [[Holden VH Commodore|Holden Commodore]], but some 5.7 seconds faster than he had achieved in 1981), but after a strong, consistent run, once again the big cat failed to finish following suspension failure on lap 119.\n\nGoss missed the [[1983 James Hardie 1000]], but returned in [[1984 James Hardie 1000|1984]] for the last year of Australia's Group C racing sharing a drive with [[Tom Walkinshaw]], team owner of the [[European Touring Car Championship]]s [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]]. Walkinshaw, who ran three factory backed [[Group A]] XJS' in the ETCC (and would go on to win that title in 1984), added a lot of technical assistance to the team with revised suspension and the use of one of TWR's own V12 engines. Despite trouble in qualifying with no suitable rear tyres arriving in time to use, the [[Scottish people|Scot]] qualified the car in 8th with a 2:16.09 lap (faster than Peter Brock's 1983 pole time), before falling to 10th in the Hardies Heroes top ten run-off with a 2:18.96, again due to unsuitable rear tyres. Walkinshaw also started the race never left the line. The Jags clutch had gone leaving Walkinshaw stranded with his arm out the window warning other drivers he was stationary. Before the race Walkinshaw had informed [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]], who was lined up behind him on that grid, that he wasn't confident of a quick start as the cars clutch was designed for the rolling starts used in the ETCC. Harvey took the precaution to line his [[Holden Dealer Team|HDT]] [[Holden VK Commodore|VK Commodore]] so that he could get around the slow starting Jag if needed, a tactic which allowed him to avoid the chaos that ensued. Unfortunately in the dust kicked up off the start, the [[Kevin Bartlett (racing driver)|Kevin Bartlett]] owned [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)#1979|Chevrolet Camaro]] of John Tesoriero was coming through at speed and could not avoid the #12 Jag, hitting it in the rear. The Camaro was then hit by the fast starting [[Toyota Supra#1984|Toyota Celica Supra]] of [[Peter Williamson (racing driver)|Peter Williamson]] causing a start line pile up. This caused the race to be stopped as the track was completely blocked by the three cars involved, with the back half of the field having to stop to avoid the incident. It would be the only time the race has ever been restarted in its history. While Goss later admitted that the team could have repaired the Jaguar and re-joined the race, the decision was made to withdraw the car as the repairs would have taken almost half the race.\n\n===Group A===\n[[File:John Goss 1985 Bathurst winning Jaguar XJS (14917976168).jpg|thumb|The 1980 [[Jaguar XJ-S]] John Goss repainted as a replica of the [[1985 James Hardie 1000]] race winner]]\nAustralian Touring Car racing changed to International Group A rules in [[1985 Australian Touring Car season|1985]], and Goss scored his second and last ourtight [[1985 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst win]] that year with [[West German]] co-driver [[Armin Hahne]] in one of a three-car assault on the Great Race by Tom Walkinshaw's TWR team using the 1984 ETCC-winning V12 Jaguar XJS' (Walkinshaw had been stung by the bad showing in 1984 and was determined to bring his own team back to conquer the race). Goss, installed by Walkinshaw as lead driver of the team's third car (#10), actually qualified fastest going into Hardies Heroes, giving lie to those who believed he was past his best as a driver and that Walkinshaw had made an error by having him drive. He ended up 6th in the Top Ten run-off after mistakes on both laps (1985 was the last year that cars were given two laps in Hardies Heroes).\n\nThe cars were held on the grid for a long time before the green flag was shown. This caused several cars, including the Goss Jaguar, to start overheating. To avoid this Goss actually turned the car off and only restarted it when the 30 second sign was shown, though the car was still overheating. Goss made a good start and for the opening laps was in a dice for 2nd with [[Allan Grice]] (Commodore), [[Robbie Francevic]] ([[Volvo 200 series#Motorsport|Volvo]]), [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] ([[Ford Mustang (third generation)#1983\u20131986|Ford Mustang]]), [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] ([[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]]) and [[Peter Brock]] (Commodore). First Francevic, then Goss, broke free of the dice. Once free of the dice, Goss would chase down and take second from the Volvo in less than 10 laps, giving Jaguar a 1-2 on the road for the first time since the early laps before the team's second car driven by [[Jeff Allam]] retired with engine failure. From then on, the Goss/Hahne Jaguar was in second place for most of the race behind the Walkinshaw/[[Win Percy]] car. Goss and Hahne's job was made all the more difficult by the driver's seat of their car having completely broken at the base of the back. The seat first cracked during Hahne's first driving stint and broke completely when Goss returned to the car, giving both drivers very little support despite efforts by the team to hold it in place with cable ties to the roll cage. The team could have replaced the seat but felt they would have lost at least a lap in doing so and decided to soldier on, a decision ultimately justified. The #10 car took the lead on about lap 120 following a split oil line on the Walkinshaw/Percy car. Goss, unable to drive the car hard through the corners due to the broken seat, had to use the superior power of the V12 on Mountain and Conrod straights to keep up lap times, with both Peter Brock and [[Roberto Ravaglia]] (BMW) closing the gap to within 30 seconds. The chase effectively ended with Brock's engine failure on lap 160 allowing Goss to back off over the last 3 laps. Team owner Walkinshaw, who qualified on pole following the Top Ten, finished third with Win Percy, the pair crossing the finish line together.<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\"/>\n\nAfter Jaguar Rover Australia declined to help fund a return effort by TWR in [[1986 James Hardie 1000|1986]] Goss returned with his own privately entered XJ-S backed by [[Citibank Australia]] and co-driven by veteran [[Bob Muir (racing driver)|Bob Muir]]. After numerous problems in before and during qualifying including not passing scrutineering due to the liberal interpretation of the rear suspension pick up points and not having suitable size tyres, the pair started 26th, slower than the only other XJS in the race, a private effort driven by [[Garry Willmington]] and [[Peter Janson]]. Electrical troubles in the race resulting in a flat battery saw them complete 140 laps and finish 24th outright. Goss was involved in an incident on lap 2 of the race that took out the [[Roberto Ravaglia]] / [[Dieter Quester]] [[Schnitzer Motorsport|Schnitzer]] [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]] which resulted in Ravaglia physically attacking Goss from behind following the Jag's first pit stop. Despite being offered by the race stewards the chance to lay charges against Ravaglia for the incident, Goss refused to take the case any further believing it was just one of those things and that the [[Italian people|Italian]] was just caught up in the emotion of the moment. Goss later told [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] pit reporter [[Pat Welsh (sports journalist)|Pat Welsh]] (who had seen Ravaglia attack him) that he was \"astounded\" by what the Italian had done both on and off the track, though he did not elaborate on what took place in the pits.\n\n==1987-1990==\nGoss missed the [[1987 James Hardie 1000|1987]] [[1987 World Touring Car Championship|World Touring Car Championship]] round as well as the [[1988 Tooheys 1000|1988]] race but returned to drive for [[Glenn Seton Racing]] in [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]] in a [[Ford Sierra RS500]]. He paired with [[Glenn Seton]] for a fourth-placed finish at the [[1989 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]]. At the [[1989 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], Goss was teamed with [[Tony Noske]] in the team's second car, they were joined during the race by Seton after his own car had failed. After a troubled run the trio went on to finish 20th outright after the car started 17th.\n\nGoss' final Bathurst 1000 came in [[1990 Tooheys 1000|1990]] when he paired with fellow Sydney based veteran Phil Ward in a [[Phil Ward Racing]] [[Mercedes-Benz W201#190E 2.3-16 & 2.5-16 \"Cosworth\"|Mercedes-Benz 190E]] to finish 12th outright and a Division 2 class win after starting 38th. In contrast to his outright wins at Bathurst in 1974 and 1985, Goss' Div2 win with Ward was relatively straight forward as the Mercedes-Benz ran the race with no problems.<ref name=\"50yrsbathurst\"/>\n\n==Career results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
