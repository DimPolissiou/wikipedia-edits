Benny and Bull go to meet with the District Attorney, but are surprised to find the case has been taken over by a zealous Federal prosecutor ([[Dana Delany]]). The defense learns that the doctor initially obtained the oil for her son, who has Leukemia.

This becomes difficult to prove, given that Kate rarely told anyone about the abuse and made only one trip to the emergency room, where she checked in under a false name. Danny and Cable are finally able to locate a teaching assistant that the husband cheated with. While the young woman was not abused herself, she did listen from another room as the husband fought with Kate and made threats.

Chunk reluctantly asks the law professor that failed him to testify that Miles does not fit the profile of the killer. After Danny and Cable do some legwork to narrow down the list of people who are likely the serial killer, Bull visits the prime suspect's wife, surmising she already knows the things her husband has done. The next day in court, an FBI agent visits the prosecutor's table, and the prosecutor then asks the judge that all charges against Miles be dropped.

After he turns up dead and she is accused of murdering him while drunk, Rachel hires TAC to defend her in court. The team grows concerned when they find evidence that Rachel has been acting emotionless and out of character, including going to work the same day she reported Peter missing and suffering from lapses of memory. It soon comes out that Rachel is suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which triggered her periodic memory loss and abnormal behaviour. The team finds previously overlooked evidence and a witness who testifies that Peter tried to kill Rachel by suffocating her with a plastic bag, and she killed him in self-defense. After she is found not guilty, Rachel, on Bull's request, resigns from her company and donates a substantial amount of her fortune toward Alzheimer's research. Meanwhile, Chunk continues to try to reconcile with Anna after she distances herself further from him. After sitting outside her dorm room for several hours, he manages to win her over by stating that while he may not be able to change her mind about her abortion, he will support her whatever she decides.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 74\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = Doctor Killer\n |DirectedBy      = [[Valerie Weiss]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Lawrence Kaplow|Larry Kaplow]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 407\n |Viewers         = 5.73<ref name=\"4.07\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-november-4-2019/|title='Dancing with the Stars' and 'The Good Doctor' adjust down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 5, 2019|accessdate=November 5, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Bull has a difficult time defending a client who has confessed to accidentally killing the doctor who tried an experimental treatment on his sister, only to later learn that the treatment had never been tested on humans.

The fence's gate was left unlocked, and the doctor plunged into a construction pit to his death. With the son now on trial, the prosecution tries to paint him as aggressive and having no remorse, leaving Chunk to work overtime preparing the teen. Meanwhile, Taylor does some digging and learns the doctor had been given a $500,000 advance from the pharma company to test the treatment on a human, and was only a week away from having to pay back the money due to the contract expiring.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 75\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = Safe and Sound\n |DirectedBy      = Glenn Gordon Caron\n |WrittenBy       = Pamela Wechsler\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|18}}\n |ProdCode        = 408\n |Viewers         = 5.78<ref name=\"4.08\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-november-18-2019/|title='Bull,' 'Dancing with the Stars,' and 'The Good Doctor' adjust down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 19, 2019|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Charlie Crawford, a 13-year old boy, convinces his older brother Theo to let him handle their father's handgun. After several clicks seem to confirm the gun is empty, Theo leaves the room. When Theo returns, Charlie aims and fires a bullet, killing his brother. The prosecution chooses to charge the father and Bull's friend from college, Eric, with negligent homicide after he admits he gave the gun safe combination to 17-year old Theo in case he ever needed protection. Eric says he frequently visited a shooting range with Theo and taught him safety, but video from their last visit reveals Eric did not check to make sure that the gun was empty on the way out. Eric swears on the stand that he fired six shots, so the gun was empty. Meanwhile, Bull deduces from hearing Charlie's 9-1-1 call and interviewing him that Charlie is likely a sociopath and incapable of empathy. Further investigation by the team reveals that Charlie researched online how to load a pistol and made systematic attempts to figure out the safe combination. After confirming attorney-client privilege, Charlie admits to Bull that he put the bullet in the gun. However, Bull and Benny still share this with the prosecution to get Eric's charges dropped, stating that Charlie committed perjury earlier in the trial which voids privilege.

The now-paralyzed boy's family sues the restaurant owners, who subsequently ask their liability insurance company to settle. TAC represents the insurance company after it becomes clear the boy jumped a locked fence and ignored no trespassing signs before making his climb. The plaintiff argues that the restaurant was holding a weekly contest for patrons to take a selfie with the restaurant prominently featured, and they encouraged unique and original photos. Before the case is final, the insurance company pulls out, declaring the policy null and void due to a technicality and leaving the mom-and-pop owners liable for damages.

The trial judge openly dislikes Bull due to a previous case, and forbids him from being in the courtroom. This forces Bull and Marissa to switch places. During the trial, the state tries to prove that the woman was actually the stalker. Taylor finds the man's cell phone and computers to be strangely clean, but after she and Danny find a hidden passage to the man's basement, they discover a high-tech gadget used to block outgoing signals.

While New York has passed a law removing the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases during a certain window, Bull and Benny say they cannot sue on behalf of the deceased. Stephen then reveals that he also was abused by Maybrook two years before his brother, and proposes to sue the billionaire himself.

When Bull and Benny go to see them, the parents decide to reject a $500,000 settlement and sue the school and coach for wrongful death, mainly because the mother wants to know why her son died. The defense points to enrollment paperwork and contends that Antonio's parents failed to disclose a heart condition he had as an infant, but the mother contends that doctors told them the condition was gone by the time Antonio was five years old. Knowing the defense paid a medical expert well known for appearing in court cases, Bull and the team look for any occasions where she testified that an infant mitral valve condition cannot cause a heart attack in teens. However, the expert crosses them up by testifying she found evidence that Antonio was taking amphetamines before his death. Chunk finds an email trail leading him to discover that Antonio confided with Reggie about his amphetamine use.

The wife, an old friend of Taylor's, requests TAC's help, as the fertility clinic they used made a mistake with the sperm. Bull rejects the $40,000 settlement offer from the clinic and negotiates for $1,000,000 for the couple, but they soon learn that the black man whose sample the clinic used is requesting custody of his biological son for him and his wife. In court, Benny states that the wealthy black couple work long hours and have been looking for nannies, while the black couple's lawyer points out that the white husband attends therapy weekly to seek help from his abusive childhood. When divorce papers the white wife filed a year prior come to light, she defends herself saying she was suffering from hormones and mood swings during her pregnancy, while the opposing lawyer interjects that the wife had dropped the divorce solely upon learning of her pregnancy. Finally, Danny researches the black couple and finds out that the black wife is in remission from cancer. A compassionate Bull comes up with a solution: the white wife gives one of her eggs to the black couple for their fertility treatment in exchange for both couples being given visitation time with each other's children.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 81\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n |Title           = Quid Pro Quo\n |DirectedBy      = Bethany Rooney\n |WrittenBy       = Pamela Wechsler\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|10}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = 6.31<ref name=\"4.14\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-10-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.10.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Dr. Samir Shadid, a successful heart surgeon who has saved numerous lives, is arrested and accused of knowing that his father paid a large sum to get him admitted to an exclusive university over ten years ago. Bull looks for jurors who believe in second chances, but the TAC team is forced to use their last available discretionary pick to choose between two jurors they don't want. Samir claims he was unaware of what his now-deceased father did. The middleman (actually a woman) who worked with the corrupt admissions officer claims Samir was present when his father made the payment, but Samir's mother swears on the stand that her son had no idea. During the trial, Bull is forced to leave when an overdue Izzy has pains, but it's false labor. The TAC team learns of a bribe being paid to a juror, which turns out to be from a lawyer who had also been accused of paying the same middleman and has an interest in the outcome.

Sarah, now 15 and known by the name Chloe Smith, has been raised by Elena as her daughter. Bull and Benny anticipate a difficult trial, given that there is no doubt Elena is guilty of the crime, so Bull hopes to select jurors who will see the act as a rescue instead of a kidnapping. Marissa proposes that Jim, now living in Florida with a new wife and 2-year old son, could still be abusive, so Danny goes to investigate. Danny finds evidence from the son's preschool that he's been abused, but the judge won't let Benny call any witnesses who did not see Jim abuse his wife or son first-hand.

While it's widely believed she sent the cards to prove that anthrax is still a threat, Reznick insists she's been framed. During the trial, which isn't going well, Marissa opens a card with Taylor nearby and a powdery substance explodes out, potentially contaminating both.

Bull's old friend from a battered women's clinic convinces him to help on the case, which isn't difficult given that Bull's late sister was also an abuse victim. Bull opts for an all-or-nothing defense, Murder 1 or acquittal, with no lesser charges being considered. Bull is convinced that, although her husband was sleeping at the time she killed him, Kate felt her life and that of her unborn child threatened on a daily basis. This becomes difficult to prove, given that Kate rarely told anyone about the abuse and made only one trip to the emergency room, where she checked in under a false name. Danny and Cable are finally able to locate a teaching assistant that the husband cheated with. While the young woman was not abused herself, she did listen from another room as the husband fought with Kate and made threats.

Bull takes Miles' risky case, and begins annoying his team with his tunnel vision. He ignores Marissa's advice on a juror, and later makes trial decisions without consulting Benny. Benny is able to refute one eyewitness's testimony, but the prosecution then brings in Elliott's pseudo-girlfriend to testify that he came home later than she originally told police.

Chunk reluctantly asks the law professor that failed him to testify that Miles does not fit the profile of the killer. After Danny and Cable do some legwork to narrow down the list of people who are likely the serial killer, Bull visits the prime suspect's wife, surmising she already knows the things her husband has done. The next day in court, an FBI agent visits the prosecutor's table, and the prosecutor then asks the judge that all charges against Miles be dropped.

But there is a twist: a few years ago, Lucas was briefly separated from his father for three weeks, and taken in by a Christian Foster family.

Bull and Benny face an uphill battle against an eager, young ADA when the victim is revealed to be an NYC firefighter.

Bull meets with the kids' mother, who insists that Bull do all he can to save her \"good son\", even if it means Brendan getting the death penalty. A witness eventually comes forward to corroborate Connor's story, but Marissa tells Bull the jury appears unmoved. Further, TAC learns that Brendan made a deal with the prosecution to avoid the death penalty in exchange for testifying against Connor. Brendan is killed in jail and can't testify, so Bull decides to put the father on the stand. The father vehemently testifies that Connor wouldn't hurt anyone.

Benny convinces the TAC team that he can make the case that alcohol didn't cause the shooting, rather, it had been planned well beforehand. Despite the team's best efforts, the jury is deadlocked for several days.

Sadie hires TAC to stop the sale, and initial evidence shows that Gerald did some shady things with his daughter's money. However, when Gerald's motives become clear, Bull and the team have to rethink their strategy.

The team grows concerned when they find evidence that Rachel has been acting emotionless and out of character, including going to work the same day she reported Peter missing and suffering from lapses of memory. It soon comes out that Rachel is suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which triggered her periodic memory loss and abnormal behaviour. The team finds previously overlooked evidence and a witness who testifies that Peter tried to kill Rachel by suffocating her with a plastic bag, and she killed him in self-defense. After she is found not guilty, Rachel, on Bull's request, resigns from her company and donates a substantial amount of her fortune toward Alzheimer's research.

The fence's gate was left unlocked, and the doctor plunged into a construction pit to his death. With the son now on trial, the prosecution tries to paint him as aggressive and having no remorse, leaving Chunk to work overtime preparing the teen.

After several clicks seem to confirm the gun is empty, Theo leaves the room. When Theo returns, Charlie aims and fires a bullet, killing his brother. The prosecution chooses to charge the father and Bull's friend from college, Eric, with negligent homicide after he admits he gave the gun safe combination to 17-year old Theo in case he ever needed protection. Eric says he frequently visited a shooting range with Theo and taught him safety, but video from their last visit reveals Eric did not check to make sure that the gun was empty on the way out. Eric swears on the stand that he fired six shots, so the gun was empty. Meanwhile, Bull deduces from hearing Charlie's 9-1-1 call and interviewing him that Charlie is likely a sociopath and incapable of empathy. Further investigation by the team reveals that Charlie researched online how to load a pistol and made systematic attempts to figure out the safe combination. After confirming attorney-client privilege, Charlie admits to Bull that he put the bullet in the gun. However, Bull and Benny still share this with the prosecution to get Eric's charges dropped, stating that Charlie committed perjury earlier in the trial which voids privilege.

The defense points to enrollment paperwork and contends that Antonio's parents failed to disclose a heart condition he had as an infant, but the mother contends that doctors told them the condition was gone by the time Antonio was five years old. Knowing the defense paid a medical expert well known for appearing in court cases, Bull and the team look for any occasions where she testified that an infant mitral valve condition cannot cause a heart attack in teens. However, the expert crosses them up by testifying she found evidence that Antonio was taking amphetamines before his death. Chunk finds an email trail leading him to discover that Antonio confided with Reggie about his amphetamine use. Reggie says Antonio did not want him to reveal his secret, but then says he did tell one person: Antonio's coach.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 80\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n |Title           = Child of Mine\n |DirectedBy      = Dennis Smith\n |WrittenBy       = Marissa Matteo\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|3}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = 6.47<ref name=\"4.13\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-3-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.3.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 4, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = A white couple is left confused after the wife gives birth to a brown baby. The wife, an old friend of Taylor's, requests TAC's help, as the fertility clinic they used made a mistake with the sperm. Bull rejects the $40,000 settlement offer from the clinic and negotiates for $1,000,000 for the couple, but they soon learn that the black man whose sample the clinic used is requesting custody of his biological son for him and his wife. In court, Benny states that the wealthy black couple work long hours and have been looking for nannies, while the black couple's lawyer points out that the white husband attends therapy weekly to seek help from his abusive childhood. When divorce papers the white wife filed a year prior come to light, she defends herself saying she was suffering from hormones and mood swings during her pregnancy, while the opposing lawyer interjects that the wife had dropped the divorce solely upon learning of her pregnancy. Finally, Danny researches the black couple and finds out that the black wife is in remission from cancer. A compassionate Bull comes up with a solution: the white wife gives one of her eggs to the black couple for their fertility treatment in exchange for both couples being given visitation time with each other's children.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 81\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n |Title           = Quid Pro Quo\n |DirectedBy      = Bethany Rooney\n |WrittenBy       = Pamela Wechsler\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|10}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = 6.31<ref name=\"4.14\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-10-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.10.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Dr. Samir Shadid, a successful heart surgeon who has saved numerous lives, is arrested and accused of knowing that his father paid a large sum to get him admitted to an exclusive university over ten years ago. Bull looks for jurors who believe in second chances, but the TAC team is forced to use their last available discretionary pick to choose between two jurors they don't want. Samir claims he was unaware of what his now-deceased father did. The middleman (actually a woman) who worked with the corrupt admissions officer claims Samir was present when his father made the payment, but Samir's mother swears on the stand that her son had no idea. During the trial, Bull is forced to leave when an overdue Izzy has pains, but it's false labor. The TAC team learns of a bribe being paid to a juror, which turns out to be from a lawyer who had also been accused of paying the same middleman and has an interest in the outcome. Bull shares this information with the prosecutor, and encourages her to drop the current case. As the court case closes, Izzy goes into labor for real, and gives birth to a daughter.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 82\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 15\n |Title           = Flesh and Blood\n |DirectedBy      = John Aronson\n |WrittenBy       = Kathryn Price & Nichole Millard\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|17}}\n |ProdCode        = \n |Viewers         = 6.22<ref name=\"4.15\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-17-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.17.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 19, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Vivian Cahill ([[Anna Wood (actress)|Anna Wood]]), an old college friend of Bull, is accused of murdering her verbally-abusive father, Terrence, in their home.

Sarah, now 15 and known by the name Chloe Smith, has been raised by Elena as her daughter. Bull and Benny anticipate a difficult trial, given that there is no doubt Elena is guilty of the crime, so Bull hopes to select jurors who will see the act as a rescue instead of a kidnapping. Marissa proposes that Jim, now living in Florida with a new wife and 2-year old son, could still be abusive, so Danny goes to investigate. Danny finds evidence from the son's preschool that he's been abused, but the judge won't let Benny call any witnesses who did not see Jim abuse his wife or son first-hand.

The letters were sent shortly after federal funding was cut for the research Reznick's department conducts. While it's widely believed she sent the cards to prove that anthrax is still a threat, Reznick insists she's been framed. During the trial, which isn't going well, Marissa opens a card with Taylor nearby and a powdery substance explodes out, potentially contaminating both. It turns out to be powdered sugar, likely sent by someone who is angry with TAC for defending \"Dr. Anthrax\".

It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival.

Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films.

He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]].

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design. He felt that this would give more impact to the large-scale elements of the film, and help it be more emotional, comparing this idea to the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 28, 2017, in [[Montreal]], Quebec,<ref name=\"FormalizedPlans\" /><ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Teen Spirit''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Mauro Fiore]] served as cinematographer.<ref name=\"Fiore\" /> Filming primarily took place at MELS Studios.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> Before the end of the month, [[Evan Peters]] was set to reprise his role as \"audience favorite\" character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] from the previous films, and [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"PetersJohnson\" /> At the start of August, Chastain confirmed her involvement in the film;<ref name=\"ChastainConfirmed\" /> she was interested in the story, after turning down roles in other superhero films, due to its focus on female characters.<ref name=\"XWomen\" /> Kinberg said he wanted the film to be \"human\" and emotional like previous ''X-Men'' films, and that he was looking to ground the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" story for his adaptation \"so it's not too intergalactic.\"<ref name=\"KinbergTFAug2017\" /> He later clarified that the film would still include alien characters as in the comic storyline, an element that was ignored for the ''Last Stand'' adaptation but which he felt was integral to the story.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /><ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" /> He also said that the film would tonally be less operatic than previous ''X-Men'' films, which he hoped would make it more relatable for audiences.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /> By September, [[Daniel Cudmore]] had stated that he would be appearing in the film, but could not confirm whether he would be reprising his role as [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] from previous films in the franchise.<ref name=\"CudmoreSep2017\" /> Chastain revealed that she was not actually playing Lilandra.<ref name=\"NoLilandra\" /> While [[Olivia Munn]] had initially said that she would reprise her role as [[Psylocke]]<!-- , and described ''Dark Phoenix'' as \"a two parter\" -->,<ref name=\"Munn\" /> by February 2019, she revealed that she was unable to reprise her role due to scheduling conflicts with filming ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]''.<ref name=\"NoPsylocke\" /> Filming was completed on October 14, 2017.<ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2017, Kinberg revealed that the film would be in post-production for almost a year, longer than usual for the series, because he wanted to take the time to have the visual effects look right by focusing on the \"nuance\" of the effects rather than the scale.<ref name=\"EWVisuals\" /> He also explained that he \"felt in his gut\" that this was the story that he needed to tell once Singer left the franchise, and that his vision for the film was \"so clear in my head, emotionally and visually, that it would have killed me to hand this to somebody else to direct.\" The film was described as being the most sinister and somber of the franchise, with McAvoy finding it to be the most emotional of the ''X-Men'' films he had worked on. It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.

and later released on home media as '''''X-Men: Dark Phoenix''''') is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men]] characters. It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival. Magneto has formed a community of mutant refugees on the island of [[Genosha]],<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> which Kinberg compared to [[Israel]] in it being a homeland where mutants can be safe.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven / Mystique]]: <br />A shape-shifting mutant and Xavier's adopted sister. Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]]. Peters described the character as more mature and subdued in the film, being focused on using his abilities for good as a member of the X-Men.<ref name=\"PetersSRMay2018\" />\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler]]: <br />A German mutant who can teleport.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Vuk:<br />The leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]] who manipulates the Phoenix. Kinberg described her as \"the devil on Jean's shoulder,\"<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> while Chastain called her character \"clinical.\"<ref name=\"EWChastain\" /> Chastain also plays Margaret Smith, the woman Vuk impersonates.\n* [[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]] as John Grey\n* [[Ato Essandoh]] as Jones, Vuk's second in command.\n* [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Halston Sage]] as [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] in the character's first cinematic appearance.<ref name=\"40Years\" />\n* [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] as [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]]\n\nAdditionally, Kota Eberhardt portrays telepath [[Selene (comics)|Selene Gallio]], while [[Andrew Stehlin]] portrays Ariki, a mutant who can utilize his hair braids as a weapon.

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story, as hinted by Olivia Munn in an interview with Collider in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' later confirmed this initial approach.

At that time, Chastain was in talks to join the cast as Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], the film's villain.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design. He felt that this would give more impact to the large-scale elements of the film, and help it be more emotional, comparing this idea to the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 28, 2017, in [[Montreal]], Quebec,<ref name=\"FormalizedPlans\" /><ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Teen Spirit''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Mauro Fiore]] served as cinematographer.<ref name=\"Fiore\" /> Filming primarily took place at MELS Studios.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> Before the end of the month, [[Evan Peters]] was set to reprise his role as \"audience favorite\" character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] from the previous films, and [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"PetersJohnson\" /> At the start of August, Chastain confirmed her involvement in the film;<ref name=\"ChastainConfirmed\" /> she was interested in the story, after turning down roles in other superhero films, due to its focus on female characters.<ref name=\"XWomen\" /> Kinberg said he wanted the film to be \"human\" and emotional like previous ''X-Men'' films, and that he was looking to ground the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" story for his adaptation \"so it's not too intergalactic.\"<ref name=\"KinbergTFAug2017\" /> He later clarified that the film would still include alien characters as in the comic storyline, an element that was ignored for the ''Last Stand'' adaptation but which he felt was integral to the story.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /><ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" /> He also said that the film would tonally be less operatic than previous ''X-Men'' films, which he hoped would make it more relatable for audiences.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /> By September, [[Daniel Cudmore]] had stated that he would be appearing in the film, but could not confirm whether he would be reprising his role as [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] from previous films in the franchise.<ref name=\"CudmoreSep2017\" /> Chastain revealed that she was not actually playing Lilandra.<ref name=\"NoLilandra\" /> While [[Olivia Munn]] had initially said that she would reprise her role as [[Psylocke]]<!-- , and described ''Dark Phoenix'' as \"a two parter\" -->,<ref name=\"Munn\" /> by February 2019, she revealed that she was unable to reprise her role due to scheduling conflicts with filming ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]''.<ref name=\"NoPsylocke\" /> Filming was completed on October 14, 2017.<ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2017, Kinberg revealed that the film would be in post-production for almost a year, longer than usual for the series, because he wanted to take the time to have the visual effects look right by focusing on the \"nuance\" of the effects rather than the scale.<ref name=\"EWVisuals\" /> He also explained that he \"felt in his gut\" that this was the story that he needed to tell once Singer left the franchise, and that his vision for the film was \"so clear in my head, emotionally and visually, that it would have killed me to hand this to somebody else to direct.\" The film was described as being the most sinister and somber of the franchise, with McAvoy finding it to be the most emotional of the ''X-Men'' films he had worked on. It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung |last=[[Robert Koch-Institut]] |date=4 March 2020 |language=de |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* Reduce morbidity and mortality\n* Ensure treatment of infected persons\n* Upkeep of essential public services\n* Short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* Containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* Protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* Mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.
