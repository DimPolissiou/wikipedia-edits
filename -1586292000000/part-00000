He has been hiding from the FBI for over thirty years, establishing an identity as a defense attorney near [[Albany, New York]]. When Sharon Solarz ([[Susan Sarandon]]), another former Weather Underground member, is arrested on October 3, 2011, an ambitious young reporter, Ben Shepard ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), smells an opportunity to make a name for himself with a national story. His prickly editor, Ray Fuller ([[Stanley Tucci]]), assigns him to follow up. Ben's ex-girlfriend, Diana ([[Anna Kendrick]]), is an FBI agent, and he presses her for information about the case. She tells him to look up a Billy Cusimano ([[Stephen Root]]). Billy, an old hippie with a history of drug arrests who runs an organic grocery, is an old friend of Sharon Solarz and a former client of Jim's. Billy is disappointed that Jim doesn't want to take Sharon's case, and he conveys this information to Ben when Ben questions him.\n\nBen pursues Jim and tries to question him, but Jim is evasive. Spooked by the federal investigation, Jim takes his 11-year-old daughter Isabel ([[Jackie Evancho]]) on \"a little trip\", driving north at first to throw off his pursuers. Ben learns that Mimi Lurie ([[Julie Christie]]), an accomplice in the Michigan bank robbery, was last seen in Canada. A private investigator helps Ben find out that Jim had no Social Security number prior to 1979 and finds a copy of Jim Grant's California death certificate. Ben concludes that Jim is really Nick Sloan, another former Weatherman, and writes an article breaking this news, creating a sensation and accelerating the FBI's interest.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim and Isabel arrive in New York City. They go sight-seeing and check into a fancy hotel. The manhunt for Jim/Nick is now national news. While Isabel is sleeping, Jim leaves the room key hidden in the hotel lobby, where his brother, Daniel Sloan ([[Chris Cooper]]), retrieves it. FBI agents, under the direction of Diana's boss Cornelius ([[Terrence Howard]]), have been tracking Daniel and follow him to the hotel. They nearly catch Jim there, but Jim creates a diversion and escapes. Sharon Solarz refuses to provide any information to the FBI, but she agrees to talk to Ben. She is unrepentant about her radical activism in the Weather Underground; she reveals that Nick and Mimi had a love affair long ago. Ben also questions Daniel and writes a gratuitously unflattering piece about him, annoying Ben's boss.\n\nJim/Nick goes to [[Milwaukee]] to find Donal ([[Nick Nolte]]), his old best friend, who now owns a lumber yard. Donal discourages him from looking for Mimi, but tells him to contact former [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] member, history professor Jed Lewis ([[Richard Jenkins]]). Jed resents the Weather Underground's role in splintering the antiwar left. He initially refuses to help Jim, but when he finds out that Jim has a young daughter, he uses his connections with their old radical friends to track down Mimi. At [[Big Sur]], California, Mimi imports marijuana into the U.S. aboard a sailboat as part of a big operation run by Mac McLeod ([[Sam Elliott]]), Mimi's boyfriend. Through Jed, Jim reaches Mac, who informs him that Mimi left to go \"inland\". Jim knows where she is going.\n\nBen begins to feel that Jim's actions make no sense for a guilty man. Defying his boss, he goes to Michigan to investigate the original crime. He meets with retired cop Henry Osborne ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), who was the first person to investigate the robbery. Osborne refuses to talk in front of his adopted daughter Rebecca ([[Brit Marling]]), and Ben realizes that he is hiding something important. Ben does some research, finding that Osborne had strong connections to Mimi's family before the bank robbery. He learns of the Linder-Lurie company property on the Michigan [[upper peninsula]] near Ontario, Canada. Osborne acknowledges that if Mimi were to come forward with the information that Jim was not present at the robbery (although Jim's car was used during it), Jim would be cleared of all charges. Later, Ben flirts with Osborne's daughter Rebecca.\n\nJim and Mimi meet in a secluded cabin on the Linder-Lurie property; she is still passionate about the goals of the Weathermen and unapologetic about her actions 30 years earlier, but Jim argues that life has changed. Jim asks Mimi to turn herself in and confirm his alibi, for the sake of his daughter, Isabel. He doesn't want to leave Isabel behind and repeat the mistake that he and Mimi made 30 years earlier by giving up their own daughter. Mimi reveals that she saw their daughter recently in [[Ann Arbor]], and that she is a beautiful young woman now. Meanwhile, Ben realizes that Jim is searching for Mimi, who can clear him of the charges, and that Rebecca is their daughter. He tells Rebecca to speak to her father.\n\nThe next morning, Mimi flees the cabin to sail to Canada just as Ben arrives at the Linder-Lurie property to find Jim. Ben tells Jim that he knows the truth about Rebecca and Osborne; Jim says that Ben must now decide whether to reveal it or keep the secret. Jim leaves the cabin so that the FBI will chase him instead of Mimi. Cornelius catches Jim, and soon afterwards Rebecca learns of the circumstances of her adoption. Meanwhile, Mimi turns her boat around and returns to the U.S. to give herself up. The next day, Jim is freed from jail and reunites with Isabel. Ben decides not to expose Osborne's actions of 30 years before and to protect Rebecca's true identity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Jim Grant/Nick Sloan, a former member of the Weather Underground and widowed father posing as an upstanding Albany lawyer\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Ben Shepard, a reporter\n* [[Julie Christie]] as Mimi Lurie, a former member of the Weather Underground\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Sharon Solarz, a former member of the Weather Underground\n* [[Jackie Evancho]] as Isabel Grant, Jim's 11-year-old daughter, who is unaware of her father's past\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Henry Osborne, the officer who had first investigated the bank robbery for which Grant is wanted\n* [[Brit Marling]] as Rebecca Osborne, Henry's adopted daughter\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Diana, an FBI agent, who had dated Ben and leaks information to him\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Cornelius, the FBI agent leading the chase\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Jed Lewis, a college professor with links to the former radicals\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Donal Fitzgerald, Jim's old best friend who owns a lumber business\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Daniel Sloan, Nick Sloan's brother\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Mac Mcleod, Mimi's boss in the marijuana trade\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Billy Cusimano, who runs an organic grocery store in Albany\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Ray Fuller, Ben's boss at the newspaper\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Jim Grant's secretary\n\n==Production and distribution==\nProduced by [[Nicolas Chartier]] ([[Voltage Pictures]]), Redford and Bill Holderman,<ref name=McClintock1>McClintock, Pamela.

While Isabel is sleeping, Jim leaves the room key hidden in the hotel lobby, where his brother, Daniel Sloan ([[Chris Cooper]]), retrieves it. FBI agents, under the direction of Diana's boss Cornelius ([[Terrence Howard]]), have been tracking Daniel and follow him to the hotel. They nearly catch Jim there, but Jim creates a diversion and escapes. Sharon Solarz refuses to provide any information to the FBI, but she agrees to talk to Ben. She is unrepentant about her radical activism in the Weather Underground; she reveals that Nick and Mimi had a love affair long ago. Ben also questions Daniel and writes a gratuitously unflattering piece about him, annoying Ben's boss.\n\nJim/Nick goes to [[Milwaukee]] to find Donal ([[Nick Nolte]]), his old best friend, who now owns a lumber yard. Donal discourages him from looking for Mimi, but tells him to contact former [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] member, history professor Jed Lewis ([[Richard Jenkins]]). Jed resents the Weather Underground's role in splintering the antiwar left. He initially refuses to help Jim, but when he finds out that Jim has a young daughter, he uses his connections with their old radical friends to track down Mimi. At [[Big Sur]], California, Mimi imports marijuana into the U.S. aboard a sailboat as part of a big operation run by Mac McLeod ([[Sam Elliott]]), Mimi's boyfriend. Through Jed, Jim reaches Mac, who informs him that Mimi left to go \"inland\". Jim knows where she is going.\n\nBen begins to feel that Jim's actions make no sense for a guilty man. Defying his boss, he goes to Michigan to investigate the original crime. He meets with retired cop Henry Osborne ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), who was the first person to investigate the robbery. Osborne refuses to talk in front of his adopted daughter Rebecca ([[Brit Marling]]), and Ben realizes that he is hiding something important. Ben does some research, finding that Osborne had strong connections to Mimi's family before the bank robbery. He learns of the Linder-Lurie company property on the Michigan [[upper peninsula]] near Ontario, Canada. Osborne acknowledges that if Mimi were to come forward with the information that Jim was not present at the robbery (although Jim's car was used during it), Jim would be cleared of all charges. Later, Ben flirts with Osborne's daughter Rebecca.\n\nJim and Mimi meet in a secluded cabin on the Linder-Lurie property; she is still passionate about the goals of the Weathermen and unapologetic about her actions 30 years earlier, but Jim argues that life has changed. Jim asks Mimi to turn herself in and confirm his alibi, for the sake of his daughter, Isabel. He doesn\u2019t want to leave Isabel behind and repeat the mistake that he and Mimi made 30 years earlier by giving up their own daughter. Mimi reveals that she saw their daughter recently in [[Ann Arbor]], and that she is a beautiful young woman now. Meanwhile, Ben realizes that Jim is searching for Mimi, who can clear him of the charges, and that Rebecca is their daughter. He tells Rebecca to speak to her father.\n\nThe next morning, Mimi flees the cabin to sail to Canada just as Ben arrives at the Linder-Lurie property to find Jim. Ben tells Jim that he knows the truth about Rebecca and Osborne; Jim says that Ben must now decide whether to reveal it or keep the secret. Jim leaves the cabin so that the FBI will chase him instead of Mimi. Cornelius catches Jim, and soon afterwards Rebecca learns of the circumstances of her adoption. Meanwhile, Mimi turns her boat around and returns to the U.S. to give herself up. The next day, Jim is freed from jail and reunites with Isabel. Ben decides not to expose Osborne's actions of 30 years before and to protect Rebecca's true identity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Jim Grant/Nick Sloan, a former member of the Weather Underground and widowed father posing as an upstanding Albany lawyer\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Ben Shepard, a reporter\n* [[Julie Christie]] as Mimi Lurie, a former member of the Weather Underground\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Sharon Solarz, a former member of the Weather Underground\n* [[Jackie Evancho]] as Isabel Grant, Jim's 11-year-old daughter, who is unaware of her father's past\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Henry Osborne, the officer who had first investigated the bank robbery for which Grant is wanted\n* [[Brit Marling]] as Rebecca Osborne, Henry's adopted daughter\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Diana, an FBI agent, who had dated Ben and leaks information to him\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Cornelius, the FBI agent leading the chase\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Jed Lewis, a college professor with links to the former radicals\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Donal Fitzgerald, Jim's old best friend who owns a lumber business\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Daniel Sloan, Nick Sloan's brother\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Mac Mcleod, Mimi's boss in the marijuana trade\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Billy Cusimano, who runs an organic grocery store in Albany\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Ray Fuller, Ben's boss at the newspaper\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Jim Grant's secretary\n\n==Production and distribution==\nProduced by [[Nicolas Chartier]] ([[Voltage Pictures]]), Redford and Bill Holderman,<ref name=McClintock1>McClintock, Pamela.

The city has the largest high school in Denmark, [[Education in Denmark|N\u00e6stved Gymnasium & HF]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Naestved1600.20090723(020).jpg|thumb|Diorama inside the N\u00e6stved Museum showing N\u00e6stved as it appeared circa 1600.]]\n\nN\u00e6stved has roots as far back as 400-500 BC. Archaeological material from this period has been found in the soil under N\u00e6stved, and tells of human life here long before the [[Viking Age|Viking era]].\n\nThe name of the city, N\u00e6stved, derives from two words: N\u00e6s and Tved. Tved means \"cleared land\" or \"cleared wood\" (as \"thwaite\" in English toponyms), and refers to the city's origin in the woods of southern Zealand, on the banks of the [[Sus\u00e5 River|Sus\u00e5]]. \"N\u00e6s\" is the Danish word for a small peninsula (as \"ness\" in English toponyms), and probably refers to the city's placing on the peninsulas Ydern\u00e6s, Grimstrup N\u00e6s, and Appen\u00e6s.\n\nIn 1135, [[Benedictine]] monks received Saint Peter's Church and surrounding land in order to found [[St. Peter's Priory]]. This is seen as the foundation of the town of N\u00e6stved, although the town appears to have existed already at that time, being both big and important to the region.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Valdemar Atterdag.jpg|thumb|[[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar IV of Denmark (Valdemar Atterdag)]] shown on a [[fresco]] in Saint Peter's Church in N\u00e6stved ''(Sankt Peders Kirke)''.]]\nN\u00e6stved has various museums, concert-venues, theaters and exhibitions of all kinds during the year.\n\n===Churches===\n[[File:Skt. Mortens Kirke - N\u00e6stved.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church]]\nN\u00e6stved has five [[Danish National Church]]es: [[St. Martin's Church (N\u00e6stved)|St. Martin's Church]]<!--Sankt Mortens Kirke-->, [[St. Peter's Church, N\u00e6stved|St. Peter's Church]]<!--Sankt Peder Kirke, which is known for its [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[chancel]] and its [[baroque]] furnishings-->, [[Saint John's Church (N\u00e6stved)|Saint John's Church]]<!--Sankt J\u00f8rgens Kirke-->, [[Herlufsholm Church]], and [[Holsted Church]].  There are other churches in the town, such as Sj\u00f8lundkirken.  <!-- If it more religious than other places in Denmark, maybe that should be clarified.  Otherwise, maybe a little information about what else characterizes N\u00e6stved today, would be in order [[Herlufsholm School|Herlufsholm kostskole]]-->\n\n===Music and stage arts===\nGr\u00f8nnegades Kaserne Kulturcenter was opened in 2002 in what used to be [[Barracks|military barracks]]. It is in the center of the city, only five minutes walk away from the station. Denmark's top artists perform here, along with various names from abroad. Amongst the best-known foreign artists to have visited N\u00e6stved over the last few years are [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Beth Hart]], Runrig and [[Modern Talking]].\n\nIn recent years, various theatres have emerged in N\u00e6stved, culminating with the creation of an \"Egns Teater\" - a local theatre - in 2006. Performances by talented local artists add to N\u00e6stved's position as a cultural stronghold on Zealand outside Copenhagen.\n\n\"Studenternes Hus\" downtown (House of Students) is also a widely known and frequently used venue for local and national acts, as well as mid-range artistes from abroad. Cheap entry fees and a relaxed atmosphere attract a young crowd.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Helligaandshuset Naestved.jpg|thumb|Hellig\u00e5ndshuset housing N\u00e6stved Museum]]\nN\u00e6stved has a range of museums of local importance. In the city centre, N\u00e6stved Museum offers the full story of N\u00e6stved - from the very first settlements till this day. In Stenboderne, near [[St. Peter's Church (N\u00e6stved)|St. Peter's Church]], a collection of ancient findings are on show, including pottery, armory and more.\n\n[[N\u00e6stved Museum]] has exhibits covering the development of [[K\u00e4hler Keramik|K\u00e4hler Ceramics]] and [[Holmegaard Glass Factory|Holmegaard Glass]]. It is open to visitors every day except Monday. There are also interesting exhibits on textiles, toys and silverware. The museum consists of two separate buildings: Hellig\u00e5ndshuset on Ringstedgade to the north of the central square and Boderne on Sct. Peters Kirkeplads to the southwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aabne-samlinger.dk/naestved/english/|title=N\u00e6stved Museum|publisher=N\u00e6stved Museum|accessdate=20 November 2012 |language=}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nOn 1 January 2007, the size and population of the municipality of N\u00e6stved increased, as the government decided to merge four smaller municipalities with the municipality of N\u00e6stved. N\u00e6stved emerged with nearby Fuglebjerg, Flads\u00e5, Holmegaard and Sus\u00e5, increasing population in the municipality of N\u00e6stved to more than 80.000. That made N\u00e6stved the second-largest town on Zealand, only outranked by the capital, Copenhagen.\n\nExperienced mayor, Henning Jensen, led the city through the merger, and stayed head of the city council, with the four mayors from the other merged municipalities taking place as members of the council. Henning Jensen remained mayor of N\u00e6stved until 2011.\n\n===Political history===\nTraditionally, the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] has had the majority of seats in the City Council of N\u00e6stved. Today, they also have the most seats (\u2153 of the seats with support from other leftist parties).\n\nThe mayors of the town have been. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10em;\" | Name\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10em;\" | Political party\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:19em;\" | Period\n|-\n| [[Henning Jensen (born 1946)|Henning Jensen]]\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]\n| 2007 (1988)- May 2011\n|-\n| [[Carsten Rasmussen]]\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]\n| May 2011 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" rowspan=\"2\"|'''Political party'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" colspan=\"5\" |'''Seats'''\n|-\n|[[2001 Danish local elections|2001]]<ref>[http://www.kmdvalg.dk/kv/2001/kp421373.htm N\u00e6stved Kommune.

Later on Finland also became part of the network, with Iceland and the independent regions of \u00c5land, Greenland and [[Faroe Islands]] to follow.\n\nN\u00e6stved entered the project in 1947.\n\nN\u00e6stved's Cities of Friendship as per 1.1.2007:\n* [[Gj\u00f8vik]] - [[Norway]]\n* [[G\u00e4vle]] - [[Sweden]]\n* [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] - [[Finland]]\n* [[Bessastadahreppur]] - [[Iceland]]\n\n==Shopping==\n\n===N\u00e6stved Stor Center===\nIn 1989, a large [[shopping mall]] was established on what was then the outskirts of the city. The mall is called N\u00e6stved Storcenter (''N\u00e6stved Big Center''), and houses over 80 shops. Clothing, [[Danish design]] and much more can be found here. The center also offers seven restaurants of various kinds, from [[Mexican cuisine]] to pizzas, and hamburgers. People from most of Zealand come here to shop, and the large warehouse, BILKA, attracts a lot of customers.\n\nN\u00e6stved Storcenter is on the outer edge of the city, and is easily accessible by bus (from N\u00e6stved Station) and by train (N\u00e6stved Nord Station is a five-minute walk from the mall entrance).\n\n===N\u00e6stved Mega Center===\nJust next to N\u00e6stved Storcenter you will find N\u00e6stved Mega Center, which, though, in comparison is rather small. N\u00e6stved Megacenter is home for approx. 10 large stores offering everything from electronics to baby-wear.\n\n===N\u00e6stved City Centre===\nThe heart of the city has a large [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian area]] for a place of its size.\n\nEvery Wednesday and Saturday there's a market in the city centre on \"Axeltorv\" (Axle Square) - a very old square, dating back to the founding of the city.<ref>http://www.visitnaestved.com/ln-int/south-sealand/shopping-naestved</ref>\n\nN\u00e6stved has always been a hub of trade and commerce. Even before the year 1274 N\u00e6stved enjoyed the status of being a royal market town, and the market square itself predates 1140. The two names \u2013 Axeltorv (\u201cAxle Square\u201d) and Hjultorv (\u201cWheel Square\u201d) \u2013 tell us that the market wares arrived and were sold on wheels. \nToday, N\u00e6stved is known for its shopping centres and an attractive town environment full of specialist shops. Market days are still held on Axeltorv Wednesday and Saturday every week, and every year the town centre holds its own \u201cCity Night\u201d (mostly held on Fridays). This event often features music and other kinda of Entertainment, the shops stay open late until 10pm.\n\n==Industries==\n''(This section needs development)''\n\nNear the sea, with the harbour in the city centre, N\u00e6stved was traditionally a city of industry. In recent years, though, industry in the city centre has decreased, as production has moved to the outskirts of the city - primarily on ''Ydern\u00e6s''.\n\nAmong the companies in N\u00e6stved are [[Emerson Electric]] and Ropox A/S.\n\n===Novenco===\nN\u00e6stved's largest industry. Novenco develop and manufacture heating, ventilation, [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]] and refrigeration [[solution]]s for land and marine applications, along with numerous other products including [[Firefighter|fire-fighting]] products and systems.\n\nIn 1999 Novenco was sold to [[Johnson Controls|York International]] Inc., and had its name changed to York Novenco. In 2006, however, York Novenco was acquired by Dania Capital (a Danish [[investment company]]), who changed its name back to Novenco once again.\n\n===Ardagh Glass===\nThe major glass bottle company Based in Fensmark Is the largest private employer in the municipality with about 400 employees manufacturing bottles for soft drinks and beers among its most common products. It is part of the Irish Ardagh Group and until recently the fears was that the factory would be closed due to economic issues that today have been resolved and the factory is doing well again.\n\n==Media==\n''(This section needs improvement)''\n\nN\u00e6stved has numerous local media, from newspapers to daily [[Broadcasting|television broadcasts]]. Media company \"Sj\u00e6llandske Medier\" (Zealandic Media) has its headquarters in downtown N\u00e6stved, and runs a local as well as a regional newspaper called ''Ugeavisen N\u00e6stved'' and ''Sj\u00e6llandkse''. Sj\u00e6llandske Medier also operates a local TV-station called \"24Sj\u00e6llandske\", offering [[local news]] [[24/7|twenty-four-seven]].\n\nThe national Danish broadcasting company [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] has its department covering [[Region Zealand]].\n\n==Urban life==\nOver the last 10 years, N\u00e6stved has developed into a more lively city than before. The trend of going out to caf\u00e9s struck N\u00e6stved in the beginning of this century, and today, the town offers several caf\u00e9s in the City Centre.\n\nAlso, the population has increased heavily, and actually N\u00e6stved is the second fastest growing city in Denmark, only out-performed by Denmark's second largest city [[Aarhus]]. More people means more ideas, and that shows in N\u00e6stved, where new galleries, workshops and the like have been established in recent years.\n\nThe traffic in down-town N\u00e6stved can be very congested at times. New roads around the city has solved part of this problem, but the traffic can still be heavy, specially around 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nThe city received a new library in 2005, just beside another new institution: Gr\u00f8nnegade Cultural Center in the center of N\u00e6stved.\n\n==Attractions==\nN\u00e6stved and the surrounding area offer a wide variety of attractions for all ages. The town is especially rich in [[Medieval architecture]]; [[Old Town Hall (N\u00e6stved)|Old Town Hall]] is from about 1450, [[Hellig\u00e5ndshuset i N\u00e6stved]] dates around 1500, [[Boderne (N\u00e6stved)|Boderne]] is terraced buildings which have contained shops, and the oldest are from about 1400, [[Kompagnihuset]] is from 1493 and the two timber framed buildings Apostelhuset and Ridderhuset is both the beginning for the 1600th century.\n\nThe local museum, [[N\u00e6stved Museum]], is housed in Hellig\u00e5ndshuset and offers en exhibition of [[archeological]] findings from N\u00e6stved and the nearby area from the stone ages until moderne times.\n\n===Sus\u00e5===\nThe [[Sus\u00e5 River]] is Denmark's third longest river and flows through N\u00e6stved. After the demolition of a huge [[parking lot]] above it, the Sus\u00e5 has recently become more visible in the city. The Sus\u00e5 is surrounded on both sides by the Herlufsholm Forrest from the city center to Herlufsholm. Visitors are able to walk down both sides of the Sus\u00e5, and enjoy both the forest, the river, and [[Herlufsholm School|Herlufsholm Boarding school]].\n\nFishing and canoeing are allowed on the river.\n\n===BonBon Land===\nN\u00e6stved is home to the [[amusement park]] [[BonBon-Land]] located at Holme Olstrup, just 10 minutes from the city center. The park has increased dramatically in size over recent years, and was in 2012 among the 20 most visited sights in all of Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/sites/default/files/vdk_images/PDF-and-other-files/Analyser/2013/visitdenmark_attraktionslisten_2012.pdf|title=List of the 50 most visited Danish attractions (2012), visitdenmark.dk|author=|date=|website=visitdenmark.dk}}</ref>\n\nRecently, a new feature has been added to the amusement park in Holme Olstrup. It is called [[Fantasy world|Fantasy World]], and used to be located in Ringsted. It has now been bought by BonBon Land, and is located immediately next to it. Fantasy World features a huge exhibition of [[Santa Claus]], his home, his workshop and all of his little helpers.\n\n===Herlufsholm Kostskole===\n{{see also|Herlufsholm School}}\n[[File:Herlufsholm.jpg|thumb|left|Herlufsholm boarding School]]\nHerlufsholm [[Boarding school|Boarding School]] is located in the old Herlufsholm Kloster, on the bank of the Sus\u00e5 just outside the town of N\u00e6stved. For centuries students have attended the school, which enjoys a very respectable reputation. Today, the boarding school attracts students from all levels in the society, but earlier the school was more or less a high-society-only school.\n\nThe school houses various collections of scientific materials.\n\n===Holmegaard Glass Factory===\n{{see also|Holmegaard Glass Factory}}\n\nHolmegaard Glass Factory is a glass company located in the village of Holmegaard, just outside N\u00e6stved.\n\n===Gavn\u00f8 Castle===<!-- This section is linked from [[Gavn\u00f8 Castle]] -->\n[[File:Gavno Slot (2461557643).jpg|thumb|Gavn\u00f8 Castle]]\n\nGavn\u00f8 Castle is located on the island of Gavn\u00f8 near N\u00e6stved. The castle is known for its [[tulip]]s and a large collection of paintings.\n\nToday, the castle is owned by baron Otto Reedtz-Thott, and has been in the Reedtz-Thott family since 1737.\nThe castle covers some {{convert|2300|acre|km2}} of land, with {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of agriculture and {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of wood.\n\nThe castle has a vast variety of exhibitions during the year. The Gavn\u00f8 Classic Autojumble is Denmark's largest exhibition of [[classic car]]s, and takes place every summer. Also there is a [[Christmas market|Christmas Market]] taking place in the gardens during two weekends in November, which is one of the largest in the country.\n\nArt-, book-, hunting- and health-fairs also take place.\n\n===K\u00e4hler Ceramics===\nThe history of \"[[K\u00e4hler Keramik|K\u00e4hler]]\" has its beginning in 1839, when [[Herman K\u00e4hler]] took over an old pottery in N\u00e6stved, and founded the K\u00e4hler ceramic workshop.\n\nThe old pottery is still located downtown N\u00e6stved on \"K\u00e4hlersbakken\", a ten-minute walk from the Axeltorv Square in the city centre.\n\n==Transport==\nEasy access to the city is one of the top priorities for the local politicians of N\u00e6stved. Rail and roads are administrated by the State, so there is a lot of [[Lobbying]] going on behind the scenes. Locals are trying to get a motorway-connection for the city these days, but so far without success. On the other hand, the railways to and from N\u00e6stved have been improved greatly over the years, making N\u00e6stved easily accessible by train from most parts of Zealand.\n\n===Railways===\nN\u00e6stved has two stations both operated by [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[N\u00e6stved Station]] and [[N\u00e6stved Nord Station]]. N\u00e6stved Station serves trains on the [[Sydbanen]] line, and is the southern terminus for trains on the [[Lille Syd]] line. German [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] trains on the Copenhagen-Hamburg route stop at N\u00e6stved station. N\u00e6stved Nord only serves the Lille Syd line.\n\nHeavy traffic on the motorways to Copenhagen has increased the number of commuters using rail-transport to and from the Copenhagen area.\n\n===Buses===\nA broad network of buses connects N\u00e6stved City to its urban area, as well as all major surrounding cities. Ticketprices are reasonable, and tickets are bought from the driver when boarding the bus.\nAll buses depart from the bus-terminal at ''N\u00e6stved Station'' in the center of the town.\n\n===Roads===\nThe infrastructure in N\u00e6stved has been under pressure for some years now. The roads in the city center are heavily crowded at mornings and in the afternoon. The absence of a direct motorway-connection to Copenhagen has led to numerous discussions over the years, but still, N\u00e6stveders have to take the 15-minute roadtrip to nearby R\u00f8nnede (East of the city) to access the E47/E55, connecting the area to the rest of Europe.\n\nThere are direct road connections to nearby Ringsted, R\u00f8nnede, Slagelse, Pr\u00e6st\u00f8 and Vordingborg (80&nbsp;km/h) - all four cities within 30 minutes reach.\n\n=== Motorway N\u00e6stved - R\u00f8nnede ===\nThe Danish Road Directorate have made a study of a possible motorway between N\u00e6stved and R\u00f8nnede. The study shows that a motorway will cost a one billion DKK.\n\nOn 17 January 2013 the Danish Road Directorate had invited citizens, local politicians and others who were \ninterested, to a public meeting in Toksv\u00e6rd near Holme Olstrup. During this meeting, it \nwas decided that the possible motorway ([[N\u00e6stvedmotorvejen]]) should be connected \nnear the outskirts of R\u00f8nnede, by the upcoming \nbusiness area of [[Eco Valley]], near the South Motorway ([[Sydmotorvejen]]).\n\nAt the same time, both municipalities, and politicians will work for the completion of the motorway in approximately 10 years (by 2023).\n\nIn 2014 the funds for the first leg of the construction fase of the Motorway was allocated by the Danish government. The motorway between R\u00f8nnede and Boserup expected to be completed in 2021.\n\n[[File:Naestved Harbour.jpg|thumb|N\u00e6stved Harbour]]\n\n== Telecommunication ==\nAt N\u00e6stved, there is a 220.1 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting.\n\n==N\u00e6stved Harbour==\nN\u00e6stved Harbour is in the middle of the city and in a central location in Denmark, near to Storeb\u00e6ltsbroen (The [[Great Belt]] Bridge), and the Fehmarn connection can be reached within an hour by road.\n\nOne of the biggest stone plants in the country for the refinement of seabed materials is situated at N\u00e6stved Harbour. One of the reasons why the company chose to set up at N\u00e6stved Harbour was because it would be possible for their annual production of around 120 000 tonnes of material to be sent more quickly to customers - and because N\u00e6stved Harbour has exactly the kind of storage capacity required, regardless of whether goods are to be stored for a long time or just briefly.\n\n==Sports==\nThe town of N\u00e6stved has several teams in the top divisions of various sports. Most notably in the football leagues, where the team has traditionally played a role on the domestic scene, but recently the basket team has been the town's most successful [[Sport|sports team]].\n\nThe town has [[N\u00e6stved Arena]] and [[N\u00e6stved Stadion]] as larg sport facilities. It also have a public swimming pool with a characteristic curved roof.\n\n===N\u00e6stved Boldklub (football)===\n[[N\u00e6stved BK]] is a [[football team]] operating as a club, founded in 1939 as a merger between N\u00e6stved Idr\u00e6tsklub and N\u00e6stved Boldklub. They placed first in the [[Danish Division]], the second best league of Denmark.

The city has the largest high school in Denmark, [[Education in Denmark|N\u00e6stved Gymnasium & HF]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Naestved1600.20090723(020).jpg|thumb|Diorama inside the N\u00e6stved Museum showing N\u00e6stved as it appeared circa 1600.]]\n\nN\u00e6stved has roots as far back as 400-500 BC. Archaeological material from this period has been found in the soil under N\u00e6stved, and tells of human life here long before the [[Viking Age|Viking era]].\n\nThe name of the city, N\u00e6stved, derives from two words: N\u00e6s and Tved. Tved means \"cleared land\" or \"cleared wood\" (as \"thwaite\" in English toponyms), and refers to the city's origin in the woods of southern Zealand, on the banks of the [[Sus\u00e5 River|Sus\u00e5]]. \"N\u00e6s\" is the Danish word for a small peninsula (as \"ness\" in English toponyms), and probably refers to the city's placing on the peninsulas Ydern\u00e6s, Grimstrup N\u00e6s, and Appen\u00e6s.\n\nIn 1135, [[Benedictine]] monks received Saint Peter's Church and surrounding land in order to found [[St. Peter's Priory]]. This is seen as the foundation of the town of N\u00e6stved, although the town appears to have existed already at that time, being both big and important to the region.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Valdemar Atterdag.jpg|thumb|[[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar IV of Denmark (Valdemar Atterdag)]] shown on a [[fresco]] in Saint Peter's Church in N\u00e6stved ''(Sankt Peders Kirke)''.]]\nN\u00e6stved has various museums, concert-venues, theaters and exhibitions of all kinds during the year.\n\n===Churches===\n[[File:Skt. Mortens Kirke - N\u00e6stved.jpg|thumb|St Martin's Church]]\nN\u00e6stved has five [[Danish National Church]]es: [[St. Martin's Church (N\u00e6stved)|St. Martin's Church]]<!--Sankt Mortens Kirke-->, [[St. Peter's Church, N\u00e6stved|St. Peter's Church]]<!--Sankt Peder Kirke, which is known for its [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[chancel]] and its [[baroque]] furnishings-->, [[Saint John's Church (N\u00e6stved)|Saint John's Church]]<!--Sankt J\u00f8rgens Kirke-->, [[Herlufsholm Church]], and [[Holsted Church]].  There are other churches in the town, such as Sj\u00f8lundkirken.  <!-- If it more religious than other places in Denmark, maybe that should be clarified.  Otherwise, maybe a little information about what else characterizes N\u00e6stved today, would be in order [[Herlufsholm School|Herlufsholm kostskole]]-->\n\n===Music and stage arts===\nGr\u00f8nnegades Kaserne Kulturcenter was opened in 2002 in what used to be [[Barracks|military barracks]]. It is in the center of the city, only five minutes walk away from the station. Denmark's top artists perform here, along with various names from abroad. Amongst the best-known foreign artists to have visited N\u00e6stved over the last few years are [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Beth Hart]], Runrig and [[Modern Talking]].\n\nIn recent years, various theatres have emerged in N\u00e6stved, culminating with the creation of an \"Egns Teater\" - a local theatre - in 2006. Performances by talented local artists add to N\u00e6stved's position as a cultural stronghold on Zealand outside Copenhagen.\n\n\"Studenternes Hus\" downtown (House of Students) is also a widely known and frequently used venue for local and national acts, as well as mid-range artistes from abroad. Cheap entry fees and a relaxed atmosphere attract a young crowd.\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Helligaandshuset Naestved.jpg|thumb|Hellig\u00e5ndshuset housing N\u00e6stved Museum]]\nN\u00e6stved has a range of museums of local importance. In the city centre, N\u00e6stved Museum offers the full story of N\u00e6stved - from the very first settlements till this day. In Stenboderne, near [[St. Peter's Church (N\u00e6stved)|St. Peter's Church]], a collection of ancient findings are on show, including pottery, armory and more.\n\n[[N\u00e6stved Museum]] has exhibits covering the development of [[K\u00e4hler Keramik|K\u00e4hler Ceramics]] and [[Holmegaard Glass Factory|Holmegaard Glass]]. It is open to visitors every day except Monday. There are also interesting exhibits on textiles, toys and silverware. The museum consists of two separate buildings: Hellig\u00e5ndshuset on Ringstedgade to the north of the central square and Boderne on Sct. Peters Kirkeplads to the southwest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aabne-samlinger.dk/naestved/english/|title=N\u00e6stved Museum|publisher=N\u00e6stved Museum|accessdate=20 November 2012 |language=}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nOn 1 January 2007, the size and population of the municipality of N\u00e6stved increased, as the government decided to merge four smaller municipalities with the municipality of N\u00e6stved. N\u00e6stved emerged with nearby Fuglebjerg, Flads\u00e5, Holmegaard and Sus\u00e5, increasing population in the municipality of N\u00e6stved to more than 80.000. That made N\u00e6stved the second-largest town on Zealand, only outranked by the capital, Copenhagen.\n\nExperienced mayor, Henning Jensen, led the city through the merger, and stayed head of the city council, with the four mayors from the other merged municipalities taking place as members of the council. Henning Jensen remained mayor of N\u00e6stved until 2011.\n\n===Political history===\nTraditionally, the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]] has had the majority of seats in the City Council of N\u00e6stved. Today, they also have the most seats (\u2153 of the seats with support from other leftist parties).\n\nThe mayors of the town have been. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10em;\" | Name\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10em;\" | Political party\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:19em;\" | Period\n|-\n| [[Henning Jensen (born 1946)|Henning Jensen]]\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]\n| 2007 (1988)- May 2011\n|-\n| [[Carsten Rasmussen]]\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]\n| May 2011 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" rowspan=\"2\"|'''Political party'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" colspan=\"5\" |'''Seats'''\n|-\n|[[2001 Danish local elections|2001]]<ref>[http://www.kmdvalg.dk/kv/2001/kp421373.htm N\u00e6stved Kommune.

Later on Finland also became part of the network, with Iceland and the independent regions of \u00c5land, Greenland and [[Faroe Islands]] to follow.\n\nN\u00e6stved entered the project in 1947.\n\nN\u00e6stved's Cities of Friendship as per 1.1.2007:\n* [[Gj\u00f8vik]] - [[Norway]]\n* [[G\u00e4vle]] - [[Sweden]]\n* [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] - [[Finland]]\n* [[Bessastadahreppur]] - [[Iceland]]\n\n==Shopping==\n\n===N\u00e6stved Stor Center===\nIn 1989, a large [[shopping mall]] was established on what was then the outskirts of the city. The mall is called N\u00e6stved Storcenter (''N\u00e6stved Big Center''), and houses over 80 shops. Clothing, [[Danish design]] and much more can be found here. The center also offers seven restaurants of various kinds, from [[Mexican cuisine]] to pizzas, and hamburgers. People from most of Zealand come here to shop, and the large warehouse, BILKA, attracts a lot of customers.\n\nN\u00e6stved Storcenter is on the outer edge of the city, and is easily accessible by bus (from N\u00e6stved Station) and by train (N\u00e6stved Nord Station is a five-minute walk from the mall entrance).\n\n===N\u00e6stved Mega Center===\nJust next to N\u00e6stved Storcenter you will find N\u00e6stved Mega Center, which, though, in comparison is rather small. N\u00e6stved Megacenter is home for approx. 10 large stores offering everything from electronics to baby-wear.\n\n===N\u00e6stved City Centre===\nThe heart of the city has a large [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian area]] for a place of its size.\n\nEvery Wednesday and Saturday there's a market in the city centre on \"Axeltorv\" (Axle Square) - a very old square, dating back to the founding of the city.<ref>http://www.visitnaestved.com/ln-int/south-sealand/shopping-naestved</ref>\n\nN\u00e6stved has always been a hub of trade and commerce. Even before the year 1274 N\u00e6stved enjoyed the status of being a royal market town, and the market square itself predates 1140. The two names \u2013 Axeltorv (\u201cAxle Square\u201d) and Hjultorv (\u201cWheel Square\u201d) \u2013 tell us that the market wares arrived and were sold on wheels. \nToday, N\u00e6stved is known for its shopping centres and an attractive town environment full of specialist shops. Market days are still held on Axeltorv Wednesday and Saturday every week, and every year the town centre holds its own \u201cCity Night\u201d (mostly held on Fridays). This event often features music and other kinda of Entertainment, the shops stay open late until 10pm.\n\n==Industries==\n''(This section needs development)''\n\nNear the sea, with the harbour in the city centre, N\u00e6stved was traditionally a city of industry. In recent years, though, industry in the city centre has decreased, as production has moved to the outskirts of the city - primarily on ''Ydern\u00e6s''.\n\nAmong the companies in N\u00e6stved are [[Emerson Electric]] and Ropox A/S.\n\n===Novenco===\nN\u00e6stved's largest industry. Novenco develop and manufacture heating, ventilation, [[Air conditioning|air-conditioning]] and refrigeration [[solution]]s for land and marine applications, along with numerous other products including [[Firefighter|fire-fighting]] products and systems.\n\nIn 1999 Novenco was sold to [[Johnson Controls|York International]] Inc., and had its name changed to York Novenco. In 2006, however, York Novenco was acquired by Dania Capital (a Danish [[investment company]]), who changed its name back to Novenco once again.\n\n===Ardagh Glass===\nThe major glass bottle company Based in Fensmark Is the largest private employer in the municipality with about 400 employees manufacturing bottles for soft drinks and beers among its most common products. It is part of the Irish Ardagh Group and until recently the fears was that the factory would be closed due to economic issues that today have been resolved and the factory is doing well again.\n\n==Media==\n''(This section needs improvement)''\n\nN\u00e6stved has numerous local media, from newspapers to daily [[Broadcasting|television broadcasts]]. Media company \"Sj\u00e6llandske Medier\" (Zealandic Media) has its headquarters in downtown N\u00e6stved, and runs a local as well as a regional newspaper called ''Ugeavisen N\u00e6stved'' and ''Sj\u00e6llandkse''. Sj\u00e6llandske Medier also operates a local TV-station called \"24Sj\u00e6llandske\", offering [[local news]] [[24/7|twenty-four-seven]].\n\nThe national Danish broadcasting company [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] has its department covering [[Region Zealand]].\n\n==Urban life==\nOver the last 10 years, N\u00e6stved has developed into a more lively city than before. The trend of going out to caf\u00e9s struck N\u00e6stved in the beginning of this century, and today, the town offers several caf\u00e9s in the City Centre.\n\nAlso, the population has increased heavily, and actually N\u00e6stved is the second fastest growing city in Denmark, only out-performed by Denmark's second largest city [[Aarhus]]. More people means more ideas, and that shows in N\u00e6stved, where new galleries, workshops and the like have been established in recent years.\n\nThe traffic in down-town N\u00e6stved can be very congested at times. New roads around the city has solved part of this problem, but the traffic can still be heavy, specially around 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nThe city received a new library in 2005, just beside another new institution: Gr\u00f8nnegade Cultural Center in the center of N\u00e6stved.\n\n==Attractions==\nN\u00e6stved and the surrounding area offer a wide variety of attractions for all ages. The town is especially rich in [[Medieval architecture]]; [[Old Town Hall (N\u00e6stved)|Old Town Hall]] is from about 1450, [[Hellig\u00e5ndshuset i N\u00e6stved]] dates around 1500, [[Boderne (N\u00e6stved)|Boderne]] is terraced buildings which have contained shops, and the oldest are from about 1400, [[Kompagnihuset]] is from 1493 and the two timber framed buildings Apostelhuset and Ridderhuset is both the beginning for the 1600th century.\n\nThe local museum, [[N\u00e6stved Museum]], is housed in Hellig\u00e5ndshuset and offers en exhibition of [[archeological]] findings from N\u00e6stved and the nearby area from the stone ages until moderne times.\n\n===Sus\u00e5===\nThe [[Sus\u00e5 River]] is Denmark's third longest river and flows through N\u00e6stved. After the demolition of a huge [[parking lot]] above it, the Sus\u00e5 has recently become more visible in the city. The Sus\u00e5 is surrounded on both sides by the Herlufsholm Forrest from the city center to Herlufsholm. Visitors are able to walk down both sides of the Sus\u00e5, and enjoy both the forest, the river, and [[Herlufsholm School|Herlufsholm Boarding school]].\n\nFishing and canoeing are allowed on the river.\n\n===BonBon Land===\nN\u00e6stved is home to the [[amusement park]] [[BonBon-Land]] located at Holme Olstrup, just 10 minutes from the city center. The park has increased dramatically in size over recent years, and was in 2012 among the 20 most visited sights in all of Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/sites/default/files/vdk_images/PDF-and-other-files/Analyser/2013/visitdenmark_attraktionslisten_2012.pdf|title=List of the 50 most visited Danish attractions (2012), visitdenmark.dk|author=|date=|website=visitdenmark.dk}}</ref>\n\nRecently, a new feature has been added to the amusement park in Holme Olstrup. It is called [[Fantasy world|Fantasy World]], and used to be located in Ringsted. It has now been bought by BonBon Land, and is located immediately next to it. Fantasy World features a huge exhibition of [[Santa Claus]], his home, his workshop and all of his little helpers.\n\n===Herlufsholm Kostskole===\n{{see also|Herlufsholm School}}\n[[File:Herlufsholm.jpg|thumb|left|Herlufsholm boarding School]]\nHerlufsholm [[Boarding school|Boarding School]] is located in the old Herlufsholm Kloster, on the bank of the Sus\u00e5 just outside the town of N\u00e6stved. For centuries students have attended the school, which enjoys a very respectable reputation. Today, the boarding school attracts students from all levels in the society, but earlier the school was more or less a high-society-only school.\n\nThe school houses various collections of scientific materials.\n\n===Holmegaard Glass Factory===\n{{see also|Holmegaard Glass Factory}}\n\nHolmegaard Glass Factory is a glass company located in the village of Holmegaard, just outside N\u00e6stved.\n\n===Gavn\u00f8 Castle===<!-- This section is linked from [[Gavn\u00f8 Castle]] -->\n[[File:Gavno Slot (2461557643).jpg|thumb|Gavn\u00f8 Castle]]\n\nGavn\u00f8 Castle is located on the island of Gavn\u00f8 near N\u00e6stved.

Also there is a [[Christmas market|Christmas Market]] taking place in the gardens during two weekends in November, which is one of the largest in the country.\n\nArt-, book-, hunting- and health-fairs also take place.\n\n===K\u00e4hler Ceramics===\nThe history of \"[[K\u00e4hler Keramik|K\u00e4hler]]\" has its beginning in 1839, when [[Herman K\u00e4hler]] took over an old pottery in N\u00e6stved, and founded the K\u00e4hler ceramic workshop.\n\nThe old pottery is still located downtown N\u00e6stved on \"K\u00e4hlersbakken\", a ten-minute walk from the Axeltorv Square in the city centre.\n\n==Transport==\nEasy access to the city is one of the top priorities for the local politicians of N\u00e6stved. Rail and roads are administrated by the State, so there is a lot of [[Lobbying]] going on behind the scenes. Locals are trying to get a motorway-connection for the city these days, but so far without success. On the other hand, the railways to and from N\u00e6stved have been improved greatly over the years, making N\u00e6stved easily accessible by train from most parts of Zealand.\n\n===Railways===\nN\u00e6stved has two stations both operated by [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[N\u00e6stved Station]] and [[N\u00e6stved Nord Station]]. N\u00e6stved Station serves trains on the [[Sydbanen]] line, and is the southern terminus for trains on the [[Lille Syd]] line. German [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] trains on the Copenhagen-Hamburg route stop at N\u00e6stved station. N\u00e6stved Nord only serves the Lille Syd line.\n\nHeavy traffic on the motorways to Copenhagen has increased the number of commuters using rail-transport to and from the Copenhagen area.\n\n===Buses===\nA broad network of buses connects N\u00e6stved City to its urban area, as well as all major surrounding cities. Ticketprices are reasonable, and tickets are bought from the driver when boarding the bus.\nAll buses depart from the bus-terminal at ''N\u00e6stved Station'' in the center of the town.\n\n===Roads===\nThe infrastructure in N\u00e6stved has been under pressure for some years now. The roads in the city center are heavily crowded at mornings and in the afternoon. The absence of a direct motorway-connection to Copenhagen has led to numerous discussions over the years, but still, N\u00e6stveders have to take the 15-minute roadtrip to nearby R\u00f8nnede (East of the city) to access the E47/E55, connecting the area to the rest of Europe.\n\nThere are direct road connections to nearby Ringsted, R\u00f8nnede, Slagelse, Pr\u00e6st\u00f8 and Vordingborg (80&nbsp;km/h) - all four cities within 30 minutes reach.\n\n=== Motorway N\u00e6stved - R\u00f8nnede ===\nThe Danish Road Directorate have made a study of a possible motorway between N\u00e6stved and R\u00f8nnede. The study shows that a motorway will cost a one billion DKK.\n\nOn 17 January 2013 the Danish Road Directorate had invited citizens, local politicians and others who were \ninterested, to a public meeting in Toksv\u00e6rd near Holme Olstrup. During this meeting, it \nwas decided that the possible motorway ([[N\u00e6stvedmotorvejen]]) should be connected \nnear the outskirts of R\u00f8nnede, by the upcoming \nbusiness area of [[Eco Valley]], near the South Motorway ([[Sydmotorvejen]]).\n\nAt the same time, both municipalities, and politicians will work for the completion of the motorway in approximately 10 years (by 2023).\n\nIn 2014 the funds for the first leg of the construction fase of the Motorway was allocated by the Danish government. The motorway between R\u00f8nnede and Boserup expected to be completed in 2021.\n\n[[File:Naestved Harbour.jpg|thumb|N\u00e6stved Harbour]]\n\n== Telecommunication ==\nAt N\u00e6stved, there is a 220.1 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting.\n\n==N\u00e6stved Harbour==\nN\u00e6stved Harbour is in the middle of the city and in a central location in Denmark, near to Storeb\u00e6ltsbroen (The [[Great Belt]] Bridge), and the Fehmarn connection can be reached within an hour by road.\n\nOne of the biggest stone plants in the country for the refinement of seabed materials is situated at N\u00e6stved Harbour. One of the reasons why the company chose to set up at N\u00e6stved Harbour was because it would be possible for their annual production of around 120 000 tonnes of material to be sent more quickly to customers - and because N\u00e6stved Harbour has exactly the kind of storage capacity required, regardless of whether goods are to be stored for a long time or just briefly.\n\n==Sports==\nThe town of N\u00e6stved has several teams in the top divisions of various sports. Most notably in the football leagues, where the team has traditionally played a role on the domestic scene, but recently the basket team has been the town's most successful [[Sport|sports team]].\n\nThe town has [[N\u00e6stved Arena]] and [[N\u00e6stved Stadion]] as larg sport facilities. It also have a public swimming pool with a characteristic curved roof.\n\n===N\u00e6stved Boldklub (football)===\n[[N\u00e6stved BK]] is a [[football team]] operating as a club, founded in 1939 as a merger between N\u00e6stved Idr\u00e6tsklub and N\u00e6stved Boldklub. They placed first in the [[Danish Division]], the second best league of Denmark. The home kit is green-green-white (jersey-shorts-socks) and the away kit is red-red-white.\n\nResults achieved by the club;\n* Bronze medal winners: 1972, 1975, 1981, 1986\n* Silver medal winners: 1980, 1988\n* [[Danish Cup]] runners-up: 1994\n* Danish champions ([[indoor soccer]]): 2003\n\n===Team FOG N\u00e6stved (basketball)===\n''Further information: [[Team FOG N\u00e6stved]]''\n\nN\u00e6stved's basket team plays in the best league of Denmark ([[Canal Digital]] Ligaen).\nThe 1980s was a successful decade for the team, where it managed to play in the best league for some years, and after a less successful 1990s decade the team is now back in the top division and currently has the ambition to be one of the dominating teams of Denmark within few years.\n\nThey have reached the Danish Cup Final twice - in 2007 and again in 2009. Both times they played [[Bakken Bears]] from [[Aarhus]] - they lost both times though.\n\n===Other sport teams in N\u00e6stved===\n*[[N\u00e6stved Vikings]] - [[American football]]\n*[[Team Python Pro]] - Cycling (Team Python Pro is the professional part of N\u00e6stved Bicycle Club (NBC))\n*[[N\u00e6stved-Herlufsholm H\u00e5ndbold]] - Handball (both men and women)\n*[[VK N\u00e6stved]] - Volleyball\n*[[Kvik N\u00e6stved]] - [[Table tennis]] - Competes in the best Danish table tennis league\n*[[HG Fodbold]] (part of Herlufsholm Gymnastikforening) - Football\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Hans Borchsenius]], newspaperman and politician\n* [[Harald T.

In practice, the raw Ztot signal (in O) is transformed to the \u2013dZ/dt waveform (filtered negative [[first derivative]], in O x s-1) by using the first derivative to remark the [[inflection points]] of the raw Ztot signal. The most important characteristics points of the \u2013dZ/dt waveform are B, C and X points (see figure 2). All these points are associated to distinct physiological events within the systolic part of the [[cardiac cycle]], i.e., located after the [[QRS complex]] onset. In that sense, the R wave from the [[ECG]] signal can be an important reference for detecting such events.\n\n=== Detecting characteristic points of the ICG signal: problems and solutions. ===\nThe ICG signal is extremely sensitive to artefacts due to movements and respiration. Baseline variations can considerably alter the dZ/dtmax point and the dependent hemodynamic parameters. High frequency interferences also can affect the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] in estimating some characteristics points, essentially the B point, affecting the LVET dependent parameters. The qCO's algorithm uses classical and advanced adaptive filtering techniques to minimize such problems with good results. The algorithm applies a [[Band pass filter|band pass filtering stage]], which attenuates both the baseline drifts (due to movement or respiration) and the high-frequency signal. Also, it features [[Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system|Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)]], for higher accuracy, which is able to obliterate even artefacts such as the electrosurgical noise.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Woltjer |first=H.H. |last2=Bogaard |first2=H.J. |last3=de Vries |first3=J.M. |title= The technique of impedance cardiography |volume= 18 |issue=9 |date=1997 |journal=Eur.

Lately, new kinds of methods and devices have been developed. Nowadays, at practice, the method election is determined mainly by the features of the patients and the possibilities of the hospital to accede to this technology.\nDifferent CO monitor methods can be characterized by their invasiveness or their ability to measure continuously. The most ideal should be reliable, continuous, non-invasive, easy to use and cost-effective.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=de Waal |first=E. E.

One of them is the [[Cardiac output#Pulmonary artery thermodilution|Thermodilution Transpulmonary (TDTP)]], developed in the late 90's, which presents risk of [[iatrogenic effect]] effects such as [[pneumothorax]], [[Bleeding]], [[infection]], [[thrombosis]] or [[ischemia|vascular ischemia]], inherent to the requirement of both [[Central venous catheter|arterial and central venous catheter]]. As calibrating method, this system performs a thermodilution curve by measuring the changes in blood temperature due to the injection of cold serum and calculates the CO intermittently through a modified equation of Stewart-Hamilton.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Garc\u00eda |first=X. |last2=Mateu |first2=L.  |last3=Maynar |first3=J. |last4=Mercadal |first4=J. |last5=Ochagav\u00eda |first5=A.|last6=Ferrandiz |first6=A. |title=Estimating cardiac output.

Furthermore, the values may be modified in patients with [[Intra-aortic balloon pumps|Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP)]] or unstable arterial signal as in cases of severe arrhythmias or [[Ventricular extrasystole|ventricular extrasystolia]]. The signal can be altered also by shock or hypothermia states because of the peripheral vasoconstriction or arterial spasm. Usually for calculating the stroke volume, the methods based on pulse wave analysis need previous and periodic calibrations that must be done in the same patient, which is a drawback.\nThe main non-invasive methods can be classified in two groups. The first group is formed by different variations of the echocardiography and [[Echo Doppler studies|echo-Doppler techniques]] and the second group is comprised by the aortic bioimpedance and bioreactance.\n\n== Benefits of using the qCO ==\nDoppler or echocardiography systems cannot assess the CO continuously. The continuous assessment capability is the major advantage of the qCO device. This is especially important to predict if the patient is fluid responsive in cases of hemodynamic instability or circulatory shock, which can be assessed with a simple test named [[Passive leg raising test|Passive Leg Raising]] (PLR, described in detail below), for which, the quick variations in the CO should be detected.\nAnother benefit is the fact that qCO is fully non-invasive, thus avoiding risks for the patient. Further, it does not need to be calibrated, that allows accelerating and simplifying the monitoring, thereby, providing a large benefit for both the patients and clinicians.\nThe Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) method is influenced by mechanical ventilation, due to changes in the pleural pressure, hence, such monitoring should not be recommended for patients who are not being mechanically ventilated with a regular tidal volume.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Lopes |first=M.

The SV in turn, depends on three general factors: [[Preload (cardiology)|pre-load]], [[Afterload|post-load]] and [[myocardial contractility]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Possible causes for <u>increasing</u> CO:\t!! Possible causes for <u>decreasing</u> CO:\n|-\n| Increased demand of O2.

(I.e. pain, fear or anxiety states).\t|| High Systemic Vascular Resistance. (E.g. caused by hypertension, vasoconstriction, and mitral insufficiency).\n|-\n| Other states such as pregnancy, liver disease and hyperthyroidism.\t||\n|}\n\nIn the field of anaesthesia the main reason for CO monitoring during surgery are complications that can arise after the immediate postoperative period (such as hypoxemia, tachycardia or oliguria) and also, if the therapeutic intervention becomes complex. Despite of some clinicians believe that the CO monitor can be introduced only when complications emerge, it is recommended to monitor since before the induction in order to have a baseline.\nFluid administration in the intraoperative period is part of the daily practice in anaesthesiology. Several studies have demonstrated that the time of administering fluid therapy can be more important than the volume dispensed; thus the treatment guided by BP is primitive, whereas the functional parameters CO and SV can detect easily and quickly the preload variations\nIn the branch of medicine intensive care, the CO and other related parameters may be useful for the differential diagnosis of shock states such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic or septic.\n\n===The Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)===\nThe rise of volume is the main therapy elected to improve oxygen delivery. However, approximately, only 50% of subjects respond to fluids by increasing SV. The treatment of non-responsive patients can promote deleterious effects in the pulmonary system due to the increase in extravascular fluid. Hence it is important to have a tool to determine this condition.\nIt is called SVV to the physiological variations, due to changes in intra-thoracic pressure of spontaneous breathing, which diminish the arterial pulse pressure during inspiration and increase it during inspiration; however if the SVV decreases too much, it can be termed paradoxical pulse, and can be related to different pathologies such EPOC or pericarditis.\nIn mechanically ventilated patients, the same process takes place in reverse, due to the positive pressure. Therefore, the normal values of SVV depend on the ventilation mode, and it can be calculated through the SV with the formula: <math> SVV= (SV_{max} - SV_{min}) / SV_{mean} </math>, by a respiratory cycle or other period of time.\nDuring mechanical ventilation the goal is to maintain SVV between 10-15%, higher values along with a low SV may indicate the need of volume resuscitation.\n\n[[File:Stroke volume decresing.png|450px|center]]\n\nSVV may be fairly sensitive and specific used as a dynamic indicator of the volume status to answer the question: \u201cIs your patient fluid responsive?\u201d, compared to the conventional parameters. However, using the SVV should not be recommended to interpret the situation of patients with arrhythmias or vasodilator therapy. Also, to avoid natural variations, the patients must be under mechanical ventilation.\n\n==Therapy and methods==\n\n===The Goal Directed Therapy (GDT)===\nA critical point for the fluid management in some medical specialties is to adjust the intravascular volume replacement. An incorrect practice can seriously affect the organ function and hence the outcome. Guiding fluid management using standard physiologic variables such as BP and HR, because of their regulated nature, is usually insensitive to changes in intravascular volume and may be misleading for example occulting a hypo-perfusion state. Therefore, optimizing the cardiac preload with fluid administration guided by BP is not reliable.\n\nWith the formula to achieve objectives, called Goal Directed Therapy (GDT), Rivers (2001) demonstrated how to reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock through the optimization of different haemodynamic variables for a dynamic and individualized view, instead of maintaining only an adequate Arterial Pressure (AP). Later publications support that the intraoperative GDT, used to maintain an adequate systemic oxygenation, can safeguard organs especially sensible from perioperative hypo-perfusion. High risk patients or even less pernicious patients to major surgery could profit from GDT by reducing incidence of postoperative complications, thus, improving and accelerating the outcome.\n\nThe CO measurement in cardiology provides rewarding diagnostic and prognostic information for the management of patients with left- and right-sided cardiac dysfunction. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) may diminish the CO and promote right-sided heart failure, which untreated could be fatal. A simultaneous measurement of the preload also enables to assay the blood flow levels to discard states of hypovolemia or hypervolemia.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Rivers |first=E. |title= Early goal-directed therapy in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock |volume= 345 |issue=19 |date=2001 |journal= N.

Another option is the passive leg raising test, which consists of inducing a fast and transient hemodynamic challenge without fluid infusion. By modifying the patient's position, a volume of venous blood from the lower body toward the right heart it is transferred, simulating an infusion of approximately 300ml.\n\n[[File:Passive Leg Raising test.png|thumb|center| Figure 3: For maximal reliability, the PLR test must be performed following some rules. One possible variation of PLR starts from the semi-recumbent position 1. The second step comprises to go down the trunk and raise legs maintaining the angle between them using the automatic motion of the bed for avoiding artefacts. Finally the third step goes back to position 1 to ensure that the subject recovers the previous hemodynamic parameters.| 500px]]\n\nAn increase in the CO (of = 10%) and AP within the next 60\u201390 seconds after leg elevation indicates a positive result, suggesting that the patient is fluid responsive and might benefit from additional fluid. By contrast if the test is negative, the patient should not be treated as it would be harmful. The fluid overload can raise extravascular water causing deleterious side effects in lungs.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Monnet |first=X. |last2=Teboul |first2=J. |title= Passive leg raising?: five rules, not a drop of fluid! |date=2015 | pages= 1\u20133}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:CO Incresing.png|400px|center]]\n\n===The Frank Starling\u2019s curve===\nThe basic mechanisms for the haemodynamic regulation are:\n* Intrinsically cardiac regulation in function of the venous return.\n* Control of HR by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).\n\nThe explanation why the heart is capable of adapting to growing volumes of blood flow is called 'Frank-Starling's mechanism', which says that the more distended are the muscle during the filling, the more strength of contraction and quantity of blood pumped by the left-ventricle to the aorta. When the heart reaches a physiological limitation, then blood pumping cannot increase, although the venous return is further increased. The SVV contributes to know the state of volemia in ventilated patients and designates the point on the Frank-Starling curve where the patient is.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mateu Campos |first=M.L. |last2=Ferr\u00e1ndiz Sell\u00e9s |first2=A. |last3= Gruartmoner de Vera |first3=G. |last4=Mesquida Febrer |first4=J. |last5=Sabatier Cloarec |first5=C. |last6=Poveda Hern\u00e1ndez |first6=Y. |last7=Garc\u00eda Nogales |first7=X. |title= Techniques available for hemodynamic monitoring.

Nowadays, it has become a widely used tool for study the ANS modulation in clinical areas such as cardiology. Even though, its utility is not well known yet. The interest lies in its profound relation with the breathing, ANS and cardiac autonomic regulation.\n\nThe most relevant and validated capacity is to prognosticate the coronary heart disease patients, accordingly, a reduced HRV is related to high risk of mortality after a myocardial infarction.\nAnother important point is the fact that the Inflammation is stimulated by effect of the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibited by the sympathetic, thereby, could also be measured through the R-R intervals to guide the physician.\n\nSeveral reports maintain that the HRV analysis is a highly accurate indicator of the autonomic dysfunction in alcoholic and diabetic subjects. Also, it is growing the interest in apply the HRV to evaluate the neurologic function, and the best results have been found out in the psychiatric patients.\nRegarding the anaesthesia and critical care fields, the ANS dysfunction should be considered because it is related to high morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia effect. Naturally, events as the tracheal intubation and inhalation agents can produce quick variations in ANS. Also, should be regarded in critical patients who may show a worse outcome when it is added to certain illnesses such as sepsis [24,25].\n<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mazzeo AT |first=S.L. |last2=La Monaca |first2=E. |last3= Di Leo |first3=R. |last4=Vita |first4=G. |title= Heart rate variability: a diagnostic and prognostic tool in anesthesia and intensive care |volume= 55 | issue = 7  |date=2011 |journal=  Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. | pages= 797\u2013811 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02466.x|pmid=21658013 }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Huang |first=H.H. |last2=Chan |first2=H.L. |last3= Lin |first3=L. |last4=Wu |first4=C.P. |last5=Huang |first5=C.H. |title= Time-frequency spectral analysis of heart rate variability during induction of general anaesthesia |volume= 79 |issue=6 |date=1997 |journal=  Br.

In practice, the raw Ztot signal (in O) is transformed to the \u2013dZ/dt waveform (filtered negative [[first derivative]], in O x s-1) by using the first derivative to remark the [[inflection points]] of the raw Ztot signal. The most important characteristics points of the \u2013dZ/dt waveform are B, C and X points (see figure 2). All these points are associated to distinct physiological events within the systolic part of the [[cardiac cycle]], i.e., located after the [[QRS complex]] onset. In that sense, the R wave from the [[ECG]] signal can be an important reference for detecting such events.\n\n=== Detecting characteristic points of the ICG signal: problems and solutions. ===\nThe ICG signal is extremely sensitive to artefacts due to movements and respiration. Baseline variations can considerably alter the dZ/dtmax point and the dependent hemodynamic parameters. High frequency interferences also can affect the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] in estimating some characteristics points, essentially the B point, affecting the LVET dependent parameters. The qCO\u2019s algorithm uses classical and advanced adaptive filtering techniques to minimize such problems with good results. The algorithm applies a [[Band pass filter|band pass filtering stage]], which attenuates both the baseline drifts (due to movement or respiration) and the high-frequency signal. Also, it features [[Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system|Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)]], for higher accuracy, which is able to obliterate even artefacts such as the electrosurgical noise.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Woltjer |first=H.H. |last2=Bogaard |first2=H.J. |last3=de Vries |first3=J.M. |title= The technique of impedance cardiography |volume= 18 |issue=9 |date=1997 |journal=Eur.

One of them is the [[Cardiac output#Pulmonary artery thermodilution|Thermodilution Transpulmonary (TDTP)]], developed in the late 90\u2019s, which presents risk of [[iatrogenic effect]] effects such as [[pneumothorax]], [[Bleeding]], [[infection]], [[thrombosis]] or [[ischemia|vascular ischemia]], inherent to the requirement of both [[Central venous catheter|arterial and central venous catheter]]. As calibrating method, this system performs a thermodilution curve by measuring the changes in blood temperature due to the injection of cold serum and calculates the CO intermittently through a modified equation of Stewart-Hamilton.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Garc\u00eda |first=X. |last2=Mateu |first2=L.  |last3=Maynar |first3=J. |last4=Mercadal |first4=J. |last5=Ochagav\u00eda |first5=A.|last6=Ferrandiz |first6=A. |title=Estimating cardiac output.

Furthermore, the values may be modified in patients with [[Intra-aortic balloon pumps|Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps (IABP)]] or unstable arterial signal as in cases of severe arrhythmias or [[Ventricular extrasystole|ventricular extrasystolia]]. The signal can be altered also by shock or hypothermia states because of the peripheral vasoconstriction or arterial spasm. Usually for calculating the stroke volume, the methods based on pulse wave analysis need previous and periodic calibrations that must be done in the same patient, which is a drawback.\nThe main non-invasive methods can be classified in two groups. The first group is formed by different variations of the echocardiography and [[Echo Doppler studies|echo-Doppler techniques]] and the second group is comprised by the aortic bioimpedance and bioreactance.\n\n== Benefits of using the qCO ==\nDoppler or echocardiography systems cannot assess the CO continuously. The continuous assessment capability is the major advantage of the qCO device. This is especially important to predict if the patient is fluid responsive in cases of hemodynamic instability or circulatory shock, which can be assessed with a simple test named [[Passive leg raising test|Passive Leg Raising]] (PLR, described in detail below), for which, the quick variations in the CO should be detected.\nAnother benefit is the fact that qCO is fully non-invasive, thus avoiding risks for the patient. Further, it does not need to be calibrated, that allows accelerating and simplifying the monitoring, thereby, providing a large benefit for both the patients and clinicians.\nThe Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) method is influenced by mechanical ventilation, due to changes in the pleural pressure, hence, such monitoring should not be recommended for patients who are not being mechanically ventilated with a regular tidal volume.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Lopes |first=M.

The SV in turn, depends on three general factors: [[Preload (cardiology)|pre-load]], [[Afterload|post-load]] and [[myocardial contractility]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Possible causes for <u>increasing</u> CO:\t!! Possible causes for <u>decreasing</u> CO:\n|-\n| Increased demand of O2. (I.e. during exercise).\t|| Deficit of ventricular filling.(Can be caused by hypovolemia).\n|-\n| States of decreased [[Vascular resistance|Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)]]. (I.e. systemic inflammation).\t|| Low ventricular emptying.  <br />(Caused by e.g. contractility alteration, valvulopathy).\n|-\n| Increased [[sympathetic response]]. (I.e. pain, fear or anxiety states).\t|| High Systemic Vascular Resistance. (E.g. caused by hypertension, vasoconstriction, and mitral insufficiency).\n|-\n| Other states such as pregnancy, liver disease and hyperthyroidism.\t||\n|}\n\nIn the field of anaesthesia the main reason for CO monitoring during surgery are complications that can arise after the immediate postoperative period (such as hypoxemia, tachycardia or oliguria) and also, if the therapeutic intervention becomes complex. Despite of some clinicians believe that the CO monitor can be introduced only when complications emerge, it is recommended to monitor since before the induction in order to have a baseline.\nFluid administration in the intraoperative period is part of the daily practice in anaesthesiology. Several studies have demonstrated that the time of administering fluid therapy can be more important than the volume dispensed; thus the treatment guided by BP is primitive, whereas the functional parameters CO and SV can detect easily and quickly the preload variations\nIn the branch of medicine intensive care, the CO and other related parameters may be useful for the differential diagnosis of shock states such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic or septic.\n\n===The Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)===\nThe rise of volume is the main therapy elected to improve oxygen delivery. However, approximately, only 50% of subjects respond to fluids by increasing SV. The treatment of non-responsive patients can promote deleterious effects in the pulmonary system due to the increase in extravascular fluid. Hence it is important to have a tool to determine this condition.\nIt is called SVV to the physiological variations, due to changes in intra-thoracic pressure of spontaneous breathing, which diminish the arterial pulse pressure during inspiration and increase it during inspiration; however if the SVV decreases too much, it can be termed paradoxical pulse, and can be related to different pathologies such EPOC or pericarditis.\nIn mechanically ventilated patients, the same process takes place in reverse, due to the positive pressure. Therefore, the normal values of SVV depend on the ventilation mode, and it can be calculated through the SV with the formula: <math> SVV= (SV_{max} - SV_{min}) / SV_{mean} </math>, by a respiratory cycle or other period of time.\nDuring mechanical ventilation the goal is to maintain SVV between 10-15%, higher values along with a low SV may indicate the need of volume resuscitation.\n\n[[File:Stroke volume decresing.png|450px|center]]\n\nSVV may be fairly sensitive and specific used as a dynamic indicator of the volume status to answer the question: \u201cIs your patient fluid responsive?\u201d, compared to the conventional parameters. However, using the SVV should not be recommended to interpret the situation of patients with arrhythmias or vasodilator therapy. Also, to avoid natural variations, the patients must be under mechanical ventilation.\n\n==Therapy and methods==\n\n===The Goal Directed Therapy (GDT)===\nA critical point for the fluid management in some medical specialties is to adjust the intravascular volume replacement. An incorrect practice can seriously affect the organ function and hence the outcome. Guiding fluid management using standard physiologic variables such as BP and HR, because of their regulated nature, is usually insensitive to changes in intravascular volume and may be misleading for example occulting a hypo-perfusion state. Therefore, optimizing the cardiac preload with fluid administration guided by BP is not reliable.\n\nWith the formula to achieve objectives, called Goal Directed Therapy (GDT), Rivers (2001) demonstrated how to reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock through the optimization of different haemodynamic variables for a dynamic and individualized view, instead of maintaining only an adequate Arterial Pressure (AP). Later publications support that the intraoperative GDT, used to maintain an adequate systemic oxygenation, can safeguard organs especially sensible from perioperative hypo-perfusion. High risk patients or even less pernicious patients to major surgery could profit from GDT by reducing incidence of postoperative complications, thus, improving and accelerating the outcome.\n\nThe CO measurement in cardiology provides rewarding diagnostic and prognostic information for the management of patients with left- and right-sided cardiac dysfunction. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) may diminish the CO and promote right-sided heart failure, which untreated could be fatal. A simultaneous measurement of the preload also enables to assay the blood flow levels to discard states of hypovolemia or hypervolemia.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Rivers |first=E. |title= Early goal-directed therapy in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock |volume= 345 |issue=19 |date=2001 |journal= N.

Another option is the passive leg raising test, which consists of inducing a fast and transient hemodynamic challenge without fluid infusion. By modifying the patient\u2019s position, a volume of venous blood from the lower body toward the right heart it is transferred, simulating an infusion of approximately 300ml.\n\n[[File:Passive Leg Raising test.png|thumb|center| Figure 3: For maximal reliability, the PLR test must be performed following some rules. One possible variation of PLR starts from the semi-recumbent position 1. The second step comprises to go down the trunk and raise legs maintaining the angle between them using the automatic motion of the bed for avoiding artefacts. Finally the third step goes back to position 1 to ensure that the subject recovers the previous hemodynamic parameters.| 500px]]\n\nAn increase in the CO (of = 10%) and AP within the next 60\u201390 seconds after leg elevation indicates a positive result, suggesting that the patient is fluid responsive and might benefit from additional fluid. By contrast if the test is negative, the patient should not be treated as it would be harmful. The fluid overload can raise extravascular water causing deleterious side effects in lungs.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Monnet |first=X. |last2=Teboul |first2=J. |title= Passive leg raising?: five rules, not a drop of fluid! |date=2015 | pages= 1\u20133}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:CO Incresing.png|400px|center]]\n\n===The Frank Starling\u2019s curve===\nThe basic mechanisms for the haemodynamic regulation are:\n* Intrinsically cardiac regulation in function of the venous return.\n* Control of HR by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).\n\nThe explanation why the heart is capable of adapting to growing volumes of blood flow is called 'Frank-Starling\u2019s mechanism', which says that the more distended are the muscle during the filling, the more strength of contraction and quantity of blood pumped by the left-ventricle to the aorta. When the heart reaches a physiological limitation, then blood pumping cannot increase, although the venous return is further increased. The SVV contributes to know the state of volemia in ventilated patients and designates the point on the Frank-Starling curve where the patient is.<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mateu Campos |first=M.L. |last2=Ferr\u00e1ndiz Sell\u00e9s |first2=A. |last3= Gruartmoner de Vera |first3=G. |last4=Mesquida Febrer |first4=J. |last5=Sabatier Cloarec |first5=C. |last6=Poveda Hern\u00e1ndez |first6=Y. |last7=Garc\u00eda Nogales |first7=X. |title= Techniques available for hemodynamic monitoring.

Nowadays, it has become a widely used tool for study the ANS modulation in clinical areas such as cardiology. Even though, its utility is not well known yet. The interest lies in its profound relation with the breathing, ANS and cardiac autonomic regulation.\n\nThe most relevant and validated capacity is to prognosticate the coronary heart disease patients, accordingly, a reduced HRV is related to high risk of mortality after a myocardial infarction.\nAnother important point is the fact that the Inflammation is stimulated by effect of the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibited by the sympathetic, thereby, could also be measured through the R-R intervals to guide the physician.\n\nSeveral reports maintain that the HRV analysis is a highly accurate indicator of the autonomic dysfunction in alcoholic and diabetic subjects. Also, it is growing the interest in apply the HRV to evaluate the neurologic function, and the best results have been found out in the psychiatric patients.\nRegarding the anaesthesia and critical care fields, the ANS dysfunction should be considered because it is related to high morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia effect. Naturally, events as the tracheal intubation and inhalation agents can produce quick variations in ANS. Also, should be regarded in critical patients who may show a worse outcome when it is added to certain illnesses such as sepsis [24,25].\n<ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Mazzeo AT |first=S.L. |last2=La Monaca |first2=E. |last3= Di Leo |first3=R. |last4=Vita |first4=G. |title= Heart rate variability: a diagnostic and prognostic tool in anesthesia and intensive care |volume= 55 | issue = 7  |date=2011 |journal=  Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. | pages= 797\u2013811 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02466.x|pmid=21658013 }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |last=Huang |first=H.H. |last2=Chan |first2=H.L. |last3= Lin |first3=L. |last4=Wu |first4=C.P. |last5=Huang |first5=C.H. |title= Time-frequency spectral analysis of heart rate variability during induction of general anaesthesia |volume= 79 |issue=6 |date=1997 |journal=  Br.

Seeing them gathering to defend themselves, the sailors fired on them, by which they said four men were killed. This was before the natives were armed, but they found their mistake as soon as [[Wickaninnish]]'s warriors turned out, who with two canoes made the whaleboats fly.

She was loaned to [[Captain George Vancouver]] for this purpose in [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]] in 1793.<ref name=\"Vancouver\"/> \n\nThe squadron did not procure many furs on their first visit to the Northwest Coast. They wintered in the Hawaiian Islands and returned early the next year, in the Spring 1793. They had better success the 2nd year, and at the end of Autumn Captain Brown dispatched ''Butterworth'' to return to England around Cape Horn, picking up the sealing party he had left there, with the seal skins they were expected to have procured. Brown then sailed in to Canton in ''Prince Lee Boo'' with all the furs collected by the three ships.<ref name=\"Bishop\"/> According to Capt. George Vancouver, both ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' made this voyage to Canton.<ref name=\"Vancouver\"/>\n\n===Hawaii===\nThe Butterworth squadron first wintered at the Hawaiian Islands in February 1793, when control of the Islands was divided between [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha]] who controlled Hawai'i and much of Maui, and [[Kahekili II|Kahekili]] who controlled the islands west of Maui including Oahu and Kauai. Brown traded in weapons with both Kamehameha and Kahekili, but strongly favored the latter. In particular he entered into a contract with Kahekili giving Brown the title to the island of Oahu together with four islands to windward in return for weapons and military assistance, suppressing a revolt on Kauai.<ref name=\"Bishop\"/><ref name=\"Stokes\"/><ref name=\"Vancouver\"/> James Coleman, a seaman left in [[Ni'ihau]] by Captain Kendrick who had later joined Kehikili's forces, was given stewardship of the land for Capt. Brown and authority over foreign trade during Brown's absence.<ref name=\"Menzies\">Menzies, Archibald. ''Hawaii Nei 128 Years Ago''. Honolulu 1920</ref> Although the exact date is in question, it was probably during this period of alliance with Kahekili that the Butterworth squadron became the first European vessels allowed to enter the inner Honolulu Harbor. By Hawaiian tradition, this contract would have ended upon Kahekili's death in 1794<ref name=\"Stokes\"/>\n\n====Battle of Kuki'iahu====\n''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' returned to Oahu on 21 November 1794 to find a very different situation from the one they had left. On the death of Kahekili, his son [[Kalanikupule]] had succeeded him as ruler of Oahu, and Kahekili's half-brother Ka'eokulani, who had retained command of the Maui group of islands, was invading Oahu. This war became known as Kuki'iahu and was fought from November 16 until December 12, 1794.<ref name=\"Kamakau\"/>\n\nWhen ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' arrived at Honolulu, Kalanikupule requested their assistance in the battle. In return Brown was to receive 400 hogs, and according to some accounts, authority over the island of Oahu. Eight men under the command of George Lamport, mate of the Jackal, joined Kalanikupule's forces in a series battles ashore while Captain Brown and the remaining crew defended the shoreline from the ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo''.<ref name=\"Stokes\"/><ref name=\"Kamakau\"/>\n\n====''Jackall'' fires on ''Lady Washington''==== \nOn December 3, 1794, during the conflict, the American [[Snow (ship)|Snow]] [[Lady Washington]] arrived in Pearl Harbor where she was \"met with a very friendly reception by Capt. Brown.\"<ref name=\"Boit\"/> On December 6 a battle was fought, Kalanikupule was victorious.\n\nThe accounts differ as to what next happened. According to Captain Bishop of the British ship ''Ruby'', Kalanikupule \"came off and did homage to Brown as before, and at his return was saluted by one of the vessels, one of the guns happened to be shotted, which pierced the cabin of the American sloop [sic] and killed poor Kendrick at his table.\"<ref name=\"Bishop\"/>\n\nAccording to Capt. Boit of the American sloop ''Union'', Kendrick \"informed Capt. Brown that on the morrow he should cause the flag of the United States to be hoisted and fire a federal salute, which he begged might be answered by the two Englishmen, and it was accordingly agreed to, and Capt. Brown ordered three guns to be unshotted for that purpose, and about ten the next morning the ship ''Jackal'' began to salute, but on coming to the third gun it was discovered to be primed. So the apron of the fourth firearm was taken off which was fired and being shotted with round and grape shot, it pierced the side of the ''Lady Washington'' and killed Capt Kendrick as he sat at his table, and killed and wounded many upon the deck.\"<ref name=\"Boit\"/>\n\nJames Rowan, the mate of ''Lady Washington'' at the time, would later say that \"he had sworn since Captain Kendrick's death he would salute no vessel in a hurry, except at a safe distance.\"<ref name=\"Eliza\">Howay, F. W. ''The Ship Eliza in Hawaii 1799'' Annual Report of Hawaiian Historical Society, 1934</ref>\n\nCaptain Kendrick's body was buried ashore. Shortly thereafter ''Lady Washington'' sailed for Canton.<ref name=\"Boit\"/>\n[[File:Hawaiian Double Canoe with Women and Hogs, Bacstrom 1792.jpg|thumb|Hawaiian Double Canoe, Detail from Bacstrom]]\n\n====Capture of ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo''====\nKa'eokulani's invading forces were defeated on December 12. Soon after, a dispute arose between Capt. Brown and Kalanikupule over what was owed to Brown regarding his claims to Oahu and his obligations to Kalanikupule. The exact nature of this dispute is not clearly recorded, but it has been suggested that Kalanikupule may have requested that Brown and his men assist Kalanikupule in an attack against Kamehameha on Hawai'i, and Brown may have refused. If Brown did indeed have a land claim from Kalanikupule, this would have traditionally required him to serve in time of war, and to refuse would have been considered rebellion, punishable by death.<ref name=\"Stokes\"/>\n\nKalanikupule then decided to kill Captain Brown and capture ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo''. At his general's advice, he agreed to pay the 400 hogs. On January 1, 1795 the hogs were herded down to the beach to be slaughtered and salted down in barrels. But a great quantity of salt was needed for the task, so a party of men and a boat were sent some distance to collect it. As the mates of ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' told the story soon afterwards:\n\n\"When the greatest part of the crew of the ''Jackall'' being on shore salting pork and the remainder part away with their boat collecting salt, except [Capt. Brown] and one man, and part of the crew of the ''Prince Le Boo'' likewise on shore on duty, that the natives of the said island about ten a.m. on the 1st of January attacked the said vessel with several canoes, killed the commander William Brown and Robert Gordon and wounded several others and got possession of the vessel.\" <ref name=\"Bloxam\"/>\n\nKalanikupule and his generals then determined to attack Kamehameha's forces on Hawai'i. On January 3 the captured crew was put to work preparing the vessels for sea, and on January 11 they were ready to sail for Hawai'i. Kalanikupule ordered all of the arms and ammunition to be loaded into the two captured vessels, along with all the captured crew, although he was advised by his general to divide them among the canoes. This proved to be a fatal mistake.<ref name=\"Kamakau\"/>\n\nAccording to Lamport and Bonallack who were present, on {{quote|the 12th of January&nbsp;... about three p.m. the chiefs ordered the vessels out of the harbor to go to the bay of Waikiki where about 4 p.m we brought up and lay till ten p.m., and having all the people on board we both attacked the natives, wounded and drove them overboard and got possession of both vessels when we repaired to the island of Hawai'i.<ref name=\"Bloxam\"/>}}\n\nAnother early manuscript gives more detail:{{quote|The next afternoon, Mr. Bonallack, mate of the Lee Boo, coming on board the Jackal, agreed with Mr. Lamport to attempt retaking the ships at 11 o'clock that night. The Lee Boo took the lead and succeeded. Mr. Lamport, hearing before the appointed hour the report of a pistol from that vessel, ran from the cabin on deck, called to his men below that death or victory must issue in five minutes, and with only three of them armed, attacked twenty-three armed Indians on the quarterdeck, reserving their fire till close at hand, and then falling upon them with the butt end of their muskets, which soon broke.

Seeing them gathering to defend themselves, the sailors fired on them, by which they said four men were killed. This was before the natives were armed, but they found their mistake as soon as [[Wickaninnish]]'s warriors turned out, who with two canoes made the whaleboats fly.

She was loaned to [[Captain George Vancouver]] for this purpose in [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]] in 1793.<ref name=\"Vancouver\"/> \n\nThe squadron did not procure many furs on their first visit to the Northwest Coast. They wintered in the Hawaiian Islands and returned early the next year, in the Spring 1793. They had better success the 2nd year, and at the end of Autumn Captain Brown dispatched ''Butterworth'' to return to England around Cape Horn, picking up the sealing party he had left there, with the seal skins they were expected to have procured. Brown then sailed in to Canton in ''Prince Lee Boo'' with all the furs collected by the three ships.<ref name=\"Bishop\"/> According to Capt. George Vancouver, both ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' made this voyage to Canton.<ref name=\"Vancouver\"/>\n\n===Hawaii===\nThe Butterworth squadron first wintered at the Hawaiian Islands in February 1793, when control of the Islands was divided between [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha]] who controlled Hawai'i and much of Maui, and [[Kahekili II|Kahekili]] who controlled the islands west of Maui including Oahu and Kauai. Brown traded in weapons with both Kamehameha and Kahekili, but strongly favored the latter. In particular he entered into a contract with Kahekili giving Brown the title to the island of Oahu together with four islands to windward in return for weapons and military assistance, suppressing a revolt on Kauai.<ref name=\"Bishop\"/><ref name=\"Stokes\"/><ref name=\"Vancouver\"/> James Coleman, a seaman left in [[Ni'ihau]] by Captain Kendrick who had later joined Kehikili's forces, was given stewardship of the land for Capt. Brown and authority over foreign trade during Brown's absence.<ref name=\"Menzies\">Menzies, Archibald. ''Hawaii Nei 128 Years Ago''. Honolulu 1920</ref> Although the exact date is in question, it was probably during this period of alliance with Kahekili that the Butterworth squadron became the first European vessels allowed to enter the inner Honolulu Harbor. By Hawaiian tradition, this contract would have ended upon Kahekili's death in 1794<ref name=\"Stokes\"/>\n\n====Battle of Kuki'iahu====\n''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' returned to Oahu on 21 November 1794 to find a very different situation from the one they had left. On the death of Kahekili, his son [[Kalanikupule]] had succeeded him as ruler of Oahu, and Kahekili's half-brother Ka'eokulani, who had retained command of the Maui group of islands, was invading Oahu. This war became known as Kuki'iahu and was fought from November 16 until December 12, 1794.<ref name=\"Kamakau\"/>\n\nWhen ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' arrived at Honolulu, Kalanikupule requested their assistance in the battle. In return Brown was to receive 400 hogs, and according to some accounts, authority over the island of Oahu. Eight men under the command of George Lamport, mate of the Jackal, joined Kalanikupule's forces in a series battles ashore while Captain Brown and the remaining crew defended the shoreline from the ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo''.<ref name=\"Stokes\"/><ref name=\"Kamakau\"/>\n\n====''Jackall'' fires on ''Lady Washington''==== \nOn December 3, 1794, during the conflict, the American [[Snow (ship)|Snow]] [[Lady Washington]] arrived in Pearl Harbor where she was \"met with a very friendly reception by Capt. Brown.\"<ref name=\"Boit\"/> On December 6 a battle was fought, Kalanikupule was victorious.\n\nThe accounts differ as to what next happened. According to Captain Bishop of the British ship ''Ruby'', Kalanikupule \"came off and did homage to Brown as before, and at his return was saluted by one of the vessels, one of the guns happened to be shotted, which pierced the cabin of the American sloop [sic] and killed poor Kendrick at his table.\"<ref name=\"Bishop\"/>\n\nAccording to Capt. Boit of the American sloop ''Union'', Kendrick \"informed Capt. Brown that on the morrow he should cause the flag of the United States to be hoisted and fire a federal salute, which he begged might be answered by the two Englishmen, and it was accordingly agreed to, and Capt. Brown ordered three guns to be unshotted for that purpose, and about ten the next morning the ship ''Jackal'' began to salute, but on coming to the third gun it was discovered to be primed. So the apron of the fourth firearm was taken off which was fired and being shotted with round and grape shot, it pierced the side of the ''Lady Washington'' and killed Capt Kendrick as he sat at his table, and killed and wounded many upon the deck.\"<ref name=\"Boit\"/>\n\nJames Rowan, the mate of ''Lady Washington'' at the time, would later say that \"he had sworn since Captain Kendrick's death he would salute no vessel in a hurry, except at a safe distance.\"<ref name=\"Eliza\">Howay, F. W. ''The Ship Eliza in Hawaii 1799'' Annual Report of Hawaiian Historical Society, 1934</ref>\n\nCaptain Kendrick's body was buried ashore. Shortly thereafter ''Lady Washington'' sailed for Canton.<ref name=\"Boit\"/>\n[[File:Hawaiian Double Canoe with Women and Hogs, Bacstrom 1792.jpg|thumb|Hawaiian Double Canoe, Detail from Bacstrom]]\n\n====Capture of ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo''====\nKa'eokulani's invading forces were defeated on December 12. Soon after, a dispute arose between Capt. Brown and Kalanikupule over what was owed to Brown regarding his claims to Oahu and his obligations to Kalanikupule. The exact nature of this dispute is not clearly recorded, but it has been suggested that Kalanikupule may have requested that Brown and his men assist Kalanikupule in an attack against Kamehameha on Hawai'i, and Brown may have refused. If Brown did indeed have a land claim from Kalanikupule, this would have traditionally required him to serve in time of war, and to refuse would have been considered rebellion, punishable by death.<ref name=\"Stokes\"/>\n\nKalanikupule then decided to kill Captain Brown and capture ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo''. At his general's advice, he agreed to pay the 400 hogs. On January 1, 1795 the hogs were herded down to the beach to be slaughtered and salted down in barrels. But a great quantity of salt was needed for the task, so a party of men and a boat were sent some distance to collect it. As the mates of ''Jackal'' and ''Prince Lee Boo'' told the story soon afterwards:\n\n\"When the greatest part of the crew of the ''Jackall'' being on shore salting pork and the remainder part away with their boat collecting salt, except [Capt. Brown] and one man, and part of the crew of the ''Prince Le Boo'' likewise on shore on duty, that the natives of the said island about ten a.m. on the 1st of January attacked the said vessel with several canoes, killed the commander William Brown and Robert Gordon and wounded several others and got possession of the vessel.\" <ref name=\"Bloxam\"/>\n\nKalanikupule and his generals then determined to attack Kamehameha's forces on Hawai'i. On January 3 the captured crew was put to work preparing the vessels for sea, and on January 11 they were ready to sail for Hawai'i. Kalanikupule ordered all of the arms and ammunition to be loaded into the two captured vessels, along with all the captured crew, although he was advised by his general to divide them among the canoes. This proved to be a fatal mistake.<ref name=\"Kamakau\"/>\n\nAccording to Lamport and Bonallack who were present, on {{quote|the 12th of January&nbsp;... about three p.m. the chiefs ordered the vessels out of the harbor to go to the bay of Waikiki where about 4 p.m we brought up and lay till ten p.m., and having all the people on board we both attacked the natives, wounded and drove them overboard and got possession of both vessels when we repaired to the island of Hawai'i.<ref name=\"Bloxam\"/>}}\n\nAnother early manuscript gives more detail:{{quote|The next afternoon, Mr. Bonallack, mate of the Lee Boo, coming on board the Jackal, agreed with Mr. Lamport to attempt retaking the ships at 11 o'clock that night. The Lee Boo took the lead and succeeded. Mr. Lamport, hearing before the appointed hour the report of a pistol from that vessel, ran from the cabin on deck, called to his men below that death or victory must issue in five minutes, and with only three of them armed, attacked twenty-three armed Indians on the quarterdeck, reserving their fire till close at hand, and then falling upon them with the butt end of their muskets, which soon broke.

Walker used most of the money to pay off his delinquent debts and to move his family into better neighborhoods, but he also set aside some for future investment, such as turning around the fortunes of his money-losing bar by hiring a skilled bartender.<ref name=\"crime\"/> While Walker occasionally used the services of his wife, Barbara Walker, he anticipated the possibility of losing access due to reassignment. Walker's chance to seek further assistance came in September 1969 when he became the deputy director of the radioman A and B schools at the [[Naval Training Center San Diego]].<ref name=wec/> There, Walker befriended student [[Jerry Whitworth]].<ref name=\"crime\"/>\n\nWalker was transferred from San Diego in December 1971 to become the [[communications officer]] aboard the supply ship {{USS|Niagara Falls|AFS-3|6}}.<ref name=wec/> Whitworth, who would become a Navy senior chief petty officer/senior chief radioman, agreed to help Walker gain access to highly classified communications data in 1973;<ref name=\"crime\"/> and served aboard ''Niagara Falls'' after Walker retired from the Navy. Transfer to the staff of commander of the [[Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet]]<ref name=wec/> had stopped Walker's access to the data the Soviets wanted; but he recruited Whitworth to keep the data flowing \u2013 softening the idea of espionage by telling him the data would go to [[Israel]], an ally of the United States. Later, when Whitworth realized the data was going to the Soviets instead of Israel, he nonetheless continued supplying Walker with information, until Whitworth's retirement from the Navy in 1983.\n\nIn 1976, Walker retired from the Navy in order to give up his security clearance, as he believed certain superior officers of his were too keen on investigating lapses in his records. Walker and Barbara had also divorced. However, Walker did not end his espionage, and began looking more aggressively among his children and family members for assistance (Walker was a [[private investigator]] during this time). By 1984, he had recruited his older brother Arthur, a retired [[lieutenant commander]] who then went to work at a [[arms industry|military contractor]], and his son Michael, an active duty seaman.<ref name=\"crime\"/> Walker had also attempted to recruit his youngest daughter, who had enlisted in the [[United States Army]], but she cut her military career short when she became pregnant and refused her father's offer to pay for an abortion, instead deciding to devote herself to full-time motherhood. Walker then turned his attention to his son, who had drifted during much of his teenage years and [[high school dropouts|dropped out]] of high school. Walker gained custody of his son, put him to work as an apprentice at his detective agency in order to prepare him for espionage and encouraged him to re-enroll in high school to earn a diploma, then to enlist in the Navy.\n\nWhen Walker began spying, he worked as a key supervisor in the communications center for the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's submarine force, and he would have had knowledge of top-secret technologies, such as the [[SOSUS]] underwater surveillance system, which tracks underwater acoustics via a network of submerged [[hydrophone]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=The John Walker Spy Case: Secrets of the Deep Agent May be Linked to USS ''Pueblo'' |date=May 18, 1986 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1986/8601100536.asp |url-status=dead |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_27/asw.html |title=Cold War Strategic ASW |issue=27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618092756/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_27/asw.html |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |year=1986}}</ref> It was through Walker that the Soviets became aware that the U.S. Navy was able to track the location of Soviet submarines by the [[cavitation]] produced by their propellers.

CIA historian [[H. Keith Melton]] states on the show ''Top Secrets of the CIA'', which aired on the [[Military Channel]], among other occasions, at 0400CST, February 5, 2013:\n\n{{quote|[The Soviets] had intercepted our coded messages, but they had never been able to read them. And with Walker providing the code cards, this was one-half of what they needed to read the messages. The other half they needed were the machines themselves. Though Walker could give them repair manuals, he couldn't give them machines. So, within a month of John Walker volunteering his services, the Soviets arranged, through the North Koreans, to hijack a United States Navy ship with its cipher machines, and that was the USS ''Pueblo''. And in early 1968 they captured the ''Pueblo'', they took it into [[Wonsan]] Harbor, they quickly took the machines off&nbsp;... flew 'em to Moscow. Now Moscow had both parts of the puzzles.

Their marriage was marked by physical abuse and alcohol. By 1980 Barbara had begun regularly abusing alcohol and was very fearful for her children. She wanted the children not to become involved in the spy ring; that led to constant disagreement with John. Barbara tried several times to contact the Boston office of the FBI, but she either hung up or was too drunk to speak. In November 1984 she again contacted the Boston office and in a drunken confession reported that her ex-husband spied for the Soviet Union. She did not then know that Michael had become an active participant; she later admitted she would not have reported the spy ring had she known her son was involved.<ref name=\"crime\"/>\n\nThe Boston office of the FBI interviewed Barbara Walker and initially considered her story to be the rantings of a drunken, bitter woman trying to \"drop a dime\" on an ex-husband. Since Barbara's report regarded a person who lived in Virginia, the Boston office sent the report to the Norfolk office.  When the FBI in Norfolk reviewed the report the counterintelligence squad concluded it might be a truthful report and initiated a discreet investigation. The FBI conducted an interview of Walker's daughter, Laura, who confirmed that her father was a KGB spy and said that he had tried to recruit her into his espionage ring while she was in the U.S. Army.\n\nWhen both Barbara Walker and Laura Walker passed polygraph examinations, electronic surveillance was authorized by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] against John Walker. In May 1985 the FBI learned through the electronic surveillance that it was likely that John Walker would travel out of town on the weekend of May 18 and 19, 1985. On May 19 Walker left his house in Norfolk and was followed covertly by the FBI to the Washington, D.C., area, where the surveillance was joined by personnel from the FBI's Washington field office.  Later that evening about 8:30&nbsp;p.m. he drove to a rural area in Montgomery County, Maryland, where he was seen placing a package in a wooded area near a \"No Hunting\" sign.  The FBI retrieved the package that was found to have 124 pages of classified information stolen from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Nimitz}}, where Walker's son, Michael, was assigned. John Walker was arrested during the early morning hours of May 20, 1985, by a team of agents from the Norfolk and Washington FBI field offices.  The FBI apprehended Walker himself at a motel in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], by using, ironically, a trick he had used to catch people in adultery cases\u2014that is, by telephoning his hotel room and telling him that his car had been hit in an accident.<ref name=\"crime\"/>  Barbara Walker was not prosecuted because of her role in disclosing the ring.<ref name=\"crime\"/><ref name=\"NCIX\"/> Former KGB agent [[Victor Cherkashin]], however, describes in his book ''Spy Handler'' that Walker was compromised by FBI spy Valery Martynov, who overheard officials in Moscow speaking about Walker.<ref>Cherkashin, Victor. Spy Handler. New York: Basic Books, 2005. (Page 183)</ref>\n\nMichael Walker was arrested aboard ''Nimitz'', where investigators found a footlocker full of copies of classified matter. He had to be taken off his ship under guard to avoid getting beaten by sailors and Marines. Arthur Walker and Jerry Whitworth were arrested by the FBI in Norfolk, Virginia, and Sacramento, California, respectively. Arthur Walker was the first member of the espionage ring to go to trial. During the arrest of Arthur Walker, he was read his rights and repeatedly told he needed to stay silent until he could retain a lawyer, but kept admitting complicity in an effort to \"show remorse\". He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to three life sentences in a federal district court in Norfolk.\n\nWalker cooperated somewhat with authorities, enough to form a plea bargain that reduced the sentence for his son. He agreed to submit to an unchallenged conviction and life sentence, to provide a full disclosure of the details of his spying and to testify against Whitworth in exchange for a pledge from the prosecutors that the maximum sentence requested for Michael was 25 years imprisonment, which was later Michael's sentence.<ref name=\"CNN\"/><ref name=\"time\">''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960320-1,00.html Belated concern], Time Inc.

Walker used most of the money to pay off his delinquent debts and to move his family into better neighborhoods, but he also set aside some for future investment, such as turning around the fortunes of his money-losing bar by hiring a skilled bartender.<ref name=\"crime\"/> While Walker occasionally used the services of his wife, Barbara Walker, he anticipated the possibility of losing access due to reassignment. Walker's chance to seek further assistance came in September 1969 when he became the deputy director of the radioman A and B schools at the [[Naval Training Center San Diego]].<ref name=wec/> There, Walker befriended student [[Jerry Whitworth]].<ref name=\"crime\"/>\n\nWalker was transferred from San Diego in December 1971 to become the [[communications officer]] aboard the supply ship {{USS|Niagara Falls|AFS-3|6}}.<ref name=wec/> Whitworth, who would become a Navy senior chief petty officer/senior chief radioman, agreed to help Walker gain access to highly classified communications data in 1973;<ref name=\"crime\"/> and served aboard ''Niagara Falls'' after Walker retired from the Navy. Transfer to the staff of commander of the [[Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet]]<ref name=wec/> had stopped Walker's access to the data the Soviets wanted; but he recruited Whitworth to keep the data flowing \u2013 softening the idea of espionage by telling him the data would go to [[Israel]], an ally of the United States. Later, when Whitworth realized the data was going to the Soviets instead of Israel, he nonetheless continued supplying Walker with information, until Whitworth's retirement from the Navy in 1983.\n\nIn 1976, Walker retired from the Navy in order to give up his security clearance, as he believed certain superior officers of his were too keen on investigating lapses in his records. Walker and Barbara had also divorced. However, Walker did not end his espionage, and began looking more aggressively among his children and family members for assistance (Walker was a [[private investigator]] during this time). By 1984, he had recruited his older brother Arthur, a retired [[lieutenant commander]] who then went to work at a [[arms industry|military contractor]], and his son Michael, an active duty seaman.<ref name=\"crime\"/> Walker had also attempted to recruit his youngest daughter, who had enlisted in the [[United States Army]], but she cut her military career short when she became pregnant and refused her father's offer to pay for an abortion, instead deciding to devote herself to full-time motherhood. Walker then turned his attention to his son, who had drifted during much of his teenage years and [[high school dropouts|dropped out]] of high school. Walker gained custody of his son, put him to work as an apprentice at his detective agency in order to prepare him for espionage and encouraged him to re-enroll in high school to earn a diploma, then to enlist in the Navy.\n\nWhen Walker began spying, he worked as a key supervisor in the communications center for the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's submarine force, and he would have had knowledge of top-secret technologies, such as the [[SOSUS]] underwater surveillance system, which tracks underwater acoustics via a network of submerged [[hydrophone]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=The John Walker Spy Case: Secrets of the Deep Agent May be Linked to USS ''Pueblo'' |date=May 18, 1986 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1986/8601100536.asp |url-status=dead |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |archive-url= |archive-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_27/asw.html |title=Cold War Strategic ASW |issue=27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618092756/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_27/asw.html |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |year=1986}}</ref> It was through Walker that the Soviets became aware that the U.S. Navy was able to track the location of Soviet submarines by the [[cavitation]] produced by their propellers.

And with Walker providing the code cards, this was one-half of what they needed to read the messages. The other half they needed were the machines themselves. Though Walker could give them repair manuals, he couldn't give them machines. So, within a month of John Walker volunteering his services, the Soviets arranged, through the North Koreans, to hijack a United States Navy ship with its cipher machines, and that was the USS ''Pueblo''. And in early 1968 they captured the ''Pueblo'', they took it into [[Wonsan]] Harbor, they quickly took the machines off&nbsp;... flew 'em to Moscow. Now Moscow had both parts of the puzzles.

Their marriage was marked by physical abuse and alcohol. By 1980 Barbara had begun regularly abusing alcohol and was very fearful for her children. She wanted the children not to become involved in the spy ring; that led to constant disagreement with John. Barbara tried several times to contact the Boston office of the FBI, but she either hung up or was too drunk to speak. In November 1984 she again contacted the Boston office and in a drunken confession reported that her ex-husband spied for the Soviet Union. She did not then know that Michael had become an active participant; she later admitted she would not have reported the spy ring had she known her son was involved.<ref name=\"crime\"/>\n\nThe Boston office of the FBI interviewed Barbara Walker and initially considered her story to be the rantings of a drunken, bitter woman trying to \"drop a dime\" on an ex-husband. Since Barbara's report regarded a person who lived in Virginia, the Boston office sent the report to the Norfolk office.  When the FBI in Norfolk reviewed the report the counterintelligence squad concluded it might be a truthful report and initiated a discreet investigation. The FBI conducted an interview of Walker's daughter, Laura, who confirmed that her father was a KGB spy and said that he had tried to recruit her into his espionage ring while she was in the U.S. Army.\n\nWhen both Barbara Walker and Laura Walker passed polygraph examinations, electronic surveillance was authorized by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] against John Walker. In May 1985 the FBI learned through the electronic surveillance that it was likely that John Walker would travel out of town on the weekend of May 18 and 19, 1985. On May 19 Walker left his house in Norfolk and was followed covertly by the FBI to the Washington, D.C., area, where the surveillance was joined by personnel from the FBI's Washington field office.  Later that evening about 8:30&nbsp;p.m. he drove to a rural area in Montgomery County, Maryland, where he was seen placing a package in a wooded area near a \"No Hunting\" sign.  The FBI retrieved the package that was found to have 124 pages of classified information stolen from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Nimitz}}, where Walker's son, Michael, was assigned. John Walker was arrested during the early morning hours of May 20, 1985, by a team of agents from the Norfolk and Washington FBI field offices.  The FBI apprehended Walker himself at a motel in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], by using, ironically, a trick he had used to catch people in adultery cases\u2014that is, by telephoning his hotel room and telling him that his car had been hit in an accident.<ref name=\"crime\"/>  Barbara Walker was not prosecuted because of her role in disclosing the ring.<ref name=\"crime\"/><ref name=\"NCIX\"/> Former KGB agent [[Victor Cherkashin]], however, describes in his book ''Spy Handler'' that Walker was compromised by FBI spy Valery Martynov, who overheard officials in Moscow speaking about Walker.<ref>Cherkashin, Victor. Spy Handler. New York: Basic Books, 2005. (Page 183)</ref>\n\nMichael Walker was arrested aboard ''Nimitz'', where investigators found a footlocker full of copies of classified matter. He had to be taken off his ship under guard to avoid getting beaten by sailors and Marines. Arthur Walker and Jerry Whitworth were arrested by the FBI in Norfolk, Virginia, and Sacramento, California, respectively. Arthur Walker was the first member of the espionage ring to go to trial. During the arrest of Arthur Walker, he was read his rights and repeatedly told he needed to stay silent until he could retain a lawyer, but kept admitting complicity in an effort to \"show remorse\". He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to three life sentences in a federal district court in Norfolk.\n\nWalker cooperated somewhat with authorities, enough to form a plea bargain that reduced the sentence for his son. He agreed to submit to an unchallenged conviction and life sentence, to provide a full disclosure of the details of his spying and to testify against Whitworth in exchange for a pledge from the prosecutors that the maximum sentence requested for Michael was 25 years imprisonment, which was later Michael's sentence.<ref name=\"CNN\"/><ref name=\"time\">''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960320-1,00.html Belated concern], Time Inc.

The tension resulted in the castle being seized and burned down by an angry mob in collaboration with the King's forces. The King's forces would later, after ending their north-going campaign on Funen, return to pillage and plunder Svendborg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svendborgo.dk/lokalhistorie/index.html|title=Krig og fred: Svendborg lokalhistorie|publisher=Svendborgo.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1536, Svendborg went through a brief period of progress becoming the islands main port. But it would not last for long. In the following 250 years, the city faced various setbacks in its development, such as [[Bubonic plague|plague]], a major fire, and the effects of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)|Swedish wars]] when Svendborg's ships were destroyed.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\n===Industrial development===\n\nIt was not until the end of the [[Gunboat War|war with England]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the early 19th century that the city returned to a period of increasing prosperity. The population grew from a mere 1,942 people in 1801 to more than 11,500 in 1901. This development was followed by improvement of the infrastructure, such as rail links with [[Odense]], [[Faaborg]] and [[Nyborg]], improvement of the local roads and the establishment of a real harbour suited for extensive trading, since goods could now easily be transported there. In the middle of the 19th century an explosion of industrialization happened, and all kinds of factories, from engineering to breweries were established together with modern gas and water systems.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nIn the late 19th century, with industry well established, it was necessary to accommodate the growing population. This led to numerous new schools being founded. Furthermore, a hospital was established in 1871 and expanded in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fynhistorie.dis-danmark.dk/node/390|title=Svendborgs historie|publisher=fynhistorie.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[File:Svendborg dk hafen.JPG|thumb|left|Svendborg Harbour]]\nThe rapid increase in population continued at the beginning of the 20th century as Svendborg developed into an even more important industrial and educational centre. The food and metallurgy sectors became well established. The port prospered with new facilities, including shipyards such as Svendborg Skibsv\u00e6rft which was established in 1907 on an artificial island. On the educational front, a number of maritime and navigational schools were established. The shipyard, which had employed up to 800 in the 1980s finally closed in 2001, some of the facilities being taken over by [[Vestas]]. In recent years, there has been a marked transition from industry into the service sector, the hospital now being one of the principal employers. Tourism has also prospered, especially for those arriving in pleasure boats.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nThe German writer [[Bertolt Brecht]] spent the first years of his exile from Nazi Germany in Svendborg.

({{IPA-da|\u02c8sven\u02ccp\u0252\u02c0|lang}}) is a town on the island of [[Funen]] in south-central [[Denmark]], and the seat of  [[Svendborg Municipality]]. With a population of 27,210 (1 January 2019), Svendborg is Funen's second largest city.<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> In 2000 Svendborg was declared \"Town of the year\" in Denmark, and in 2003 it celebrated its 750th anniversary as a [[market town]].

The defense system also included a few of forts. Most historical facts about the medieval defense system, including the locations of fortifications, are disputed, as little archaeological evidence has been generated. In spite of this, it is a popular theory that the three towers in the coat of arms are the three fortifications (\"Skattert\u00e5rnet\", \"Kyseborg\" and a third one unnamed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fynhistorie.dis-danmark.dk/node/27923|title=Skattert\u00e5rnet|publisher=fynhistorie.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref> Thanks to its seafarers, in the late Middle Ages Svendborg became one of the most important trading centres in Scandinavia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsvendborg.dk/fyn/historie/svendborg-hovedstaden-i-det-sydfynske-oehav|title=Allerede i 1200-tallet var Svendborg et betydeligt bysamfund, vokset op i ly af den beskyttede naturhavn, en lille bugt, der p\u00e5 det smalleste sted i Svendborgsund sk\u00e6rer sig ind i Fyn|publisher=Visit Svendborg|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=}}</ref>\n\n===16th and 17th centuries===\n\nDuring the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant reformation]] and the [[Count's Feud]] in the 1530s, the citizens of Svendborg joined forces with the [[Christian II of Denmark|King]]. \u00d8rkild Castle, located just east of Svendborg, was property of the bishop of [[Odense]], who was less than popular among the citizens of the city. The tension resulted in the castle being seized and burned down by an angry mob in collaboration with the King's forces. The King's forces would later, after ending their north-going campaign on Funen, return to pillage and plunder Svendborg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svendborgo.dk/lokalhistorie/index.html|title=Krig og fred: Svendborg lokalhistorie|publisher=Svendborgo.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1536, Svendborg went through a brief period of progress becoming the islands main port. But it would not last for long. In the following 250 years, the city faced various setbacks in its development, such as [[Bubonic plague|plague]], a major fire, and the effects of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)|Swedish wars]] when Svendborg's ships were destroyed.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\n===Industrial development===\n\nIt was not until the end of the [[Gunboat War|war with England]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the early 19th century that the city returned to a period of increasing prosperity. The population grew from a mere 1,942 people in 1801 to more than 11,500 in 1901. This development was followed by improvement of the infrastructure, such as rail links with [[Odense]], [[Faaborg]] and [[Nyborg]], improvement of the local roads and the establishment of a real harbour suited for extensive trading, since goods could now easily be transported there. In the middle of the 19th century an explosion of industrialization happened, and all kinds of factories, from engineering to breweries were established together with modern gas and water systems.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nIn the late 19th century, with industry well established, it was necessary to accommodate the growing population. This led to numerous new schools being founded. Furthermore, a hospital was established in 1871 and expanded in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fynhistorie.dis-danmark.dk/node/390|title=Svendborgs historie|publisher=fynhistorie.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[File:Svendborg dk hafen.JPG|thumb|left|Svendborg Harbour]]\nThe rapid increase in population continued at the beginning of the 20th century as Svendborg developed into an even more important industrial and educational centre. The food and metallurgy sectors became well established. The port prospered with new facilities, including shipyards such as Svendborg Skibsv\u00e6rft which was established in 1907 on an artificial island. On the educational front, a number of maritime and navigational schools were established. The shipyard, which had employed up to 800 in the 1980s finally closed in 2001, some of the facilities being taken over by [[Vestas]]. In recent years, there has been a marked transition from industry into the service sector, the hospital now being one of the principal employers. Tourism has also prospered, especially for those arriving in pleasure boats.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nThe German writer [[Bertolt Brecht]] spent the first years of his exile from Nazi Germany in Svendborg.
