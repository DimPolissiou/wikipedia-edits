Their names contain numbers 1~7 in kanji. Their music symbols mainly consist of [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]] and [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]].\n\n;{{nihongo|Iori Izumi|\u548c\u6cc9 \u4e00\u7e54|Izumi Iori}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Toshiki Masuda]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|title=UNIT|url=http://idolish7.com/unit/|website=\u3010\u516c\u5f0f\u3011\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30bb\u30d6\u30f3|accessdate=17 September 2017|language=Japanese}}</ref>}}\n: The rational and brilliant member of the group. Calm and polite, he is able to complete any task flawlessly, but is actually fairly sharp-tongued when he talks. He acts a secret, second manager for the group as he advises Tsumugi on what he believes is best for the group. He originally became an idol to help fulfill his brother Mitsuki's dream, but begins to really enjoy the work and people around him. He is still in high school and attends the same school as Tamaki. It is shown that he loves cute things though he will never admit it. 17 years old.<ref name=\"profile\">{{cite web|title=Anime Spotlight - IDOLiSH7|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anime-spotlight/2017/winter/idolish7/.125159|website=Anime News Network|language=English}}</ref> His music symbol is [[Flat (music)|double flat]] and he represents the number one.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yamato Nikaid\u014d|\u4e8c\u968e\u5802 \u5927\u548c|Nikaid\u014d Yamato}}\n:{{voiced by|Y\u016bsuke Shirai<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The eldest member of the group and a big brother figure to the other members. He is Idolish7's leader and is regarded as their \"acting genius\" with multiple people praising his skills. Although he appears to have an aloof personality, he is in fact very passionate on the inside, and thinks about the other members of the group more than anyone else. He claims to hate the entertainment industry and only entered it to \"get revenge\" on someone, but has abandoned that motive after he sees how hard everyone works. Despite this, it is shown that he is keeping a secret. 22 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] and he represents the number two.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mitsuki Izumi|\u548c\u6cc9 \u4e09\u6708|Izumi Mitsuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The energetic member of the group who always sets the mood and Iori's older brother. He is caring and has a chivalrous spirit. His dream is to become as big and inspirational as the legendary idol Zero. He originally failed the audition multiple times before he was accepted which has caused him to be insecure at times, but has learned what his special skills are (MCing and comedy) and how he fits in to the group. He has a height complex as he is the shortest member in the group. 21 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Flat (music)|flat]] and he represents the number three.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tamaki Yotsuba|\u56db\u8449 \u74b0|Yotsuba Tamaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kenn (Japanese actor)|KENN]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The dancing genius of the group, he has great reflexes and has a dancing level equivalent to professionals. Tamaki is shown to be quite emotionally driven and aggressive, but always has good intentions. He moves at his own pace, and is just a little bit loose when it comes to being on time and keeping promises. He attends the same high school as Iori and often has to be dragged there by him. He grew up in an orphanage after his father abandoned their family and his mother died of an illness. While at the orphanage, his younger sister Aya was fostered and therefore he lost touch with her. He became an idol in order to find Aya as idols are on TV or radio often so she knew where to find him. Due to growing up poor, he has a love for King Pudding which can be used to win him over quite easily. He is part of the sub-unit, MEZZO, along with Sogo. 17 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Dynamics (music)|mezzo piano]] and he represents the number four.\n\n;{{nihongo|S\u014dgo \u014csaka|\u9022\u5742 \u58ee\u4e94|\u014csaka S\u014dgo}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Abe]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The \"all-rounder\" member who is able to handle any song and dance with no problem. He is kind, selfless and reserved to everyone, but is the scariest member when angered. His selfless nature however has caused him to have difficulties expressing his emotions and his concerns when he begins to have a difficult time. He grew up in a wealthier family who disapproved of his love for music with the exception of his late uncle who inspired him to follow his dream of becoming an idol. Due to his rebellion, he is shown to have a strained relationship with his family. He and Tamaki form the sub-unit, MEZZO. 20 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Dynamics (music)|mezzo forte]] and he represents the number five.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagi Rokuya|\u516d\u5f25\u30ca\u30ae|Rokuya Nagi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takuya Eguchi]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The visual member of the group who speaks in broken Japanese. He is half- Japanese and half Northmeran (a fictional northern European country). He decides to move from Northmare to Japan after he fell in love with Japanese pop culture especially [[Anime|Japanese animation]] with his favorite being Mahou Shoujo Magical\u2605Kokona. He is fully confident in his looks, has a lot of charisma, and has a habit of immediately hitting on any girl he sees. Due to this habit, he has trouble making friends with others and deeply cares about the other members as they are his first friends. Despite his seemingly ditzy personality, he actually is very smart as he is able to speak 8 languages and is very knowledgable about political topics. 19 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Natural (music)|natural]] and he represents the number six.\n\n;{{nihongo|Riku Nanase|\u4e03\u702c \u9678|Nanase Riku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kensh\u014d Ono]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The center member of the group and is regarded as their \"secret weapon.\" He is a very innocent and energetic, but is quite naive on how the world actually works resulting in him being a bit of a pushover. He is very direct with how he is feeling and can be insensitive at times as he is unable to read how the others around him are feeling, but is always there to help others. He has an unknown respiratory disease that has left him hospitalized for most of his life and prevents him from doing anything that is too physically intense. Despite this, he does not allow his illness to stop him and works very hard to become a top idol. It is revealed that he is the twin brother of Tenn Kujo, who left the Nanase family five years ago. He originally became an idol to understand why his brother abandoned his family to enter this business. 18 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Sharp (music)|double sharp]] and he represents the number seven.\n\n===Trigger===\nThe rival group of Idolish7 that belongs to the Yaotome Production Company.

He is quite competitive and blunt when he speaks to others, but truly is very cordial and caring. He places a great emphasis on family believing it is the most important part of life which puts him at odds with those who do not care about family bonds. He is the son of Sosuke Yaotome, the president of Yaotome Productions, who groomed at a young age to become an idol. 22 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Clef#Treble clef|treble]] and he represents the number eight.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tenn Kuj\u014d|\u4e5d\u6761 \u5929|Kuj\u014d Tenn}}\n:{{voiced by|[[S\u014dma Sait\u014d]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The center of Trigger who is nicknamed \"A Modern Day Angel.\" Off stage, he is serious and cold towards others due to his perfectionist attitude and the great pride he takes in his work. He is shown not to want to inconvenience others and values the hard work of everyone around him which is why he maintains a high level of professionalism most of the time. However, Tenn truly is a kind and selfless person who cares deeply about the people around him. It is revealed that he is the twin brother of Riku Nanase and that he left his family five years ago to pursue his dream of being the greatest idol. Despite leaving the family, he secretly cares a great deal about his little brother and always thinks about his well- being. 18 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Clef#Alto clef|alto]] and he represents the number nine. \n\n;{{nihongo|Ry\u016bnosuke Tsunashi|\u5341 \u9f8d\u4e4b\u4ecb|Tsunashi Ry\u016bnosuke}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takuya Sat\u014d (voice actor)|Takuya Sat\u014d]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\n: The last member of Trigger and the group's \"big brother\" figure. Born in Okinawa, he moved to Tokyo in order to become an idol to make enough money to put his younger siblings through college and pay off his father's debts. He is marketed to the public as wild and sexy with a playboy attitude. However, Ryunosuke is the exact opposite of this as he truly is very kind, loving and shy. The gap between his true personality and his public image causes him to worry at times. He is shown to be the peacemaker when arguments break out. 23 years old.<ref name=\"profile\" /> His music symbol is [[Clef#Bass clef|bass]] and he represents the number ten.\n\n===Re:vale===\nAn idol group that introduced in the second chapter of the game. Their names contain numbers 100 and 1000 in kanji.

Momo has a bit of a mischievous side and seems to drag Yuki into his schemes. It is shown that he is very observant of his surroundings and wishes to protect anyone in any way he can. This, however, results in him often ignoring the care and attention he needs himself. He is the ''[[Glossary of owarai terms#boke|boke]]'' of the pair, constantly making off the wall comments. His music symbol is the left repeat sign and he represents the number one hundred.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yukito Orikasa|\u6298\u7b20 \u5343\u6597|Orikasa Yukito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]<ref name=\"cast\" />}}\nMostly known by his stage name of {{nihongo|Yuki|\u5343}}, he is the cool and collected member of Re:vale as well as their songwriter. He is shown to have a blunt personality that causes others to believe that he does not care. This is untrue as he is actually quite easygoing and looks after the younger groups very well. He is shown to give a lot of advice to others and many others go to him for advice. Yuki is the ''[[Glossary of owarai terms#tsukkomi|tsukkomi]]'' of the pair, and follows through with pointing out the idiocy Momo currently has on display.

In contrast, Iori Izumi was given long sleeves because of his cool personality. Tanemura had initially drawn Iori and Mitsuki with the same hair color due to them being siblings, but a representative from Bandai Namco Entertainment had allowed her to make an exception.<ref

The deployment followed the [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]] between India and Sri Lanka of 1987 which was intended to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] between [[militant]] [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists]], principally the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), and the [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan military]].\n\nThe original intention was the Indian Peace Keeping Force would not be involved in large scale military operations. However, after a few months, the Indian Peace Keeping Force engaged the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in a series of battles. During the two years in which it was deployed, the IPKF fought numerous battles against the LTTE. The IPKF began withdrawing in 1989, and completed the withdrawal in 1990.\n\n==Background==\n\nAccording to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]], a scholar of [[Indian foreign policy]], [[India]]n intervention in Sri Lankan civil war became inevitable as that civil war threatened India\u2019s \u201cunity, national interest and territorial integrity.\u201d <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul|title=Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s Diplomacy: Historic Significance and Contemporary  Relevance|journal=Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Diplomatist|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=9|page=47|url=http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|accessdate=8 March 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221161446/http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|archive-date=21 February 2018|df=}}</ref> According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar|Laskar]], this threat came in two ways: On the one hand external powers could take advantage of the situation to establish their [[Military base|base]] in [[Sri Lanka]] thus posing a threat to [[India]], and on the other, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]]\u2019s dream of a sovereign [[Tamil Eelam]] comprising all the [[Tamil People|Tamil]] inhabited areas (of Sri Lanka and India) posed a threat to [[India]]\u2019s territorial integrity.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n\n\nAlthough Sri Lanka was a key member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in its initial stages, the Government of Sri Lanka's policies became pro-western as [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J.

Under this accord, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including a [[devolution]] of power to the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|provinces]], a merger\u2014subject to later referendum\u2014of the Northern and the Eastern provinces into the [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|single province]], and official status for the Tamil language (this was enacted as the [[13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka]]). India agreed to establish order in the North and East through a force dubbed the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and to cease assisting Tamil insurgents. Militant groups including the LTTE, although initially reluctant, agreed to surrender their arms to the IPKF, which initially oversaw a cease-fire and a modest [[disarmament]] of the militant groups.\n\nThe signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord, so soon after JR Jayawardene's declaration that he would fight the Indians to the last bullet, led to unrest in south. The arrival of the IPKF to take over control of most areas in the North of the country enabled the Sri Lanka government to shift its forces to the south (in Indian aircraft) to quell the protests. This led to an [[Insurrection 1987-89|uprising]] by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] in the south, which was put down bloodily over the next two years.\n\n==Conflict with the LTTE==\nWhile most Tamil militant groups laid down their weapons and agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters.<ref name=\"cp1\">{{cite news | url =http://www.chinapost.com.tw/latestnews/20061228/43353.htm| title =Tamil rebels abduct 2 rivals, Sri Lankan military says| work =|agency = Associated Press|date = 12 December 2006}}</ref> Keen to ensure the success of the accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three-year-long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses of human rights by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media. The IPKF also soon met stiff opposition from the Tamils.<ref>Balasingham, Adele. (2003) ''The Will to Freedom - An Inside View of Tamil Resistance''.

In brutal fighting that took about three weeks, the IPKF wrested control of the [[Jaffna]] Peninsula from LTTE rule, something that the Sri Lankan army had then tried and failed to achieve for several years. Supported by Indian Army tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE. The IPKF lost around 214 soldiers in this operation.<ref name=BS>[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Army/History/1987/Chapter03.html Operation Pawan.

Mounted on the midnight of 12 October 1987, the operation was planned as a fast heliborne assault involving [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8s]] of the [[No.109 Helicopter Unit|No.109 HU]], the [[Para Commandos (India)|10th Para Commandos]] and a contingent of the [[Sikh Light Infantry|13th Sikh LI]]. The aim of the operation was to capture the [[LTTE]] leadership at [[Jaffna University]] building which served as the [[Military tactics|Tactical]] [[Headquarters]] of the LTTE, which was expected to shorten Operation Pawan, the battle for Jaffna. However, the operation ended disastrously, failing to capture its objectives -owing to intelligence and planning failures. The helidropped force suffered significant casualties, with nearly the entire Sikh LI detachment of twenty nine troops falling to the heavy fortifications of the university and fighting until death, along with six Paracommandos falling in battle.\n\n==End of Indian involvement==\nNationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and they allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a ceasefire. But the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent hostilities. In April 1989, the [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] government ordered the [[Sri Lanka Army]] to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy Tamil National Army (TNA).<ref name=\"atimesd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH31Df01.html|work=Asia Times|title=Chapter 55: Assassination of Athulathmudali|accessdate=28 July 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110604003049/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH31Df01.html|archive-date=4 June 2011|df=}}</ref><ref>Dissanayaka, T.D.S.A.: \"War or Peace in Sri Lanka, Volume II\", p. 332.

The deployment followed the [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]] between India and Sri Lanka of 1987 which was intended to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] between [[militant]] [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists]], principally the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE), and the [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan military]].\n\nThe original intention was the Indian Peace Keeping Force would not be involved in large scale military operations. However, after a few months, the Indian Peace Keeping Force engaged the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in a series of battles. During the two years in which it was deployed, the IPKF fought numerous battles against the LTTE. The IPKF began withdrawing in 1989, and completed the withdrawal in 1990.\n\n==Background==\n\nAccording to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]], a scholar of [[Indian foreign policy]], [[India]]n intervention in Sri Lankan civil war became inevitable as that civil war threatened India\u2019s \u201cunity, national interest and territorial integrity.\u201d <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul|title=Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s Diplomacy: Historic Significance and Contemporary  Relevance|journal=Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Diplomatist|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=9|page=47|url=http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|accessdate=8 March 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221161446/http://www.diplomatist.com/dipom09y2014/article015.html|archive-date=21 February 2018|df=}}</ref> According to [[Rejaul Karim Laskar|Laskar]], this threat came in two ways: On the one hand external powers could take advantage of the situation to establish their [[Military base|base]] in [[Sri Lanka]] thus posing a threat to [[India]], and on the other, the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|LTTE]]\u2019s dream of a sovereign [[Tamil Eelam]] comprising all the [[Tamil People|Tamil]] inhabited areas (of Sri Lanka and India) posed a threat to [[India]]\u2019s territorial integrity.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe LTTE and other Tamil militant groups developed strong relationships with political parties in South India, such as [[Tanittamil Iyakkam|Pure Tamil Movement]] (led by [[Perunchithiranar (Tamil nationalist)|Perunchithiranar]]), [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] (led by [[K.

Under this accord, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, including a [[devolution]] of power to the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|provinces]], a merger\u2014subject to later referendum\u2014of the Northern and the Eastern provinces into the [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|single province]], and official status for the Tamil language (this was enacted as the [[13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka]]). India agreed to establish order in the North and East through a force dubbed the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and to cease assisting Tamil insurgents. Militant groups including the LTTE, although initially reluctant, agreed to surrender their arms to the IPKF, which initially oversaw a cease-fire and a modest [[disarmament]] of the militant groups.\n\nThe signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord, so soon after JR Jayawardene's declaration that he would fight the Indians to the last bullet, led to unrest in south. The arrival of the IPKF to take over control of most areas in the North of the country enabled the Sri Lanka government to shift its forces to the south (in Indian aircraft) to quell the protests. This led to an [[Insurrection 1987-89|uprising]] by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] in the south, which was put down bloodily over the next two years.\n\n==Conflict with the LTTE==\nWhile most Tamil militant groups laid down their weapons and agreed to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict, the LTTE refused to disarm its fighters.<ref name=\"cp1\">{{cite news | url =http://www.chinapost.com.tw/latestnews/20061228/43353.htm| title =Tamil rebels abduct 2 rivals, Sri Lankan military says| work =|agency = Associated Press|date = 12 December 2006}}</ref> Keen to ensure the success of the accord, the IPKF then tried to demobilize the LTTE by force and ended up in full-scale conflict with them. The three-year-long conflict was also marked by the IPKF being accused of committing various abuses of human rights by many human rights groups as well as some within the Indian media.

In brutal fighting that took about three weeks, the IPKF wrested control of the [[Jaffna]] Peninsula from LTTE rule, something that the Sri Lankan army had then tried and failed to achieve for several years. Supported by Indian Army tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE.

Mounted on the midnight of 12 October 1987, the operation was planned as a fast heliborne assault involving [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8s]] of the [[No.109 Helicopter Unit|No.109 HU]], the [[Para Commandos (India)|10th Para Commandos]] and a contingent of the [[Sikh Light Infantry|13th Sikh LI]]. The aim of the operation was to capture the [[LTTE]] leadership at [[Jaffna University]] building which served as the [[Military tactics|Tactical]] [[Headquarters]] of the LTTE, which was expected to shorten Operation Pawan, the battle for Jaffna. However, the operation ended disastrously, failing to capture its objectives -owing to intelligence and planning failures. The helidropped force suffered significant casualties, with nearly the entire Sikh LI detachment of twenty nine troops falling to the heavy fortifications of the university and fighting until death, along with six Paracommandos falling in battle.\n\n==End of Indian involvement==\nNationalist sentiment led many Sinhalese to oppose the continued Indian presence in Sri Lanka. These led to the Sri Lankan government's call for India to quit the island, and they allegedly entered into a secret deal with the LTTE that culminated in a ceasefire. But the LTTE and IPKF continued to have frequent hostilities. In April 1989, the [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] government ordered the [[Sri Lanka Army]] to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy Tamil National Army (TNA).<ref name=\"atimesd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH31Df01.html|work=Asia Times|title=Chapter 55: Assassination of Athulathmudali|accessdate=28 July 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110604003049/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH31Df01.html|archive-date=4 June 2011|df=}}</ref><ref>Dissanayaka, T.D.S.A.: \"War or Peace in Sri Lanka, Volume II\", p. 332.
