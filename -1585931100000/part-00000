It is still able to be viewed on websites, although it is not available in dvd.\n\n==Plot==\nAnne Shirley takes up a teaching position in a town where she finds herself unaccountably in conflict with the founding family and its sour matriarch.\n\nThe movie opens with Gilbert and Anne on a train as she travels to Pringleton. They mention that she has taken the job as  vice principal and in a year she will come back and marry Gilbert.\n\nWhen she arrives at Pringleton, she meets Mrs. Stephen Pringle who tells her she can't board with her as expected. Leaving Anne to fend for herself at the train station, Anne takes a carriage to Windy Poplars, which reminds her of Green Gables. Her hosts at Windy Poplars tell Anne that Hester Pringle, who owns the house across the way, is a bitter old woman- and is also the one who is blackballing her in town.\n\nJabez, a workman at the school, gives her a heads up that Hester is adamant that she will make Anne give up her job. The principal, Mr. Gibson overloads Anne with work in addition to teaching and berates her when Jen Pringle's father complain about her. Anne and Jabez begin to listen to conversations through the air vents and find that Jen plans to be nasty to Anne, knowing her father will weld his power over Anne.\n\nAnne goes to her classroom and finds a caricature of her on the board. She compliments Jen on her \"drawing\" and when asked how she know she did it, answers \"I'm psychic.\" and allows her to decorate the boards for Halloween. She expounds by saying she knows from this day on she won't have to punish her and bids everyone to have happy thoughts.\n\nAnne has a conversation with Betty, a little orphan girl, longing for her parents to come home and take her from her aunt Ernestine Pringle. She makes the comment that she can't wait until tomorrow so hopefull her parents come but her aunt tells her tomorrow never arrives. This saddens Anne and she writes home, missing Gilbert. She talks with Catherine Pringle who says Anne hates everyone Pringle. Back at Windy Poplars, Matey gives Anne a diary that gives her ammunition to start a conversation with Hester Pringle. Anne and Hester talk about them. Hester is her haughty self and Anne says she pities the family insomuch that their ancestor was a nasty piece of work and they are all bitter. Hester is astounded when Anne leaves the diaries with her, remarking they were the one thing that would have let her win.\n\nAnne rushes out and meets Tony Pringle, who is drunk, near the cemetery. He confides he is miserable and knows she is too. He said that Catherine must hate her because the dramatic society was taken from her upon Anne's arrival. They part ways, with him calling her Annie and asking her why she doesn't give up and realizing she isn't a quitter.\n\nAnne approaches Catherine about a play she wrote based on Cinderella and promised her full control. Catherine declines at first and then says she would think about it. Anne primes Jen to play the lead. Preparations ensue.\n\nGilbert shows up with presents and Anne is happy. Anne goes to get Betty to take her to the play and she finds the girl sick and her family unwilling to help her. Anne puts her to bed and promises to visit the next day.\n\nTony Pringle shows up looking for Anne. Catherine tells him to leave. Tony says there won't be a play and says that Jen is sick. Anne shows up and they try to shield her from the truth. Catherine goes to Hester's home. The doctor is treating Hester and Catherine sneaks upstairs with the blessing of the doctor and sneaks Jen out of the house. The show goes on with Jabez reading lines through the air vents. The play is a great success.\n\nAnne rushes over to see Betty during the show with Gilbert. Betty is very sick so Anne acts out the play for her though crying most of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Hester climbs the stairs and finds Catherine in Jen's place. She locks Catherine in the room. As Hester leaves, she has an attack and falls down the stairs.\n\nGilbert and Anne discuss Betty, who seems to have improved. They meet Tony on the road and they tell her that Catherine never made it back. In the distance, they see Hester's home, Maplehurst, burning. Tony said Jen told him Catherine was locked in her room. They hurry to the house.\n\nThe folks at Windy Poplars see Maplehurt burning and hurry over. Catherine is pulled from the building. Jen is safe.

Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate, but they don't believe her and walk away disgusted.\n\nThat night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on [[Mulholland Drive]] by his 24-year-old sister Ellie, who has just returned from visiting her boyfriend, Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke. Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky Morton, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half.  When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar.\n\nThe next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood. But she dismisses it.\n\nAt a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Soon after this Jenny heads down to the parking garage where she is chased and killed by a werewolf. Zela's predictions for both Jenny and Becky have come to pass.\n\nJimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a [[werewolf]], sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy's concerns she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned.\n\nJimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling team]]. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is [[Closeted|repressing his own homosexuality]].\n\nEllie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela, who warns about the effect the coming full moon will have. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel. Their dog, Zipper,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.miramax.com/watch?v=d2Z2JvYToLgd13EOTXqHPtOBwBwbJFXv |author= [[Miramax]] |date= 2005 |title= ''Cursed'' - Bad Dog |publisher= Miramax |quote= Jimmy's dog Zipper develops a condition no veteranarian can cure. |accessdate= December 14, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094727/http://www.miramax.com/watch?v=d2Z2JvYToLgd13EOTXqHPtOBwBwbJFXv |archive-date= December 22, 2015 |url-status= dead }}</ref> bites Jimmy, tastes his blood, becomes a lycanthropoid monster, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy.\n\nEllie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf. He confirms it, but claims it wasn't he who attacked her and Jimmy. When a fourth werewolf attacks them, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The new werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a [[one-night stand]] with Jake. She now wants revenge by killing all of the other girls Jake dates. When Jake refuses to let Joanie hurt Ellie, she knocks him out, then turns into werewolf form and starts attacking. Ellie and Jimmy fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire, apparently killing her in werewolf form, but she rises again as her head and heart are still connected. A policeman shoots her in the head, finally killing her. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared.\n\nJimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jake arrives. He reveals that since Joanie's curse was caused by him, the only way to cure it is to kill the werewolf who started the curse-line and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her werewolf form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body [[Spontaneous combustion|bursts into flames]].\n\nBo, Brooke, and Zipper arrive at the house. Bo and Jimmy are now friends; Jimmy kisses Brooke and walks her home along with Bo. Ellie is stuck with the clean-up of the messy house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Ellie Myers\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jimmy Myers\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Joanie\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Bo\n* [[Kristina Anapau]] as Brooke\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Zela\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Becky Morton\n* [[M\u00fda]] as Jenny Tate\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Kyle\n* [[Eric Ladin]] as Louie\n* [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Nosebleed Co-Worker\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Police Officer\n* [[Derek Mears]] as Werewolf\n* [[Scott Baio]] as himself\n* [[Craig Kilborn]] as himself\n* [[Lance Bass]] as himself\n* [[Bowling for Soup]] as themselves\n* Solar as Zipper, Ellie and Jimmy's dog\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe original script was written in August 2000. Dimension co-founder [[Bob Weinstein]] announced in October 2002 that ''Cursed'' would \"reinvent the werewolf genre,\" and [[Wes Craven]] would direct, with the movie being released around August 2003.\n\nChristina Ricci, [[Skeet Ulrich]], and Jesse Eisenberg were cast as the three leads. The original plotline had three strangers brought together by a car accident in the Hollywood Hills and the subsequent attack of a werewolf. The three characters were named Ellie Hudson, Vince Winston, and Jimmy Myers. With a budget of $38 million, ''Cursed'' commenced shooting in March 2003 in Los Angeles. The set used for the high school is [[Torrance High School]], the same used for [[Sunnydale High]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and West Beverly High on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and its spin-off ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]''. Filming also occurred at [[Verdugo Hills High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/j4fun/location/films.html|title=VHHS On Location! Feature Films|website=Lausd.k12.ca.us|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> Special effects were shot in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nHowever, the film soon suffered numerous production and script issues and was postponed for over a year. While production was stalled, several cast members had to be replaced due to scheduling conflicts with other films. When the movie was rewritten and reshot, many cast members had been cut entirely, including [[Skeet Ulrich]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Omar Epps]], [[Illeana Douglas]], [[Heather Langenkamp]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Robert Forster]], and [[Corey Feldman]]. Some of them had even filmed scenes which were scrapped by director [[Wes Craven]]. In the film, Ellie works among the crew of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'', with Kilborn making a [[cameo appearance]] and [[Scott Baio]], as himself, being booked to appear on the show. But by the time the film was released in February 2005, Kilborn had left the show and had been replaced with [[Craig Ferguson]].\n\nOnly about 90% of the original version was filmed, leaving the original scripted version unfilmed. Although, while filming the original version, producer Bob Weinstein told Wes Craven he was happy with the film, he later changed his opinion and ordered for the movie to be reshot with a new plot. After massive reshoots which included filming a new ending, Weinstein told Craven he didn't like the new ending, leading to another ending where Jake attacks Ellie and Jimmy in their home, despite some incoherence with the rest of the film.<ref name=\"craveonline.com\"/>\n\nRick Baker did the werewolf effects for the original version of the film, but once Bob Weinstein and Miramax ordered reshoots, all the scenes with Baker's effects were deleted and replaced by KNB.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Dimension cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Wes Craven commented, \"The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions.

Zela foretells that they will suffer a horrible fate, but they don't believe her and walk away disgusted.\n\nThat night, 16-year-old high-schooler Jimmy Myers is picked up on [[Mulholland Drive]] by his 24-year-old sister Ellie, who has just returned from visiting her boyfriend, Jake Taylor. Jimmy had a run-in with some bullies and his crush, Brooke. Driving home, Jimmy and Ellie collide with an animal and another car. They attempt to rescue the other driver, Becky Morton, but an unseen creature slashes the siblings before it drags Becky off and rips her in half.  When interviewed by police, despite Jimmy's belief that it was a wolf or dog-type animal, the official report credits it to a bear or cougar.\n\nThe next day at work, Ellie finds herself attracted to the scent of a coworkers blood. But she dismisses it.\n\nAt a party, Jenny interrupts a conversation between Ellie and Jake. Annoyed that Jenny is flirting with Jake, Ellie leaves the party early. Soon after this Jenny heads down to the parking garage where she is chased and killed by a werewolf. Zela's predictions for both Jenny and Becky have come to pass.\n\nJimmy does research about wolves in California and starts to believe that the creature was a [[werewolf]], sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. To ease Jimmy's concerns she touches a silver picture frame without getting burned.\n\nJimmy is becoming much stronger and more aggressive, as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestling team]]. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is [[Closeted|repressing his own homosexuality]].\n\nEllie starts to believe the werewolf hypothesis when she meets Zela, who warns about the effect the coming full moon will have. Jimmy proves they have been cursed when he holds a silver cake server and gets burned, discovering that the picture frame Ellie touched earlier was only stainless steel. Their dog, Zipper,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.miramax.com/watch?v=d2Z2JvYToLgd13EOTXqHPtOBwBwbJFXv |author= [[Miramax]] |date= 2005 |title= ''Cursed'' - Bad Dog |publisher= Miramax |quote= Jimmy's dog Zipper develops a condition no veteranarian can cure. |accessdate= December 14, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222094727/http://www.miramax.com/watch?v=d2Z2JvYToLgd13EOTXqHPtOBwBwbJFXv |archive-date= December 22, 2015 |url-status= dead }}</ref> bites Jimmy, tastes his blood, becomes a lycanthropoid monster, and goes on a rampage. Realizing what's happening, Jimmy goes to warn Ellie with Bo, who showed up at their house to confess that he is gay and has feelings for Jimmy; Bo is flatly rejected by Jimmy who believes the attraction to be his werewolf pheromones, but Bo still helps Jimmy.\n\nEllie has deduced that Jake is a werewolf. He confirms it, but claims it wasn't he who attacked her and Jimmy. When a fourth werewolf attacks them, Bo and Jimmy try to help, but Bo is knocked out. The new werewolf turns back into Joanie, who was cursed after a [[one-night stand]] with Jake. She now wants revenge by killing all of the other girls Jake dates. When Jake refuses to let Joanie hurt Ellie, she knocks him out, then turns into werewolf form and starts attacking. Ellie and Jimmy fight her, and when the police arrive, the two draw her out by insulting her. The police open fire, apparently killing her in werewolf form, but she rises again as her head and heart are still connected. A policeman shoots her in the head, finally killing her. Bo is okay, but Jake has disappeared.\n\nJimmy and Ellie return to a wrecked home. As Jimmy works to restore the power, Jake arrives. He reveals that since Joanie\u2019s curse was caused by him, the only way to cure it is to kill the werewolf who started the curse-line and wants to kill Jimmy (due to his alpha male instinct) and have Ellie live forever by his side. She and Jake fight, but her werewolf form emerges sporadically while he has complete control over his, dominating the fight. Werewolf Jimmy joins in, climbing across the ceiling and biting Jake, allowing Ellie to stab and badly injure Jake with the silver cake server. Ellie decapitates Jake with a shovel and breaks the curse on the two siblings (and Zipper). They watch as Jake's body [[Spontaneous combustion|bursts into flames]].\n\nBo, Brooke, and Zipper arrive at the house. Bo and Jimmy are now friends; Jimmy kisses Brooke and walks her home along with Bo. Ellie is stuck with the clean-up of the messy house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Ellie Myers\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jimmy Myers\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Joanie\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Bo\n* [[Kristina Anapau]] as Brooke\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as Zela\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Becky Morton\n* [[M\u00fda]] as Jenny Tate\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Kyle\n* [[Eric Ladin]] as Louie\n* [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Nosebleed Co-Worker\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Police Officer\n* [[Derek Mears]] as Werewolf\n* [[Scott Baio]] as himself\n* [[Craig Kilborn]] as himself\n* [[Lance Bass]] as himself\n* [[Bowling for Soup]] as themselves\n* Solar as Zipper, Ellie and Jimmy's dog\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe original script was written in August 2000. Dimension co-founder [[Bob Weinstein]] announced in October 2002 that ''Cursed'' would \"reinvent the werewolf genre,\" and [[Wes Craven]] would direct, with the movie being released around August 2003.\n\nChristina Ricci, [[Skeet Ulrich]], and Jesse Eisenberg were cast as the three leads. The original plotline had three strangers brought together by a car accident in the Hollywood Hills and the subsequent attack of a werewolf. The three characters were named Ellie Hudson, Vince Winston, and Jimmy Myers. With a budget of $38 million, ''Cursed'' commenced shooting in March 2003 in Los Angeles. The set used for the high school is [[Torrance High School]], the same used for [[Sunnydale High]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and West Beverly High on ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and its spin-off ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]''. Filming also occurred at [[Verdugo Hills High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lausd.k12.ca.us/Verdugo_HS/j4fun/location/films.html|title=VHHS On Location! Feature Films|website=Lausd.k12.ca.us|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref> Special effects were shot in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nHowever, the film soon suffered numerous production and script issues and was postponed for over a year. While production was stalled, several cast members had to be replaced due to scheduling conflicts with other films. When the movie was rewritten and reshot, many cast members had been cut entirely, including [[Skeet Ulrich]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Omar Epps]], [[Illeana Douglas]], [[Heather Langenkamp]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Robert Forster]], and [[Corey Feldman]]. Some of them had even filmed scenes which were scrapped by director [[Wes Craven]]. In the film, Ellie works among the crew of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'', with Kilborn making a [[cameo appearance]] and [[Scott Baio]], as himself, being booked to appear on the show. But by the time the film was released in February 2005, Kilborn had left the show and had been replaced with [[Craig Ferguson]].\n\nOnly about 90% of the original version was filmed, leaving the original scripted version unfilmed. Although, while filming the original version, producer Bob Weinstein told Wes Craven he was happy with the film, he later changed his opinion and ordered for the movie to be reshot with a new plot. After massive reshoots which included filming a new ending, Weinstein told Craven he didn't like the new ending, leading to another ending where Jake attacks Ellie and Jimmy in their home, despite some incoherence with the rest of the film.<ref name=\"craveonline.com\"/>\n\nRick Baker did the werewolf effects for the original version of the film, but once Bob Weinstein and Miramax ordered reshoots, all the scenes with Baker's effects were deleted and replaced by KNB.<ref name=\"bloody-disgusting.com\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Dimension cut the film to a PG-13 rating instead of the planned R rating. Speaking to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Wes Craven commented, \"The contract called for us to make an R-rated film. We did. It was a very difficult process. Then it was basically taken away from us and cut to PG-13 and ruined. It was two years of very difficult work and almost 100 days of shooting of various versions. Then at the very end, it was chopped up and the studio thought they could make more with a PG-13 movie, and trashed it ... I thought it was completely disrespectful, and it hurt them too, and it was like they shot themselves in the foot with a shotgun.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/>\n\nJenny's death scene in the elevator was originally much gorier, her dead body shown with her belly ripped apart, but not even the R-rated DVD version included this scene. A picture of her mutilated body was, however, shown in a ''Fangoria'' article published before the film's release covering the infamously troubled production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smg.photobucket.com/user/marcobeltrami/media/scream/cursedmya.jpg.html|title=Photo by marcobeltrami|website=Photobucket|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Wes Craven was quoted saying; \"... the ''Cursed'' experience was so screwed up. I mean, that went on for two-and-a-half years of my life for a film that wasn't anything close to what it should have been. And another film that I was about to shoot having the plug pulled \u2013 ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'' \u2013 so it was like, I did learn from the ''Cursed'' experience not to do something for money. They said, 'We know you want to do another film, we'll pay you double.' And we were 10 days from shooting, and I said fine. But I ended up working two-and-a-half years for double my fee, but I could have done two-and-a-half movies, and done movies that were out there making money. In general, I think it's not worth it and part of the reason my phone hasn't rung is that that story is pretty well known.\"<ref name=\"thisdistractedglobe.com\"/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2014, costar [[Judy Greer]] spoke of the film in an interview: \"I don't know why that movie got so fucked up.

{"title_page": "Leak", "text_new": "{{short description|Method of fluid escaping containment}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}\n\nA '''leak''' is a way (usually an opening) for [[fluid]] to escape a container or [[fluid]]-containing system, such as a [[Water tank|tank]] or a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], through which the contents of the container can escape or outside matter can enter the container. Leaks are usually unintended and therefore undesired. The word ''leak'' usually refers to a gradual loss; a sudden loss is usually called a ''spill''.\n\nThe matter leaking in or out can be [[gas]], [[liquid]], a highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] paste, or even a [[solid]] such as a [[Powder (substance)|powdered]] or granular solid or other solid particles.\n\nSometimes the word \"''leak''\" is used in a figurative sense. For example, in a [[news leak]] secret information becomes public.\n\nAccording to ASTM D7053-17, water leakage is the passage of (liquid) water through a material or system designed to prevent passage of water.\n\n==Types and possible causes==\n\n[[File:U.S. Sailors with the Executive Leadership Development Program battle leaks in the damage control wet trainer during a tour of Submarine Learning Center Detachment San Diego Jan. 13, 2014 140113-N-RC734-134.jpg|thumb|Water leakage]]\n\nTypes of leak openings include a puncture, gash, [[rust]] or other [[corrosion]] hole, very tiny ''pinhole leak'' (possibly in imperfect [[Welding|welds]]), crack or microcrack, or inadequate sealing between components or parts joined together.  When there is a puncture, the size and shape of the leak can often be seen, but in many other cases, the size and shape of the leak opening may not be so obvious. In many cases, the location of a leak can be determined by seeing material drip out at a certain place, although the leak opening itself is not obvious.  In some cases, it may be known or suspected there is a leak, but even the location of the leak is not known.  Since leak openings are often so irregular, leaks are sometimes sized by the leakage rate, as in volume of fluid leaked per time, rather than the size of the opening.\n\nCommon types of leaks for many people include leaks in [[vehicle]] [[tire]]s, causing air to leak out resulting in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents.  Leaks can occur or develop in many different kinds of household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid.  Leaks in vehicle [[hydraulic]] systems such as [[brake]]  or [[power steering]] lines could cause outleakage of brake or power steering fluid resulting in failure of the brakes, power steering, or other hydraulic system. Also possible are leaks of engine coolant - particularly in the [[radiator]] and at the [[water pump]] seal, [[transmission fluid]], [[motor oil]], and [[refrigerant]] in the [[air conditioning]] system.  Some of these vehicle fluids have different colors to help identify the type of leaking fluid. A [[zinc-carbon battery]] is an example of an easy-leaking system; the [[electrolyte]]s inside the cell sometimes leak out of the cell casing and cause damage to an electronic appliance.<ref>Cheng, E. et al., ''Chemistry - A Modern View 2'', Aristo-Wilson, Hong Kong, 2004</ref>\n\nThe [[water supply system]] or a [[wastewater]] system in a house or other building may have a leak in any of numerous locations, causing dripping out or spillage of the water. [[Gas leak]]s, e.g. in [[natural gas]] lines allow [[flammable]] and potentially [[explosive]] gas to leak out, resulting in a hazardous situation.  Leaks of refrigerant may occur in [[refrigerator]]s or air conditioning systems, large and small.  Some industrial plants, especially [[chemical plant|chemical]] and [[power plant]]s, have numerous fluid systems containing many types of liquid or gas chemicals, sometimes at high [[temperature]] and/or [[pressure]].  An example of a possible industrial location of a leak between two fluid systems includes a leak between the shell and tube sides in a [[heat exchanger]], potentially contaminating either or both fluid systems with the other fluid.  A system holding a full or partial [[vacuum]] may have a leak causing inleakage of air from the outside.  Hazmat procedures and/or teams may become involved when leakage or spillage of hazardous materials occurs.  Leaks while transporting hazardous materials could result in danger; for example, when accidents occur.  However, even leakage of [[steam]] can be dangerous because of the high temperature and energy of the steam.\n\nLeakage of air or other gas out of [[hot air balloon]]s, [[dirigible]]s, or cabins of [[airplane]]s could present dangerous situations.  A leak could even be inside a body, such as a hole in the [[septum]] between [[heart]] ventricles causing an exchange of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, or a [[fistula]] between bodily cavities such as between [[vagina]] and [[rectum]].\n\nThere can be numerous causes of leaks.  Leaks can occur from the outset even during [[construction]] or initial manufacture/assembly of fluid systems.  [[Pipe (material)|Pipes]], [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tubing]], [[valve]]s, [[Pipe and plumbing fitting|fittings]], or other components may be improperly joined or welded together.  Components with threads may be improperly screwed together.  Leaks can be caused by damage; for example, punctures or fracture.  Often leaks are the result of deterioration of materials from wear or aging, such as rusting or other corrosion or decomposition of [[elastomer]]s or similar [[polymer]] materials used as [[gasket]]s or other [[Seal (mechanical)|seals]].  For example, wearing out of [[faucet]] [[washer (hardware)|washers]] causes water to leak at the faucets.  Cracks may result from either outright damage, or wearing out by stress such as [[fatigue (material)|fatigue failure]] or corrosion such as [[stress corrosion cracking]].  Wearing out of a surface between a disk and its seat in a valve could cause a leak between ports (valve inlets or outlets).  Wearing out of packing around a turning valve stem or rotating [[centrifugal pump]] shaft could develop into fluid outleakage into the environment.  For some frequently operating centrifugal pumps, such leakage is so expected that provisions are made for carrying away the leakage.  Similarly, wearing out of seals or packing around piston-driven pumps could also develop into outleakage to the environment.\n\nThe pressure difference between both sides of the leak can affect the movement of material through the leak.  Fluids will commonly move from the higher pressure side to the lower pressure side.  The larger the pressure difference, the more leakage there will typically be.  The fluid pressures on both sides include the [[hydrostatic pressure]], which is pressure due to the [[weight]] from the height of fluid level above the leak.  When the pressures are about equal, there can be an exchange of fluids between both sides, or little to no net movement of fluid across the leak.\n\n==Testing==\n{{main|Leak detection}}\n[[File:Acoustic leak detector.webm|thumb|A technician uses an acoustic leak detector (sound amplifier) to identify the pipeline leak location]]\nContainers, vessels, enclosures, or other fluid system are sometimes tested for leaks - to see if there is any leakage and to find where the leaks are so corrective action can be taken.  There are several methods for [[Leak detection|leak testing]], depending on the situation.  Sometimes leakage of fluid may make a [[sound]] which can be detected.  Tires, engine radiators, and maybe some other smaller vessels may be tested by pressurizing them with air and submerging them in water to see where air [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] come out to indicate a leak.  If submerging in water is not possible, then pressurization with air followed by covering the area to be tested with a [[soap]] solution is done to see if soap bubbles form, which indicate a leak.  Other types of testing for gas leaks may involve testing for the outleaking gases with sensors which can detect that gas, for example - special sensing instruments for detecting natural gas.  U.S. federal safety law now requires natural gas companies to conduct testing for gas leaks upstream of their customer's gas meters.  Where liquids are used, special color dyes may be added to help see the leakage.  Other detectable substances in one of the liquids may be tested, such as saline to find a leak in a sea water system, or detectable substances may even be deliberately added to test for leakage.\n\nNewly constructed, fabricated, or repaired systems or other vessels are sometimes tested to verify satisfactory production or repair.  [[Plumber]]s often test for leaks after working on a water or other fluid system.  A vessel or system is sometimes pressure tested by filling with air and the pressure monitored to see if it drops, indicating a leak. \nA very commonly used test after new construction or repair is a [[hydrostatic test]],  sometimes called a pressure test.  In a hydrostatic test, a system is pressurized with water to look for a drop in pressure or to see where it leaks out.  [[Helium]] testing may be done to detect for any very small leakage such as when testing certain diaphragm or bellows valves, made for high purity and utra high purity service, requiring low leak rate capability.  [[Helium]] and [[hydrogen]] have very small [[molecule]]s which can go through very small leaks.\n\nLeak testing is part of the non-destructive test [[nondestructive testing|NDT]] portfolio that can be applied to a part to verify its conformity; depending on material, pressure, leak tightness specifications, different methods can be applied. International standards has been defined to assist in these choices. For example, BS EN 1779:1999; it applies to assessment of leak tightness by indication or measurement of gas leakage, but excludes hydrostatic, ultrasonic or electromagnetic methods.\nOther standards also apply:\n* BS EN 13184:2001 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Pressure change process\n* BS EN 13185:2001 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. [[Tracer gas]] method\n* BS EN 13192:2002 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Calibration of reference leaks for gases\n\nIn [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s, [[Eddy current]] testing is sometimes done in the tubes to find locations on tubes where there may be leaks or damage which may eventually develop into a leak.\n\n==Corrective action==\n\nIn complex plants with multiple fluid systems, many interconnecting units holding fluids have isolation valves between them.  If there is a leak in a unit, its isolation valves can be shut to \"isolate\" the unit from the rest of the plant.\n\nLeaks are often repaired by plugging the leaking holes or using a patch to cover them.  Leaking tires are often fixed this way.  Leaking gaskets, seals, washers, or packing can be replaced.  Use of welding, soldering, sealing, or gluing may be other ways to fix leaks.  Sometimes, the most practical solution is to replace the leaking unit. Leaking [[water heating|water heaters]] are often replaced by home or building owners.\n\nIf there is a leak in one of the tubes of a [[shell and tube heat exchanger]], that tube can be plugged at both ends with specially sized plugs to isolate the leak.  This is done in the plenum(s) at the points where the tube ends connect to the tubesheet(s).  Sometimes a damaged but not yet leaking tube is pre-emptively plugged to prevent future leakage.  The [[heat transfer]] capacity of that tube is lost, but there are usually plenty of other tubes to pick up the heat transfer load.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|leak}}\n* [[Explosion]]\n* [[Fugitive emissions]]\n* [[Non-revenue water]]\n* [[Seal (mechanical)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Plumbing]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Method of fluid escaping containment}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}\n\nA '''leak''' is a way (usually an opening) for [[fluid]] to escape a container or [[fluid]]-containing system, such as a [[Water tank|tank]] or a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], through which the contents of the container can escape or outside matter can enter the container.

U.S. federal safety law now requires natural gas companies to conduct testing for gas leaks upstream of their customer's gas meters.  Where liquids are used, special color dyes may be added to help see the leakage.  Other detectable substances in one of the liquids may be tested, such as saline to find a leak in a sea water system, or detectable substances may even be deliberately added to test for leakage.\n\nNewly constructed, fabricated, or repaired systems or other vessels are sometimes tested to verify satisfactory production or repair.  [[Plumber]]s often test for leaks after working on a water or other fluid system.  A vessel or system is sometimes pressure tested by filling with air and the pressure monitored to see if it drops, indicating a leak. \nA very commonly used test after new construction or repair is a [[hydrostatic test]],  sometimes called a pressure test.  In a hydrostatic test, a system is pressurized with water to look for a drop in pressure or to see where it leaks out.  [[Helium]] testing may be done to detect for any very small leakage such as when testing certain diaphragm or bellows valves, made for high purity and utra high purity service, requiring low leak rate capability.  [[Helium]] and [[hydrogen]] have very small [[molecule]]s which can go through very small leaks.\n\nLeak testing is part of the non-destructive test [[nondestructive testing|NDT]] portfolio that can be applied to a part to verify its conformity; depending on material, pressure, leak tightness specifications, different methods can be applied. International standards has been defined to assist in these choices. For example, BS EN 1779:1999; it applies to assessment of leak tightness by indication or measurement of gas leakage, but excludes hydrostatic, ultrasonic or electromagnetic methods.\nOther standards also apply:\n* BS EN 13184:2001 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Pressure change process\n* BS EN 13185:2001 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. [[Tracer gas]] method\n* BS EN 13192:2002 Non-destructive testing. Leak testing. Calibration of reference leaks for gases\n\nIn [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s, [[Eddy current]] testing is sometimes done in the tubes to find locations on tubes where there may be leaks or damage which may eventually develop into a leak.\n\n==Corrective action==\n\nIn complex plants with multiple fluid systems, many interconnecting units holding fluids have isolation valves between them.  If there is a leak in a unit, its isolation valves can be shut to \"isolate\" the unit from the rest of the plant.\n\nLeaks are often repaired by plugging the leaking holes or using a patch to cover them.  Leaking tires are often fixed this way.  Leaking gaskets, seals, washers, or packing can be replaced.  Use of welding, soldering, sealing, or gluing may be other ways to fix leaks.  Sometimes, the most practical solution is to replace the leaking unit. Leaking [[water heater]]s are often replaced by home or building owners.\n\nIf there is a leak in one of the tubes of a [[shell and tube heat exchanger]], that tube can be plugged at both ends with specially sized plugs to isolate the leak.  This is done in the plenum(s) at the points where the tube ends connect to the tubesheet(s).  Sometimes a damaged but not yet leaking tube is pre-emptively plugged to prevent future leakage.  The [[heat transfer]] capacity of that tube is lost, but there are usually plenty of other tubes to pick up the heat transfer load.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|leak}}\n* [[Explosion]]\n* [[Fugitive emissions]]\n* [[Non-revenue water]]\n* [[Seal (mechanical)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Plumbing]]\n", "name_user": "TheAwesomeHwyh", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:water heater\u2192water heating", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leak"}

Amy is [[Coming out|out]] and has a crush on a girl named Ryan; Molly urges her to pursue a relationship with Ryan before they graduate. On the eve of graduation, Molly confronts classmates talking about her in the bathroom. She tells them she got into Yale, but they reveal that, despite their partying, they too got into prestigious colleges. Furious, Molly tells Amy they should have enjoyed their time in high school more. She proposes they go to a graduation party held by classmate Nick, and Amy reluctantly agrees.\n\nRealizing that neither of them knows the party's address, Molly calls Jared, a wealthy classmate who likes her. He brings them to his party aboard a yacht; only his drug-crazed friend Gigi is there, and she feeds the girls strawberries before jumping off the yacht. Amy suggests they go home, but Molly calls a \"[[Malala Yousafzai|Malala]]\" (their code for unconditionally doing what the other wants to do). The girls call a [[Lyft]] and are shocked to be picked up by their principal, Jordan Brown.\n\nTo prepare Amy for potential sex with Ryan, Molly insists they watch [[pornography]], which accidentally plays through the car speakers. Brown drops them off at what they think is Nick's aunt's house but turns out to be the home of their classmate George, who is hosting a [[Murder mystery game|murder mystery party]]. They encounter Gigi, who reveals that the strawberries were laced with powerful hallucinogenic drugs. Amy and Molly experience a [[bad trip]] and hallucinate that they are George's sister's plastic fashion dolls. They manage to escape George's house, but Gigi reveals that Molly secretly likes Nick.\n\nDespite wanting to go home, Amy insists they press on so Molly can consummate her crush on Nick. The girls head to the library, where they see pizza boxes in an online video of Nick's party and acquire the address from the pizza delivery man. Amy accidentally leaves her phone in his car, and Molly's phone battery lasts just long enough to call their favorite teacher, Miss Fine, who gives them a change of clothes and a ride to Nick's party.\n\nThere, Amy finds Ryan making out with Nick. Heartbroken, she finds Molly and calls her own \"Malala,\u201d which Molly refuses, thinking she still has a chance with Nick. Amy angrily reveals that she is not just spending the summer in [[Botswana]] but taking an entire [[gap year]] there because she resents how Molly always tries to control her life.\n\nThe two friends argue in front of the entire party. Amy runs to the bathroom, finding her classmate Hope already there; they are initially combative until Amy kisses her. Jared appears, and he and Molly have a heartfelt conversation about how no one at school really knows them. Amy and Hope start to have sex, but Amy vomits on her. Cops arrive, and the party-goers scatter. Molly, unable to find Amy, is driven home by \u201cTriple A,\u201d a popular student with a promiscuous reputation, and they bond over the stereotypes they both have endured.\n\nWaking up on graduation day, Molly checks her phone and discovers her classmates praising Amy for creating a diversion at the party, allowing everyone to escape the police while getting herself arrested. Molly visits Amy in jail and apologizes for her manipulative actions, and they reconcile. Learning the pizza delivery man is a serial killer, they trade that information to free Amy, and take Jared's car to graduation. Molly kisses Jared onstage and gives an improvised valedictorian speech, receiving a standing ovation.\n\nA few days later, as Molly helps Amy prepare for her trip to Botswana, Hope visits to give Amy her phone number. Molly drives Amy to the airport, where they share a tearful goodbye. As Molly drives away, Amy jumps in front of her car, saying she has time to hang out before her flight; she suggests they get pancakes, and Molly ecstatically accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cast of Booksmart at SXSW - 32404721467.jpg|thumb|(L:R) [[Noah Galvin]], [[Molly Gordon]], [[Will Forte]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Billie Lourd]], [[Kaitlyn Dever]], and [[Beanie Feldstein]] at the film's [[South by Southwest]] premiere]]\n{{Cast listing|\n<!--- End credit title cards --->\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Molly Davidson\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Amy Antsler\n* [[Jessica Williams (actress)|Jessica Williams]] as Miss Fine\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Charmaine Antsler\n* [[Will Forte]] as Doug Antsler\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Jordan Brown\n* [[Billie Lourd]] as Gigi\n* [[Diana Silvers]] as Hope\n* [[Skyler Gisondo]] as Jared\n* [[Molly Gordon]] as Annabelle, or \"Triple A\"\n* [[Noah Galvin]] as George\n* [[Austin Crute]] as Alan\n* Victoria Ruesga as Ryan\n* Eduardo Franco as Theo\n* Nico Hiraga as Tanner\n* Mason Gooding as Nick Howland\n* [[Mike O'Brien (actor)|Mike O'Brien]] as Pat the Pizza Guy\n<!--- End credits crawl, named or notable only --->\n* Bluesy Burke as Cindy\n* Christopher Avila as Rob\n* [[Stephanie Styles]] as Alison\n* Adam Simon Krist as Dick\n* Gideon Lang as Skip\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Motivational Voice<ref name=\"Thrillist\">{{cite web |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Esther |title=What It's Like Playing Mortal Enemies in 'Booksmart' for Three Real-Life Best Friends |url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/booksmart-movie-beanie-feldstein-molly-gordon-noah-galvin-interview |publisher=[[Thrillist]] |accessdate=May 19, 2019 |date=May 9, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAn early version of the screenplay, ''Book Smart'' by Emily Halpern and [[Sarah Haskins (comedian)|Sarah Haskins]], was circulated in 2009 and appeared on the 2009 [[Black List (survey)|Black List]];<ref name=\"variety-review\" /> in 2014 [[Susanna Fogel]] revised the screenplay, rewriting one lead character as a [[lesbian]] and revising the story so the girls are not seeking boyfriends for the prom, but are going to an after-prom party.<ref name=\"Guerrasi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/booksmart-from-hyped-2009-script-to-a-2019-hit-movie-2019-5 |title=How 'Booksmart' went from a 2009 script collecting dust to this year's must-see movie of the summer |work=[[Business Insider]] |first=Jason |last=Guerrasi |date=May 25, 2019 |accessdate=May 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the revisions, [[Annapurna Pictures]] purchased the screenplay and approached [[Gloria Sanchez Productions]] to produce it; Gloria Sanchez' Jessica Elbaum pitched the screenplay to [[Olivia Wilde]], who read the screenplay and two days later expressed admiration for it.<ref name=\"Guerrasi\"/> [[Megan Ellison]], Chelsea Bernard, David Distenfeld, [[Will Ferrell]], [[Adam McKay]], and Elbaum would serve as producers on the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/olivia-wilde-feature-directing-debut-booksmart/|title=Olivia Wilde to Make Feature Directing Debut With ''Booksmart''|website=[[The Wrap]]|first=Umberto|last=Gonzalez|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Katie Silberman]] was hired for more revisions in spring 2018, and to update the story.<ref name=\"Guerrasi\"/><ref name=\"Erbland\">{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/booksmart-writer-katie-silberman-interview-1202143169/ |title=How 'Booksmart' Writer Katie Silberman Turned a Beloved Years-Old Script Into the Movie of the Moment |website=[[Indiewire]] |first=Kate |last=Erbland |date=May 21, 2019 |accessdate=May 25, 2019}}</ref> Silberman explored a new concept:\n{{quote|What if the two friends realized that they did high school all wrong?

film]] directed by [[Olivia Wilde]] (in her feature [[List of directorial debuts#2019|directorial debut]]), from a screenplay by Emily Halpern, [[Sarah Haskins (comedian)|Sarah Haskins]], [[Susanna

[[Will Ferrell]] and [[Adam McKay]] executive produced the film through [[Gloria Sanchez Productions]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at [[South by Southwest]] on March 10, 2019, and was theatrically released by [[United Artists#United Artists Releasing|United Artists Releasing]] in the United States on May 24, 2019, to acclaim from critics and grossed over $24 million.

Amy is [[Coming out|out]] and has a crush on a girl named Ryan; Molly urges her to pursue a relationship with Ryan before they graduate. On the eve of graduation, Molly confronts classmates talking about her in the bathroom. She tells them she got into Yale, but they reveal that, despite their partying, they too got into prestigious colleges. Furious, Molly tells Amy they should have enjoyed their time in high school more. She proposes they go to a graduation party held by classmate Nick, and Amy reluctantly agrees.\n\nRealizing that neither of them knows the party\u2019s address, Molly calls Jared, a wealthy classmate who likes her. He brings them to his party aboard a yacht; only his drug-crazed friend Gigi is there, and she feeds the girls strawberries before jumping off the yacht. Amy suggests they go home, but Molly calls a \"[[Malala Yousafzai|Malala]]\" (their code for unconditionally doing what the other wants to do). The girls call a [[Lyft]] and are shocked to be picked up by their principal, Jordan Brown.\n\nTo prepare Amy for potential sex with Ryan, Molly insists they watch [[pornography]], which accidentally plays through the car speakers. Brown drops them off at what they think is Nick's aunt's house but turns out to be the home of their classmate George, who is hosting a [[Murder mystery game|murder mystery party]]. They encounter Gigi, who reveals that the strawberries were laced with powerful hallucinogenic drugs. Amy and Molly experience a [[bad trip]] and hallucinate that they are George's sister's plastic fashion dolls. They manage to escape George's house, but Gigi reveals that Molly secretly likes Nick.\n\nDespite wanting to go home, Amy insists they press on so Molly can consummate her crush on Nick. The girls head to the library, where they see pizza boxes in an online video of Nick\u2019s party and acquire the address from the pizza delivery man. Amy accidentally leaves her phone in his car, and Molly's phone battery lasts just long enough to call their favorite teacher, Miss Fine, who gives them a change of clothes and a ride to Nick's party.\n\nThere, Amy finds Ryan making out with Nick. Heartbroken, she finds Molly and calls her own \"Malala,\u201d which Molly refuses, thinking she still has a chance with Nick. Amy angrily reveals that she is not just spending the summer in [[Botswana]] but taking an entire [[gap year]] there because she resents how Molly always tries to control her life.\n\nThe two friends argue in front of the entire party. Amy runs to the bathroom, finding her classmate Hope already there; they are initially combative until Amy kisses her. Jared appears, and he and Molly have a heartfelt conversation about how no one at school really knows them. Amy and Hope start to have sex, but Amy vomits on her. Cops arrive, and the party-goers scatter. Molly, unable to find Amy, is driven home by \u201cTriple A,\u201d a popular student with a promiscuous reputation, and they bond over the stereotypes they both have endured.\n\nWaking up on graduation day, Molly checks her phone and discovers her classmates praising Amy for creating a diversion at the party, allowing everyone to escape the police while getting herself arrested. Molly visits Amy in jail and apologizes for her manipulative actions, and they reconcile. Learning the pizza delivery man is a serial killer, they trade that information to free Amy, and take Jared's car to graduation. Molly kisses Jared onstage and gives an improvised valedictorian speech, receiving a standing ovation.\n\nA few days later, as Molly helps Amy prepare for her trip to Botswana, Hope visits to give Amy her phone number. Molly drives Amy to the airport, where they share a tearful goodbye. As Molly drives away, Amy jumps in front of her car, saying she has time to hang out before her flight; she suggests they get pancakes, and Molly ecstatically accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cast of Booksmart at SXSW - 32404721467.jpg|thumb|(L:R) [[Noah Galvin]], [[Molly Gordon]], [[Will Forte]], [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Billie Lourd]], [[Kaitlyn Dever]], and [[Beanie Feldstein]] at the film's [[South by Southwest]] premiere]]\n{{Cast listing|\n<!--- End credit title cards --->\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Molly Davidson\n* [[Kaitlyn Dever]] as Amy Antsler\n* [[Jessica Williams (actress)|Jessica Williams]] as Miss Fine\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Charmaine Antsler\n* [[Will Forte]] as Doug Antsler\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Jordan Brown\n* [[Billie Lourd]] as Gigi\n* [[Diana Silvers]] as Hope\n* [[Skyler Gisondo]] as Jared\n* [[Molly Gordon]] as Annabelle, or \"Triple A\"\n* [[Noah Galvin]] as George\n* [[Austin Crute]] as Alan\n* Victoria Ruesga as Ryan\n* Eduardo Franco as Theo\n* Nico Hiraga as Tanner\n* Mason Gooding as Nick Howland\n* [[Mike O'Brien (actor)|Mike O'Brien]] as Pat the Pizza Guy\n<!--- End credits crawl, named or notable only --->\n* Bluesy Burke as Cindy\n* Christopher Avila as Rob\n* [[Stephanie Styles]] as Alison\n* Adam Simon Krist as Dick\n* Gideon Lang as Skip\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Motivational Voice<ref name=\"Thrillist\">{{cite web |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Esther |title=What It's Like Playing Mortal Enemies in 'Booksmart' for Three Real-Life Best Friends |url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/booksmart-movie-beanie-feldstein-molly-gordon-noah-galvin-interview |publisher=[[Thrillist]] |accessdate=May 19, 2019 |date=May 9, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAn early version of the screenplay, ''Book Smart'' by Emily Halpern and [[Sarah Haskins (comedian)|Sarah Haskins]], was circulated in 2009 and appeared on the 2009 [[Black List (survey)|Black List]];<ref name=\"variety-review\" /> in 2014 [[Susanna Fogel]] revised the screenplay, rewriting one lead character as a [[lesbian]] and revising the story so the girls are not seeking boyfriends for the prom, but are going to an after-prom party.<ref name=\"Guerrasi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/booksmart-from-hyped-2009-script-to-a-2019-hit-movie-2019-5 |title=How 'Booksmart' went from a 2009 script collecting dust to this year's must-see movie of the summer |work=[[Business Insider]] |first=Jason |last=Guerrasi |date=May 25, 2019 |accessdate=May 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the revisions, [[Annapurna Pictures]] purchased the screenplay and approached [[Gloria Sanchez Productions]] to produce it; Gloria Sanchez' Jessica Elbaum pitched the screenplay to [[Olivia Wilde]], who read the screenplay and two days later expressed admiration for it.<ref name=\"Guerrasi\"/> [[Megan Ellison]], Chelsea Bernard, David Distenfeld, [[Will Ferrell]], [[Adam McKay]], and Elbaum would serve as producers on the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/olivia-wilde-feature-directing-debut-booksmart/|title=Olivia Wilde to Make Feature Directing Debut With ''Booksmart''|website=[[The Wrap]]|first=Umberto|last=Gonzalez|date=February 16, 2018|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Katie Silberman]] was hired for more revisions in spring 2018, and to update the story.<ref name=\"Guerrasi\"/><ref name=\"Erbland\">{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/booksmart-writer-katie-silberman-interview-1202143169/ |title=How 'Booksmart' Writer Katie Silberman Turned a Beloved Years-Old Script Into the Movie of the Moment |website=[[Indiewire]] |first=Kate |last=Erbland |date=May 21, 2019 |accessdate=May 25, 2019}}</ref> Silberman explored a new concept:\n{{quote|What if the two friends realized that they did high school all wrong?

It stars [[Rebecka Liljeberg]] and [[Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m]] as two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 23 October 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?itemid=37924&type=MOVIE&iv=Basic|title=Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l|publisher=Swedish Film Database|date=23 October 1998|accessdate=16 September 2016}}</ref> and first premiered internationally at the 1998 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe film received an overwhelmingly positive reception<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l (Show me love) (1999) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/show_me_love/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> and won four [[Guldbagge Award]]s (Sweden's official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the [[Teddy Award]] at the 1999 [[Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Moodysson|first=Lukas|title=Show Me Love|date=1998-10-23|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150662/awards?ref_=tt_awd|accessdate=2016-12-06}}</ref> and the [[Special Jury Prize (Karlovy Vary IFF)|Special Jury Prize]] at the [[34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]].\n\nThe Swedish title refers to the small town of [[\u00c5m\u00e5l]] in western Sweden. However, only a few scenes were filmed in \u00c5m\u00e5l,<ref>Robert Wangeby, \"Smygpremi\u00e4r p\u00e5 Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\", ''Provinstidningen Dalsland, 1998.10.13''</ref> and they were not included in the [[final cut privilege|final version]]. The main shooting took place in the nearby town of [[Trollh\u00e4ttan]], the location of producing company [[Film i V\u00e4st]]'s studios.<ref>\"[http://www.filmivast.se/vgrtemplates/RegRightColumn____10900.aspx About Film i V\u00e4st],\" ''Film i V\u00e4st''</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTwo girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of [[\u00c5m\u00e5l]], Sweden. Elin is [[Extraversion and introversion#Extroversion|outgoing]] and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly [[clinical depression|depressed]]. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\n\nAgnes's parents worry about their daughter's [[reclusive]] life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th [[party#Birthday party|birthday party]] for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party.\n\nElin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a [[lesbian]]. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\n\nAfter becoming [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from [[Self-harm|cutting herself]]. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in \u00c5m\u00e5l. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving \u00c5m\u00e5l and going to [[Stockholm]]. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to [[hitchhike]] to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\n\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her [[virginity]] during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to '[[coming out|out]]' their relationship to the school.\n\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m]] as Elin Olsson\n* [[Rebecka Liljeberg]] as Agnes Ahlberg\n* [[Erica Carlson]] as Jessica Olsson\n* Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth\n* Stefan H\u00f6rberg as Markus\n* Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria\n* Ralph Carlsson as Agnes's father, Olof\n* Maria Hedborg as Agnes's mother, Karin\n* Axel Widegren as Agnes's little brother, Oskar\n* Jill Ung as Elin's and Jessica's mother, Birgitta\n\n==Title==\nThe original title of the film, ''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l'', refers to the girls' feelings about their small town: In a key scene Elin shouts in desperation \"''varf\u00f6r m\u00e5ste vi bo i fucking j\u00e4vla kuk-\u00c5m\u00e5l?''\" (which roughly translates to \"why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-\u00c5m\u00e5l?\").\n\nAccording to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden's candidate for the [[Academy Awards]], though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/12626126|title=Gareth Griffiths, An \u00c5m\u00e5l State of Mind, in ''City + Cinema: Essays on the specificity of location in film'', Datutop 29, 2007.|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"71stSubmissions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/98.11.19.html|title=45 Countries Submit Films for Oscar Consideration|date=19 November 1998|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219094343/http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/98.11.19.html|archivedate=19 February 1999|url-status=unfit|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref> The Hollywood industry magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' refused to run an advertisement for ''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l''. Thus, American distributor [[Strand Releasing]] asked for a new title. Moodysson took the new title from [[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|the song at the end of the film]], by [[Robyn]].

Local politicians campaigned to get the title changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way and even undermine it as an economic centre.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the [[Film i V\u00e4st]] studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including \u00c5m\u00e5l.\n\nHowever, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release, the town of \u00c5m\u00e5l has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town's name is missing from the English title. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l Festival.\"\n\n===Critical and commercial response===\n''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l'' received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998\u20139, with a total audience of 867,576 and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2,100,000.<ref>[http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=8161 Lumiere data base on film admissions released in Europe].</ref>\n\nHowever, some reports outside Sweden incorrectly stated that in Sweden the film had even outgrossed the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title = Show Me Love review |first = Roger |last = Ebert |authorlink = Roger Ebert |url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000324/REVIEWS/3240302/1023 |newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date = March 24, 2000 |accessdate = July 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050526124458/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000324/REVIEWS/3240302/1023 |url-status = live |archivedate = May 26, 2005 }}</ref> In fact, ''Titanic'' had over twice as many viewers as ''Show Me Love'' in Sweden in 1998.<ref>http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=8001 ''Titanic'' received an audience in Sweden in 1998 of 2,166,584.</ref> Based on 39 reviews collected by the film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 90% of critics gave ''Show Me Love'' a positive review.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> It is among the top ten of the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.<ref>{{cite web |title = Debate produces list of films that children should see |url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/watchthis/ |publisher = [[British Film Institute]] |year = 2005 |accessdate = July 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202140316/http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/watchthis/ |url-status = dead |archivedate = February 2, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[Autostraddle]] placed it at number one on its Top 10 Best Lesbian Movies list.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/top-ten-best-lesbian-movies-yes-thats-right-10-queer-girl-movies-that-dont-suck/|title=Top Ten Best Lesbian Movies: 10 Queer Movies That Don't Suck.|date=2009-08-19|work=Autostraddle|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural impact===\nAccording to Russian singer [[Lena Katina]], producer [[Ivan Shapovalov]] was inspired to create her famous and controversial pop duo [[t.A.T.u.]] after the release of this film.<ref>http://tatumedia.com/post/13311041014/lena-katinas-interview-in-story-caravan</ref> The track \"[[Show Me Love (t.A.T.u. song)|Show Me Love]]\" is featured in their album ''[[200 km/h in the Wrong Lane]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack was released through [[Columbia Records]] and consists of songs in [[English language|English]] and [[Swedish language]].

It stars [[Rebecka Liljeberg]] and [[Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m]] as two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 23 October 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?itemid=37924&type=MOVIE&iv=Basic|title=Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l|publisher=Swedish Film Database|date=23 October 1998|accessdate=16 September 2016}}</ref> and first premiered internationally at the 1998 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe film received an overwhelmingly positive reception<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l (Show me love) (1999) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/show_me_love/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> and won four [[Guldbagge Award]]s (Sweden's official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the [[Teddy Award]] at the 1999 [[Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Moodysson|first=Lukas|title=Show Me Love|date=1998-10-23|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150662/awards?ref_=tt_awd|accessdate=2016-12-06}}</ref> and the [[Special Jury Prize (Karlovy Vary IFF)|Special Jury Prize]] at the [[34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]].\n\nThe Swedish title refers to the small town of [[\u00c5m\u00e5l]] in western Sweden. However, only a few scenes were filmed in \u00c5m\u00e5l,<ref>Robert Wangeby, \"Smygpremi\u00e4r p\u00e5 Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l\", ''Provinstidningen Dalsland, 1998.10.13''</ref> and they were not included in the [[final cut privilege|final version]]. The main shooting took place in the nearby town of [[Trollh\u00e4ttan]], the location of producing company [[Film i V\u00e4st]]'s studios.<ref>\"[http://www.filmivast.se/vgrtemplates/RegRightColumn____10900.aspx About Film i V\u00e4st],\" ''Film i V\u00e4st''</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTwo girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of [[\u00c5m\u00e5l]], Sweden. Elin is [[Extraversion and introversion#Extroversion|outgoing]] and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly [[clinical depression|depressed]]. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\n\nAgnes's parents worry about their daughter's [[reclusive]] life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th [[party#Birthday party|birthday party]] for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party.\n\nElin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a [[lesbian]]. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\n\nAfter becoming [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from [[Self-harm|cutting herself]]. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in \u00c5m\u00e5l. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving \u00c5m\u00e5l and going to [[Stockholm]]. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to [[hitchhike]] to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\n\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her [[virginity]] during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a [[climax (narrative)|climactic]] scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to '[[coming out|out]]' their relationship to the school.\n\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexandra Dahlstr\u00f6m]] as Elin Olsson\n* [[Rebecka Liljeberg]] as Agnes Ahlberg\n* [[Erica Carlson]] as Jessica Olsson\n* Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth\n* Stefan H\u00f6rberg as Markus\n* Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria\n* Ralph Carlsson as Agnes's father, Olof\n* Maria Hedborg as Agnes's mother, Karin\n* Axel Widegren as Agnes's little brother, Oskar\n* Jill Ung as Elin's and Jessica's mother, Birgitta\n\n==Title==\nThe original title of the film, ''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l'', refers to the girls' feelings about their small town: In a key scene Elin shouts in desperation \"''varf\u00f6r m\u00e5ste vi bo i fucking j\u00e4vla kuk-\u00c5m\u00e5l?''\" (which roughly translates to \"why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-\u00c5m\u00e5l?\").\n\nAccording to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden's candidate for the [[Academy Awards]], though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/12626126|title=Gareth Griffiths, An \u00c5m\u00e5l State of Mind, in ''City + Cinema: Essays on the specificity of location in film'', Datutop 29, 2007.|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"71stSubmissions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/98.11.19.html|title=45 Countries Submit Films for Oscar Consideration|date=19 November 1998|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219094343/http://www.oscars.org/pressreleases/98.11.19.html|archivedate=19 February 1999|url-status=unfit|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref> The Hollywood industry magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' refused to run an advertisement for ''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l''.

Local politicians campaigned to get the title changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way and even undermine it as an economic centre.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the [[Film i V\u00e4st]] studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including \u00c5m\u00e5l.\n\nHowever, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release, the town of \u00c5m\u00e5l has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town's name is missing from the English title. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music \"Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l Festival.\"\n\n===Critical and commercial response===\n''Fucking \u00c5m\u00e5l'' received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998-9, with a total audience of 867,576 and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2,100,000.<ref>[http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=8161 Lumiere data base on film admissions released in Europe].</ref>\n\nHowever, some reports outside Sweden incorrectly stated that in Sweden the film had even outgrossed the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title = Show Me Love review |first = Roger |last = Ebert |authorlink = Roger Ebert |url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000324/REVIEWS/3240302/1023 |newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date = March 24, 2000 |accessdate = July 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050526124458/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000324/REVIEWS/3240302/1023 |url-status = live |archivedate = May 26, 2005 }}</ref> In fact, ''Titanic'' had over twice as many viewers as ''Show Me Love'' in Sweden in 1998.<ref>http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=8001 ''Titanic'' received an audience in Sweden in 1998 of 2,166,584.</ref> Based on 39 reviews collected by the film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 90% of critics gave ''Show Me Love'' a positive review.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> It is among the top ten of the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.<ref>{{cite web |title = Debate produces list of films that children should see |url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/watchthis/ |publisher = [[British Film Institute]] |year = 2005 |accessdate = July 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202140316/http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/watchthis/ |url-status = dead |archivedate = February 2, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[Autostraddle]] placed it at number one on its Top 10 Best Lesbian Movies list.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/top-ten-best-lesbian-movies-yes-thats-right-10-queer-girl-movies-that-dont-suck/|title=Top Ten Best Lesbian Movies: 10 Queer Movies That Don't Suck.|date=2009-08-19|work=Autostraddle|access-date=2017-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural impact===\nAccording to Russian singer [[Lena Katina]], producer [[Ivan Shapovalov]] was inspired to create her famous and controversial pop duo [[t.A.T.u.]] after the release of this film.<ref>http://tatumedia.com/post/13311041014/lena-katinas-interview-in-story-caravan</ref> The track \"[[Show Me Love (t.A.T.u. song)|Show Me Love]]\" is featured in their album ''[[200 km/h in the Wrong Lane]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack was released through [[Columbia Records]] and consists of songs in [[English language|English]] and [[Swedish language]].

Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH\u2014called Chess Boxing Global, CBG\u2014was founded, that {{as of|2013|May|lc=y}}, is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez]]' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division-winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions.

Chess and boxing rounds alternate, and a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing\n* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess\n* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]\n* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).\n**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other\n* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the [[first-move advantage in chess]]). This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\nLike [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[weight class]]es. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ({{as of|2014|October|lc=y}}):\n\n==== Men (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 154.324&nbsp;lbs (70 kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 176.37&nbsp;lbs (80&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416&nbsp;lbs (90&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)<ref>Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052145/http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ |date=2016-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==== Women (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 121.254&nbsp;lbs (55&nbsp;kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 143.3&nbsp;lbs (65&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347&nbsp;lbs (75&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\n== Particular requirements and training ==\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\n== Champions ==\n{{further|List of Chess boxing champions}}\n\nBetween 2003\u20132013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. {{as of|2013}}, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n=== WCBO (2003\u20132012) ===\n\n==== World champions ====\n* 2003: Iepe Rubingh {{NLD}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Amsterdam against Jean Louis Veenstra {{NLD}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/you-thought-we-were-making-it-up- Chessboxing Amsterdam]</ref>\n* 2007: Frank Stoldt {{DEU}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against David Depto {{USA}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/cheboxing-world-championship-2008-in-berlin Stoldt vs. Depto]</ref>\n* 2008: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Frank Stoldt {{DEU}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-ruians-are-coming-in-cheboxing Stoldt vs. Sazhin]</ref>\n* 2009: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Krasnoyarsk against Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}}<ref>Iepe.net: [http://www.iepe.net/dada/mail.cgi/archive/WCBO/20091203163513/ Sazhin vs. Chernobaev]</ref>\n\n==== European champions ====\n* 2005: [[Tihomir Dovramadjiev]] {{BGR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Andreas Dilschneider {{DEU}}<ref>Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42736496.html Dilschneider Teasertext]</ref>\n* 2010: Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in London against Andrew Costello {{GBR}}\n* 2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Darius Rolkis {{LTU}}\n*2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Dmitri Pechurin {{RUS}}\n* 2016: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Daniel Wakeham  {{GBR}}\n\n=== CBG (starting 2013) ===\n{{update section|date=May 2017}}\n* 2013: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in Moscow against Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}}\n* 2013: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Moscow against Shaliesh Tripathi {{IND}}\n* 2013: Sven Rooch {{DEU}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Moscow against Jonathan Rodriguez Vega {{ESP}}\n\n== Major organizations ==\n\n=== World Chess Boxing Organisation ===\nThe [[World Chess Boxing Organisation|World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V.]] (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing.

Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH\u2014called Chess Boxing Global, CBG\u2014was founded, that {{as of|2013|May|lc=y}}, is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez]]' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division-winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions.

Chess and boxing rounds alternate, and a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing\n* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess\n* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]\n* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).\n**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other\n* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the [[first-move advantage in chess]]). This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\nLike [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[weight class]]es. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ({{as of|2014|October|lc=y}}):\n\n==== Men (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 154.324&nbsp;lbs (70 kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 176.37&nbsp;lbs (80&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416&nbsp;lbs (90&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)<ref>Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052145/http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ |date=2016-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==== Women (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 121.254&nbsp;lbs (55&nbsp;kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 143.3&nbsp;lbs (65&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347&nbsp;lbs (75&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\n== Particular requirements and training ==\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\n== Champions ==\n{{further|List of Chess boxing champions}}\n\nBetween 2003\u20132013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. {{as of|2013}}, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n=== WCBO (2003\u20132012) ===\n\n==== World champions ====\n* 2003: Iepe Rubingh {{NLD}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Amsterdam against Jean Louis Veenstra {{NLD}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/you-thought-we-were-making-it-up- Chessboxing Amsterdam]</ref>\n* 2007: Frank Stoldt {{DEU}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against David Depto {{USA}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/cheboxing-world-championship-2008-in-berlin Stoldt vs. Depto]</ref>\n* 2008: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Frank Stoldt {{DEU}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-ruians-are-coming-in-cheboxing Stoldt vs. Sazhin]</ref>\n* 2009: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Krasnoyarsk against Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}}<ref>Iepe.net: [http://www.iepe.net/dada/mail.cgi/archive/WCBO/20091203163513/ Sazhin vs. Chernobaev]</ref>\n\n==== European champions ====\n* 2005: [[Tihomir Dovramadjiev]] {{BGR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Andreas Dilschneider {{DEU}}<ref>Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42736496.html Dilschneider Teasertext]</ref>\n* 2010: Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in London against Andrew Costello {{GBR}}\n* 2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Darius Rolkis {{LTU}}\n*2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Dmitri Pechurin {{RUS}}\n* 2016: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Daniel Wakeham  {{GBR}}\n\n=== CBG (starting 2013) ===\n{{update section|date=May 2017}}\n* 2013: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in Moscow against Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}}\n* 2013: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Moscow against Shaliesh Tripathi {{IND}}\n* 2013: Sven Rooch {{DEU}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Moscow against Jonathan Rodriguez Vega {{ESP}}\n\n== Major organizations ==\n\n=== World Chess Boxing Organisation ===\nThe [[World Chess Boxing Organisation|World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V.]] (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing.

Now elderly, she runs the Gr\u00fcnderzeit Museum, fulfilling her dream of living as a woman from the turn of the 20th century. Scenes of her life are dramatized. Two actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte and she plays herself in old age.\n\nLife was difficult for Charlotte, growing up as Lothar Berfelde in [[Nazi]] Germany during World War II. An effeminate boy, Lothar enjoyed cleaning and dusting at the home of a benevolent great uncle; an early desire to live as a woman finally found an outlet on a vacation to [[Eastern Prussia]] in the household of \"aunt\" Luise, a transgender man, who allows the youth to try out female outfits and dress at home as a girl, and giving Lothar the book ''The Transvestite'' by Dr [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] to read. Luise also respects the youth's privacy when he finds him having sex in the barn with a farm boy.\n\nBack in Berlin, after the death of a great uncle, the young Lothar is found at the complete mercy of his brutal father. Trying to save his mother and himself from his father's punishments and threats, Lothar bludgeons his father to death, a crime for which he is psychiatrically evaluated and imprisoned. The defeat of Germany during the war and the Allied invasion sets the boy free. Wandering through the street of Berlin, he barely escapes being killed as a deserter by German soldiers.\n\nBy 1946 Lothar has come to identify herself as a feminine being in a masculine body. She lives now full-time as a woman under the name Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, \"Charlotte\" or \"Lottchen\" being similar to Lothar, and Mahlsdorf referring to the section of Berlin where she lives. She moves into the destroyed Friedrishfelde castle and spends years and a lot of hard work trying to restore it. But eventually, she is expelled by the East German authorities. Working as a domestic in the household of Herbert von Zitzenau, an elderly equestrian officer, she is seduced by her employer and they start a sexual relationship. She explains that she preferred older lovers feeling protected by them the way women do. That affair lasted several years until Zitzenau's health declined and death.\n\nEven though life for gays is difficult under the communist regime of [[East Germany]], they find their way around. Cruising a public restroom, Charlotte meets Joechen, a lover with whom she could be a real woman. Their relation with [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] role-playing last for 27 years until Joechen's death.\n\nFor more than 30 years Charlotte manages to live her life as a woman in East Germany. She preserves the entire contents of [[East Berlin]]'s first (and only for many years) gay bar, after the DDR government closed the bar, and moved to demolish the building. Its contents were transferred to the Gr\u00fcnderzeit Museum in Mahlsdorf run by Charlotte and a lesbian couple. In 1989 the elderly Charlotte, very much active, takes a role in the first East German gay film: Heiner Carow's ''Coming Out''. Its premiere coincides with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].

Now elderly, she runs the Gr\u00fcnderzeit Museum, fulfilling her dream of living as a woman from the turn of the 20th century. Scenes of her life are dramatized. Two actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte and she plays herself in old age.\n\nLife was difficult for Charlotte, growing up as Lothar Berfelde in [[Nazi]] Germany during World War II. An effeminate boy, Lothar enjoyed cleaning and dusting at the home of a benevolent great uncle; an early desire to live as a woman finally found an outlet on a vacation to [[Eastern Prussia]] in the household of \"aunt\" Luise, a transgender man, who allows the youth to try out female outfits and dress at home as a girl, and giving Lothar the book ''The Transvestite'' by Dr [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] to read. Luise also respects the youth's privacy when he finds him having sex in the barn with a farm boy.\n\nBack in Berlin, after the death of a great uncle, the young Lothar is found at the complete mercy of his brutal father. Trying to save his mother and himself from his father's punishments and threats, Lothar bludgeons his father to death, a crime for which he is psychiatrically evaluated and imprisoned. The defeat of Germany during the war and the Allied invasion sets the boy free. Wandering through the street of Berlin, he barely escapes being killed as a deserter by German soldiers.\n\nBy 1946 Lothar has come to identify herself as a feminine being in a masculine body. She lives now full-time as a woman under the name Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, \"Charlotte\" or \"Lottchen\" being similar to Lothar, and Mahlsdorf referring to the section of Berlin where she lives. She moves into the destroyed Friedrishfelde castle and spends years and a lot of hard work trying to restore it. But eventually, she is expelled by the East German authorities. Working as a domestic in the household of Herbert von Zitzenau, an elderly equestrian officer, she is seduced by her employer and they start a sexual relationship. She explains that she preferred older lovers feeling protected by them the way women do. That affair lasted several years until Zitzenau\u2019s health declined and death.\n\nEven though life for gays is difficult under the communist regime of [[East Germany]], they find their way around. Cruising a public restroom, Charlotte meets Joechen, a lover with whom she could be a real woman. Their relation with [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] role-playing last for 27 years until Joechen\u2019s death.\n\nFor more than 30 years Charlotte manages to live her life as a woman in East Germany. She preserves the entire contents of [[East Berlin]]'s first (and only for many years) gay bar, after the DDR government closed the bar, and moved to demolish the building. Its contents were transferred to the Gr\u00fcnderzeit Museum in Mahlsdorf run by Charlotte and a lesbian couple. In 1989 the elderly Charlotte, very much active, takes a role in the first East German gay film: Heiner Carow's ''Coming Out''. Its premiere coincides with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]. But even in a unified Germany Charlotte has to face many problems. The German government takes the Gr\u00fcnderzeit Museum and its contents from Charlotte's hands and she and her gay friends are attacked by [[neo-Nazis]] during  the first joint East\u2013West gay and lesbian gathering. In 1992 her labor is recognized when she receives the Cross of the Order of Merit from the government for furthering the cause of sexual freedom.\n\n==Cast==\nTwo actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte, and she plays herself in the later years.\n* [[Charlotte von Mahlsdorf]]  - Herself\n* Jens Taschner \u2013 Lothar age 15-17\n* Ichgola Androgyn - Charlotte age 20-40\n* Robert Dietl - Herbert von Zitzenau\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Kuzniar, Alice A, ''The Queer German Cinema'', Stanford University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8047-3995-1}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0104475|title=Ich bin meine eigene Frau}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ich bin meine eigene Frau}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:German films]]\n[[Category:1990s LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:German biographical films]]\n[[Category:German LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Teen LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about trans women]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Rosa von Praunheim]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_My_Own_Woman"}
