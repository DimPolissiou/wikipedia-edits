APDA sponsors over 50 tournaments a year, all in a parliamentary format, as well as a national championship in late April.  It also administers the [[North American Debating Championship]] with the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate]] (CUSID) every year in January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apdaweb.org/about/history |title=Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &#124; American College Debate Association - About |publisher=Apda Web |date=January 23, 1981}}</ref> Although it is mainly funded by its member universities, APDA is an entirely student-run organization.\n\n==Organizational structure==\nAPDA comprises about 80 universities, mainly in the [[U.S. Northeast|Northeast]], ranging as far north as [[Maine]] and as far south as [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=March 24, 2019 | url=http://apda.online/about/contacts/ | title=Contacts - American Parliamentary Debate Association | date=2019 | website=apda.online}}</ref> APDA includes both private and public colleges and universities.\n\nAPDA members stage weekly debating tournaments, each at a different university and occurring throughout the academic year.  Most weekends have two or three debating tournaments: at least one will be north of [[New York City]] and south of New York City, in order to shorten transport time.  However, centrally located tournaments or historically large tournaments, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], will be \u201cunopposed\u201d, meaning that they will be the only tournament on that particular weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apda.online/schedule/|title=Schedule 2018-19 \u2013 American Parliamentary Debate Association|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> Individual schools must ensure that their tournaments meet a broad set of APDA guidelines,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=APDA_By-laws#Section_5.08_Tournaments|title=APDA By-laws - APDAWeb Wiki|website=history.apdaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> but are free to tinker with their tournament formats.\n\nThere are a number of tournaments in which APDA<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=APDA_By-laws#Section_3.01_Power_of_Board_and_Qualification_of_Trustees|title=Board of Trustees - APDA By-laws - APDAWeb Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=history.apdaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> plays a direct role.  Most prominently, APDA sponsors a national championship at the end of each year.  Unlike all other tournaments, debating at Nationals is limited to one team per university, plus any additional teams who \u201cqualified\u201d for Nationals during that debate season.  There are several ways to qualify for Nationals: The most common through the 2006\u20132007 season was to reach the final round of a tournament.  Starting with the 2007\u20132008 season, qualification was earned through year-long performance, gauged by how far debaters advance at tournaments of varying sizes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=APDA_By-laws#Section_5.09_National_Debate_Championship|title=APDA By-laws - APDAWeb Wiki|website=history.apdaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, APDA sponsors a novice tournament at the beginning of the season, a pro-am tournament once per semester, and the [[North American Debating Championships]], which are held every other year in the United States and include top teams from the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nAPDA also has a ranking system which combines the results of all of the year's tournaments.  Both individual speakers and two-member teams can earn points based on the results of the tournament; these points also scale up depending on the tournament's size.  At the end of the debate season, APDA gives awards to the top ten teams, speakers, and novices of the year.\n\nAPDA is an entirely student-run organization.  The APDA board members are students from various host institutions, and most of the tournaments are completely organized by the host school's debate team.  Some teams do have professional coaches, but these are usually recently retired debaters who wish to stay involved with the circuit.\n\n==Tournaments==\nWeekly debating tournaments are the core of APDA.  While numerous schools slightly alter the tournament format, the general format is fairly constant.  Tournaments usually start on Friday afternoon and end on Saturday evening.  Five preliminary rounds are held, three on Friday and two on Saturday. The first round is randomly paired, while remaining rounds are bracketed, meaning that teams with the same record face each other.  Preliminary rounds generally have only one judge, most frequently a debater from the host school.  After five rounds, the \u201cbreak\u201d is announced, consisting of the top eight teams at the tournament.  These teams compete in single-elimination quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, judged by progressively larger panels of judges, and a tournament winner is crowned. Separate semifinals and then finals are held on the basis of the previous five rounds for the top novice team. Trophies are awarded to the top speakers, top teams, and top novice (first-year) debaters.  Certain tournaments tinker with the format, having more or fewer preliminary rounds and larger or smaller breaks; the national championships, for instance, generally have one additional preliminary round and one additional elimination round.\n\n==Format==\nDebates at APDA tournaments follow a debating style known as American Parliamentary Debate, which is modeled loosely on the procedure and decorum of the [[UK Parliament]]. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge.\n\n===Flow of the round===\nA round of debate features two teams of two debaters each: the ''Government'' team, including the ''Prime Minister'' and the ''Member of Government'', and the ''Opposition'' team, including the ''Leader of the Opposition'' and the ''Member of the Opposition''.\n\nSix speeches in all are delivered, varying in length:\n* Prime Minister's Constructive: 7 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Leader of the Opposition's Constructive: 8 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Member of Government: 8 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Member of the Opposition: 8 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Leader of the Opposition's Rebuttal: 4 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Prime Minister's Rebuttal: 5 minutes, 30 seconds\n\n===Points of information===\nA debater may rise to ask a ''point of information'' (POI) of an opponent during the opponent's speech. POIs are only permitted during the first four speeches, though prohibited in the first and final minutes of each speech. The speaking debater can choose to hear the POI or to dismiss it politely. Traditionally when standing on a point of information some debaters extend one hand palm up, holding the back of the head with the other. This pose originated in old British Parliamentary etiquette: an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] would adopt the position to secure his wig and show that he was not carrying a weapon.<ref name=\"poi-origin\">{{cite web\n|url= https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/38/10/focus/\n|title= The rules of engagement: McGill debaters dedicated to disagreement\n|accessdate= 2006-08-01\n|last= Roberts|first= Jeff\n|date= 2006-01-26\n|publisher= McGill Reporter\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060818182047/http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/38/10/focus/| archivedate= 18 August 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\nIt is generally considered good form to accept at least one POI during a speech.\n\n===Resolutions===\nIn most rounds, there is no resolution, and the Government team may propose whatever case it wishes consistent with the standards below.  Certain tournaments provide both teams with a motion to which the case must conform 15 minutes before the round starts.\n\nSince the Opposition team arrives at the round with no prior knowledge of the case, some kinds of resolutions are not permitted to ensure a fair debate. If Opposition feels that the round fits any one of these categories, they may point this out during the Leader's speech. If the judge agrees, Opposition wins. There are five kinds of disallowed resolutions:\n* ''tight'' resolutions, which are deemed too one-sided (\u201c[[racism]] is bad\u201d, for example);\n* [[truism]]s (\u201cBarack Obama was the greatest Democratic president of the U.S. since Bill Clinton\u201d);\n* [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] (\u201cGood citizens should help the poor,\u201d with goodness defined as \"a willingness to do charitable acts\");\n* [[status quo]] resolutions (\u201cThe [[United States of America|United States]] should have [[jury trial]]s\u201d);\n* ''specific-knowledge'' cases, i.e., cases which are unfair toward the Opposition team because they require highly obscure knowledge to oppose effectively (\"NASA should replace the current sealant used on the space shuttle with hypoxynucleotide-C4598\")\n\nAside from these five limitations, virtually any topic for debate is fair game, as long as there are two coherent and debatable sides.  Debaters may also present ''opp-choice'' cases, in which the government team offers the opposition team the chance to choose which side of a topic the government team will defend in the round.\n\n===Adjudication===\nA judge listens to the round and provides quantitative and qualitative assessments of the round as a whole and of the individual speakers. Some rounds use a panel of judges. Judges are usually debaters themselves, but non-debater judges, or ''lay judges'', are sometimes used.\n\n===Comparison to other styles===\nThe APDA style is generally seen as occupying a middle ground between the styles of\nCUSID and [[National Parliamentary Debate Association|NPDA]].  It is somewhat more rule-oriented and structured than the CUSID style, as point-by-point argumentation and careful structure are considered very important.  It also emphasizes detailed analysis and de-emphasizes oratory as compared to CUSID. However, APDA style is less structured and theoretical than the [[National Parliamentary Debate Association|NPDA]] style, and demands less use of technical debate formalisms.\n\n==Types of cases==\nAPDA's format allows for an enormous variety of cases.  This list is ''not'' comprehensive, but should be treated as a general sketch of the case climate.\n\n===Public policy===\nCases about public policy are among the most common cases on APDA.  They include common public policy debates ([[education voucher|school vouchers]], [[term limit]]s, [[euthanasia]], [[capital punishment]], race-based [[affirmative action]]) as well as more unconventional ideas (mandatory [[organ donation]], [[proxy voting]] for children, private criminal prosecution, and innumerable others). [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] policy proposals, such as abolishing the [[minimum wage]] or abolishing [[Paternalism|paternalistic laws]], are particularly popular.  Cases involving the policies of particular organizations are popular as well, such as debates surrounding university speech codes.  Additionally, broad social questions can be discussed without centering the case around a government actor; \u201cAre [[trade unions]], all things considered, a good thing for society?\u201d is a perfectly acceptable opp-choice debate case.\n\n===Political theory===\nAbstract questions about political philosophy are also popular topics of debate.\nCases about the relative benefits of the [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] \u201c[[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]]\u201d versus the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] \u201c[[state of nature]]\u201d, for instance, are commonplace.  These rounds will generally be folded into moral hypotheticals; for instance, rather than a team actually proposing that the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] is a worthwhile political theory, a team might argue that economic human rights should be included in constitutions, and use the veil of ignorance as a justification.\n\n===Law and legal theory===\nAll aspects of law are fair game on APDA, including constitutional law (e.g. whether a Supreme Court case was wrongly decided), procedural law (e.g. whether standards of proof should differ for criminal and civil law) and abstract legal theory (e.g. whether [[retributive justice]] is a moral justification for the [[criminal justice]] system).\n\n===Foreign policy===\nMany aspects of American and international foreign policy make for excellent debate rounds.  Various aspects of policy related to [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[North Korea]], and [[Cuba]] are frequent debate topics.\n\n===Moral hypotheticals===\nHypothetical moral dilemmas are popular topics for debate, given that they can be discussed with a minimum of specific knowledge and a maximum of argumentation.  They can range from completely fantastical situations (\u201cIf you had definitive proof that one particular [[religion]] was the true [[religion]], should you reveal it to society?\u201d) to unlikely occurrences (\u201cShould you kill one person to save five other people?\u201d) to dilemmas we face every day (\u201cYou see a [[homelessness|homeless]] person on the street, should you give him money you have in your pocket?\u201d)  The infinite number of hypothetical situations that can give rise to moral dilemmas make many moral hypothetical cases unique.\n\n=== Abstract philosophy ===\nAlthough somewhat less common than tangible moral hypotheticals, all aspects of philosophy make their way into debate rounds.  Ethics is probably the most debated field of philosophy, including both abstract [[metaethics]] and modern ethical problems like the [[trolley problem]].  However, [[philosophy of religion]] (\u201cIs it rational to be an [[atheism|atheist]]?\u201d), [[philosophy of mind]] (\u201cCan a computer have mental states?\u201d) and even [[philosophy of language]] (\u201cDoes love result from appreciation of someone\u2019s properties, or does appreciation of someone\u2019s properties result from love?\u201d) can result in excellent rounds.\n\n=== Time-space ===\nOne type of case, common on APDA but rare on other circuits, is the time-space case.  This places the speaker in the position of some real-life, fictional, or historical figure.  Only information accessible to a person in that position is legal in this type of round.  For instance, \u201cYou are [[Socrates]].  Don\u2019t commit suicide\u201d could not reference events that took place after [[Socrates]]\u2019 death.  The speaker can be a fictional character (\u201cYou are [[Homer Simpson]].  Do not sell your soul\u201d), a historical character (\u201cYou are [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Do not sign the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation proclamation]]\u201d) or virtually any other sentient individual.\n\nOne notable type of time-space case is the historical hypothetical case, in which decisions made by particular historical figures are debated from their historical context.  Debates surrounding, for instance, [[American Civil War|Civil War]] strategy or [[World War I]] alliances are commonplace.  These types of debates often require a detailed knowledge of history.\n\nTime-space cases are a particularly sensitive type of case for the government, because their setting must leave room for the opposition to defeat the case even if that would go against the historical outcome already known to everyone in the room.\n\n=== Comedy cases ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nTeams occasionally choose to debate very funny or silly topics in rounds.  In this case, the round often becomes a contest over wit and style rather than pure analysis.  \u201c[[Disneyland]] should [[secession|secede]] from the United States\u201d or something like the following:\n\n\u201cThe Federal [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP]] program should be replaced with a National Buffet Program where those members of the new improved program shall be granted full and unfettered access to a nationwide chain of all you can eat buffets (with post-meal resting areas) that they may access via a new government issued \"buffet\" card to promote consumption of prodigious amounts of food and the free and easy movement of cardholders throughout the land.\" This case was actually proposed, and victorious in the final round of the 1993 University of Pennsylvania Tournament. This is an example of this type of round, which have been known to get quite bizarre.\n\nNumerous cases are run on APDA that do not fit into any of the categories; case construction is a skill that requires significant creativity, and coming up with unique debate topics is a very important skill on the APDA circuit.\n\n== History ==\nWhile parliamentary debate had been popular in America for some time, there was no proper organization that existed to schedule tournaments, officiate a national championship or resolve disputes. The result was a bizarrely ordered chaos. Following the Glasgow World Championship in 1981, APDA was founded.<ref name=\"The Founding of APDA\">{{cite web|title=The Founding of APDA|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=The_Founding_of_APDA|publisher=APDA|access-date=21 November 2013}}</ref> It has dramatically grown in size since then.

Gertler and Tom Massaro\n\n===Evolutionary changes===\nAmerican parliamentary debate did not begin with APDA.  Three circuits operated in the U.S. prior to its creation, in the Northeast, Midwest, and California.  The [[University of Chicago]] tournament was considered the ''de facto'' national championship due to its central location and its place as the last tournament on the calendar, and was selected to host the first APDA Nationals in 1981.  APDA started as a way to coordinate tournament schedules among the Northeast schools and to provide a single point of contact for what was then a close working relationship with [[CUSID]].<ref name=\"The Founding of APDA\"/>\n\nTournaments were either five or six rounds, and the length of speeches slightly different from today, at 8, 8, 8, 12, and 4 minutes.  The 12-minute speech by the Opposition could be divided into 8 and 4, in which case the Leader of the Opposition took the Opposition's first 8-minute speech, the Member of the Opposition the second 8, and the leader finished with 4 minutes of pure rebuttal.  The decision on whether to split was tactical, as a strong 12-minute speech could be hard for the Prime Minister to rebut in 4, but a poor one could be disastrous.  Often, the decision to split was made after the Prime Minister's opening speech, when the Opposition had some notion of the strength of the Government case.\n\nPre- and early-APDA debate style was much closer to CUSID style, with the government required to debate the resolution provided by the tournament organizers. Teams could be creative in using alternative or pun-based definitions for common words used in the original resolution. This was what was originally meant by \"squirreling\" the resolution. A government could choose to debate \"The U.S. should pull out\" seriously by defining what the U.S. should pull out of\u2014a foreign entanglement or the [[United Nations]], for example.  It could be squirreled by choosing an uncommon phrase abbreviated U.S. -- the \"usual seatbelt\" would make it a case against [[airbag]]s or other passive restraint systems in cars.  Further value was placed on analyzing the underlying core assumptions of a case; in the \"usual seatbelt\" example, the assumption was that safety should be an individual's personal choice rather than mandated by government.  The best teams were able to argue both the specific case and the general philosophical point.  Cases that seemed to be prepared in advance and linked awkwardly to the resolution were strongly discouraged, and judges were trained to deduct points accordingly.\n\nBy about 1987, several factors had led debates to cease relating directly to the resolutions.  Among these were APDA's increasing popularity with debaters accustomed to high school on-topic ([[National Forensic League|NFL]] or [http://cedadebate.org/ CEDA]) formats, a notable incidence of poorly written resolutions that were hard to debate even when squirreled, and the fact that at many schools, the supply of judges willing to sit through training sessions on the fine points of parliamentary style was not sufficient for increasingly larger tournaments.  The result was a rise in prepared cases, a greater emphasis on policy prescriptions and specifics, less-strict adherence to the rules and customs of Parliament, and less opportunity for broad philosophical debate.\n\nWhile the content of debate rounds has changed significantly, the spirit of today's APDA tournaments is very similar to the original ones, as friendly rivals renew acquaintance every week during the season.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Member organizations===\n{{colbegin}}\n* American University Debate Society<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audebate.org|title=American University Debate Society - The premier debating society of American University.|author=|date=|website=AUDebate.org|access-date=May 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517074628/http://audebate.org/|archive-date=May 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Amherst Debate Society<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/campuslife/studentgroups/debate_society|title=Debate Society - Home|website=Amherst.edu|access-date=May 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413025422/https://www.amherst.edu/campuslife/studentgroups/debate_society/|archive-date=April 13, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Bates Brooks-Quimby Debate Council<ref>[http://batesdebate.org]</ref>\n* [[Boston University Debate Society]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425191806/http://people.bu.edu/budebate/]\n* Brandeis Academic Debate And Speech Society (BADASS) [http://debate.brandeis.edu/]\n* [[Brown Debating Union]] [http://browndebate.org/]\n* Bryn Mawr Parliamentary Debate Society\n* Catholic University\tof America Debate Society [http://cua.campusgroups.com/debate/about/]\n* Columbia Debate Society [http://www.columbiadebate.com/]\n* Cornell Debate Association [http://sao.cornell.edu/SO/org/11-12/304]\n* Dartmouth College Parliamentary Debate Team [http://dartmouthparlidebate.blogspot.com/]\n* DePaul Debate Society [http://depauldebate.weebly.com]\n* Duke Debate [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527193633/http://www.duke.edu/web/dukedebate/index.html]\n* Eastern Connecticut State University Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20110919031915/http://www.easternct.edu/studentactivities/clubs_orgs/debate.htm]\n* Fordham Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20051028215758/http://www.fordhamdebatesociety.org/]\n* Franklin and Marshall Debate Club [https://archive.today/20121210134842/http://www.fandm.edu/collegehousesystem/debate]\n* George Washington Parliamentary Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20130721201445/http://www.gwudebate.org/]\n* Hamilton College\n* [[Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society]]\n* Haverford College Debate Team [http://www.haverford.edu/organizations/debate]\n* Johns Hopkins University's Woodrow Wilson Debate Council [https://web.archive.org/web/20120615160936/http://johnshopkins.collegiatelink.net/organization/woodrowwilsondebatecouncil]\n* Loyola Marymount\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology Debate Team [http://web.mit.edu/debate/www/]\n* Middlebury Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20150408223343/https://middlebury.collegiatelink.net/organization/middleburydebatesociety]\n* Moody Bible Institute Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20150404071915/http://www.moodysdc.com/debate-society/]\n* Mount Holyoke College Debate Society [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/org/debate/]\n* NYU Parliamentary Debate Union [http://www.nyu.edu/clubs/parliamentary.debater/NYU_Debate.html]\n* Northeastern Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20141225152840/http://northeasterndebate.wordpress.com/]\n* Odette Debate Team [http://www.uwindsor.ca/odette/competitive-teams]\n* Penn Debate Society [http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/debate/index.html]\n* [[Princeton Debate Panel]] [http://debate.princeton.edu/]\n* Providence College Debate Society{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n* Quinnipiac University Parliamentary Debate Society\n* RIT Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20120403174744/http://campuslife.rit.edu/main/clubs/details?clubName=Debate%20Society&clubId=182]\n* [[Rutgers University Debate Union]] [http://debate.rutgers.edu]\n* Smith College Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20071220232046/http://sophia.smith.edu/debate/]\n* Stanford Debate Society [https://debate.stanford.edu]\n* Swarthmore College Amos J.

APDA sponsors over 50 tournaments a year, all in a parliamentary format, as well as a national championship in late April.  It also administers the [[North American Debating Championship]] with the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate]] (CUSID) every year in January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apdaweb.org/about/history |title=Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &#124; American College Debate Association - About |publisher=Apda Web |date=January 23, 1981}}</ref> Although it is mainly funded by its member universities, APDA is an entirely student-run organization.\n\n==Organizational structure==\nAPDA comprises about 80 universities, mainly in the [[U.S. Northeast|Northeast]], ranging as far north as [[Maine]] and as far south as [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apda.online/about/contacts/|title=Contacts - American Parliamentary Debate Association|author=|first=|date=2019|website=https://apda.online|access-date=March 24, 2019}}</ref> APDA includes both private and public colleges and universities.\n\nAPDA members stage weekly debating tournaments, each at a different university and occurring throughout the academic year.  Most weekends have two or three debating tournaments: at least one will be north of [[New York City]] and south of New York City, in order to shorten transport time.  However, centrally located tournaments or historically large tournaments, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Harvard University|Harvard]], will be \u201cunopposed\u201d, meaning that they will be the only tournament on that particular weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apda.online/schedule/|title=Schedule 2018-19 \u2013 American Parliamentary Debate Association|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> Individual schools must ensure that their tournaments meet a broad set of APDA guidelines,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=APDA_By-laws#Section_5.08_Tournaments|title=APDA By-laws - APDAWeb Wiki|website=history.apdaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> but are free to tinker with their tournament formats.\n\nThere are a number of tournaments in which APDA<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=APDA_By-laws#Section_3.01_Power_of_Board_and_Qualification_of_Trustees|title=Board of Trustees - APDA By-laws - APDAWeb Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=history.apdaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> plays a direct role.  Most prominently, APDA sponsors a national championship at the end of each year.  Unlike all other tournaments, debating at Nationals is limited to one team per university, plus any additional teams who \u201cqualified\u201d for Nationals during that debate season.  There are several ways to qualify for Nationals: The most common through the 2006\u20132007 season was to reach the final round of a tournament.  Starting with the 2007\u20132008 season, qualification was earned through year-long performance, gauged by how far debaters advance at tournaments of varying sizes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=APDA_By-laws#Section_5.09_National_Debate_Championship|title=APDA By-laws - APDAWeb Wiki|website=history.apdaweb.org|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, APDA sponsors a novice tournament at the beginning of the season, a pro-am tournament once per semester, and the [[North American Debating Championships]], which are held every other year in the United States and include top teams from the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\nAPDA also has a ranking system which combines the results of all of the year's tournaments.  Both individual speakers and two-member teams can earn points based on the results of the tournament; these points also scale up depending on the tournament's size.  At the end of the debate season, APDA gives awards to the top ten teams, speakers, and novices of the year.\n\nAPDA is an entirely student-run organization.  The APDA board members are students from various host institutions, and most of the tournaments are completely organized by the host school's debate team.  Some teams do have professional coaches, but these are usually recently retired debaters who wish to stay involved with the circuit.\n\n==Tournaments==\nWeekly debating tournaments are the core of APDA.  While numerous schools slightly alter the tournament format, the general format is fairly constant.  Tournaments usually start on Friday afternoon and end on Saturday evening.  Five preliminary rounds are held, three on Friday and two on Saturday. The first round is randomly paired, while remaining rounds are bracketed, meaning that teams with the same record face each other.  Preliminary rounds generally have only one judge, most frequently a debater from the host school.  After five rounds, the \u201cbreak\u201d is announced, consisting of the top eight teams at the tournament.  These teams compete in single-elimination quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, judged by progressively larger panels of judges, and a tournament winner is crowned. Separate semifinals and then finals are held on the basis of the previous five rounds for the top novice team. Trophies are awarded to the top speakers, top teams, and top novice (first-year) debaters.  Certain tournaments tinker with the format, having more or fewer preliminary rounds and larger or smaller breaks; the national championships, for instance, generally have one additional preliminary round and one additional elimination round.\n\n==Format==\nDebates at APDA tournaments follow a debating style known as American Parliamentary Debate, which is modeled loosely on the procedure and decorum of the [[UK Parliament]]. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge.\n\n===Flow of the round===\nA round of debate features two teams of two debaters each: the ''Government'' team, including the ''Prime Minister'' and the ''Member of Government'', and the ''Opposition'' team, including the ''Leader of the Opposition'' and the ''Member of the Opposition''.\n\nSix speeches in all are delivered, varying in length:\n* Prime Minister's Constructive: 7 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Leader of the Opposition's Constructive: 8 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Member of Government: 8 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Member of the Opposition: 8 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Leader of the Opposition's Rebuttal: 4 minutes, 30 seconds\n* Prime Minister's Rebuttal: 5 minutes, 30 seconds\n\n===Points of information===\nA debater may rise to ask a ''point of information'' (POI) of an opponent during the opponent's speech. POIs are only permitted during the first four speeches, though prohibited in the first and final minutes of each speech. The speaking debater can choose to hear the POI or to dismiss it politely. Traditionally when standing on a point of information some debaters extend one hand palm up, holding the back of the head with the other. This pose originated in old British Parliamentary etiquette: an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] would adopt the position to secure his wig and show that he was not carrying a weapon.<ref name=\"poi-origin\">{{cite web\n|url= https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/38/10/focus/\n|title= The rules of engagement: McGill debaters dedicated to disagreement\n|accessdate= 2006-08-01\n|last= Roberts|first= Jeff\n|date= 2006-01-26\n|publisher= McGill Reporter\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060818182047/http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/38/10/focus/| archivedate= 18 August 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\nIt is generally considered good form to accept at least one POI during a speech.\n\n===Resolutions===\nIn most rounds, there is no resolution, and the Government team may propose whatever case it wishes consistent with the standards below.  Certain tournaments provide both teams with a motion to which the case must conform 15 minutes before the round starts.\n\nSince the Opposition team arrives at the round with no prior knowledge of the case, some kinds of resolutions are not permitted to ensure a fair debate. If Opposition feels that the round fits any one of these categories, they may point this out during the Leader's speech. If the judge agrees, Opposition wins. There are five kinds of disallowed resolutions:\n* ''tight'' resolutions, which are deemed too one-sided (\u201c[[racism]] is bad\u201d, for example);\n* [[truism]]s (\u201cBarack Obama was the greatest Democratic president of the U.S. since Bill Clinton\u201d);\n* [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] (\u201cGood citizens should help the poor,\u201d with goodness defined as \"a willingness to do charitable acts\");\n* [[status quo]] resolutions (\u201cThe [[United States of America|United States]] should have [[jury trial]]s\u201d);\n* ''specific-knowledge'' cases, i.e., cases which are unfair toward the Opposition team because they require highly obscure knowledge to oppose effectively (\"NASA should replace the current sealant used on the space shuttle with hypoxynucleotide-C4598\")\n\nAside from these five limitations, virtually any topic for debate is fair game, as long as there are two coherent and debatable sides.  Debaters may also present ''opp-choice'' cases, in which the government team offers the opposition team the chance to choose which side of a topic the government team will defend in the round.\n\n===Adjudication===\nA judge listens to the round and provides quantitative and qualitative assessments of the round as a whole and of the individual speakers. Some rounds use a panel of judges. Judges are usually debaters themselves, but non-debater judges, or ''lay judges'', are sometimes used.\n\n===Comparison to other styles===\nThe APDA style is generally seen as occupying a middle ground between the styles of\nCUSID and [[National Parliamentary Debate Association|NPDA]].  It is somewhat more rule-oriented and structured than the CUSID style, as point-by-point argumentation and careful structure are considered very important.  It also emphasizes detailed analysis and de-emphasizes oratory as compared to CUSID. However, APDA style is less structured and theoretical than the [[National Parliamentary Debate Association|NPDA]] style, and demands less use of technical debate formalisms.\n\n==Types of cases==\nAPDA's format allows for an enormous variety of cases.  This list is ''not'' comprehensive, but should be treated as a general sketch of the case climate.\n\n===Public policy===\nCases about public policy are among the most common cases on APDA.  They include common public policy debates ([[education voucher|school vouchers]], [[term limit]]s, [[euthanasia]], [[capital punishment]], race-based [[affirmative action]]) as well as more unconventional ideas (mandatory [[organ donation]], [[proxy voting]] for children, private criminal prosecution, and innumerable others). [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] policy proposals, such as abolishing the [[minimum wage]] or abolishing [[Paternalism|paternalistic laws]], are particularly popular.  Cases involving the policies of particular organizations are popular as well, such as debates surrounding university speech codes.  Additionally, broad social questions can be discussed without centering the case around a government actor; \u201cAre [[trade unions]], all things considered, a good thing for society?\u201d is a perfectly acceptable opp-choice debate case.\n\n===Political theory===\nAbstract questions about political philosophy are also popular topics of debate.\nCases about the relative benefits of the [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] \u201c[[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]]\u201d versus the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] \u201c[[state of nature]]\u201d, for instance, are commonplace.  These rounds will generally be folded into moral hypotheticals; for instance, rather than a team actually proposing that the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] is a worthwhile political theory, a team might argue that economic human rights should be included in constitutions, and use the veil of ignorance as a justification.\n\n===Law and legal theory===\nAll aspects of law are fair game on APDA, including constitutional law (e.g. whether a Supreme Court case was wrongly decided), procedural law (e.g. whether standards of proof should differ for criminal and civil law) and abstract legal theory (e.g. whether [[retributive justice]] is a moral justification for the [[criminal justice]] system).\n\n===Foreign policy===\nMany aspects of American and international foreign policy make for excellent debate rounds.  Various aspects of policy related to [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[North Korea]], and [[Cuba]] are frequent debate topics.\n\n===Moral hypotheticals===\nHypothetical moral dilemmas are popular topics for debate, given that they can be discussed with a minimum of specific knowledge and a maximum of argumentation.  They can range from completely fantastical situations (\u201cIf you had definitive proof that one particular [[religion]] was the true [[religion]], should you reveal it to society?\u201d) to unlikely occurrences (\u201cShould you kill one person to save five other people?\u201d) to dilemmas we face every day (\u201cYou see a [[homelessness|homeless]] person on the street, should you give him money you have in your pocket?\u201d)  The infinite number of hypothetical situations that can give rise to moral dilemmas make many moral hypothetical cases unique.\n\n=== Abstract philosophy ===\nAlthough somewhat less common than tangible moral hypotheticals, all aspects of philosophy make their way into debate rounds.  Ethics is probably the most debated field of philosophy, including both abstract [[metaethics]] and modern ethical problems like the [[trolley problem]].  However, [[philosophy of religion]] (\u201cIs it rational to be an [[atheism|atheist]]?\u201d), [[philosophy of mind]] (\u201cCan a computer have mental states?\u201d) and even [[philosophy of language]] (\u201cDoes love result from appreciation of someone\u2019s properties, or does appreciation of someone\u2019s properties result from love?\u201d) can result in excellent rounds.\n\n=== Time-space ===\nOne type of case, common on APDA but rare on other circuits, is the time-space case.  This places the speaker in the position of some real-life, fictional, or historical figure.  Only information accessible to a person in that position is legal in this type of round.  For instance, \u201cYou are [[Socrates]].  Don\u2019t commit suicide\u201d could not reference events that took place after [[Socrates]]\u2019 death.  The speaker can be a fictional character (\u201cYou are [[Homer Simpson]].  Do not sell your soul\u201d), a historical character (\u201cYou are [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Do not sign the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation proclamation]]\u201d) or virtually any other sentient individual.\n\nOne notable type of time-space case is the historical hypothetical case, in which decisions made by particular historical figures are debated from their historical context.  Debates surrounding, for instance, [[American Civil War|Civil War]] strategy or [[World War I]] alliances are commonplace.  These types of debates often require a detailed knowledge of history.\n\nTime-space cases are a particularly sensitive type of case for the government, because their setting must leave room for the opposition to defeat the case even if that would go against the historical outcome already known to everyone in the room.\n\n=== Comedy cases ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nTeams occasionally choose to debate very funny or silly topics in rounds.  In this case, the round often becomes a contest over wit and style rather than pure analysis.  \u201c[[Disneyland]] should [[secession|secede]] from the United States\u201d or something like the following:\n\n\u201cThe Federal [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|SNAP]] program should be replaced with a National Buffet Program where those members of the new improved program shall be granted full and unfettered access to a nationwide chain of all you can eat buffets (with post-meal resting areas) that they may access via a new government issued \"buffet\" card to promote consumption of prodigious amounts of food and the free and easy movement of cardholders throughout the land.\" This case was actually proposed, and victorious in the final round of the 1993 University of Pennsylvania Tournament. This is an example of this type of round, which have been known to get quite bizarre.\n\nNumerous cases are run on APDA that do not fit into any of the categories; case construction is a skill that requires significant creativity, and coming up with unique debate topics is a very important skill on the APDA circuit.\n\n== History ==\nWhile parliamentary debate had been popular in America for some time, there was no proper organization that existed to schedule tournaments, officiate a national championship or resolve disputes. The result was a bizarrely ordered chaos. Following the Glasgow World Championship in 1981, APDA was founded.<ref name=\"The Founding of APDA\">{{cite web|title=The Founding of APDA|url=http://history.apdaweb.org/dir/index.php?title=The_Founding_of_APDA|publisher=APDA|access-date=21 November 2013}}</ref> It has dramatically grown in size since then.

Gertler and Tom Massaro\n\n===Evolutionary changes===\nAmerican parliamentary debate did not begin with APDA.  Three circuits operated in the U.S. prior to its creation, in the Northeast, Midwest, and California.  The [[University of Chicago]] tournament was considered the ''de facto'' national championship due to its central location and its place as the last tournament on the calendar, and was selected to host the first APDA Nationals in 1981.  APDA started as a way to coordinate tournament schedules among the Northeast schools and to provide a single point of contact for what was then a close working relationship with [[CUSID]].<ref name=\"The Founding of APDA\"/>\n\nTournaments were either five or six rounds, and the length of speeches slightly different from today, at 8, 8, 8, 12, and 4 minutes.  The 12-minute speech by the Opposition could be divided into 8 and 4, in which case the Leader of the Opposition took the Opposition's first 8-minute speech, the Member of the Opposition the second 8, and the leader finished with 4 minutes of pure rebuttal.  The decision on whether to split was tactical, as a strong 12-minute speech could be hard for the Prime Minister to rebut in 4, but a poor one could be disastrous.  Often, the decision to split was made after the Prime Minister's opening speech, when the Opposition had some notion of the strength of the Government case.\n\nPre- and early-APDA debate style was much closer to CUSID style, with the government required to debate the resolution provided by the tournament organizers. Teams could be creative in using alternative or pun-based definitions for common words used in the original resolution. This was what was originally meant by \"squirreling\" the resolution. A government could choose to debate \"The U.S. should pull out\" seriously by defining what the U.S. should pull out of\u2014a foreign entanglement or the [[United Nations]], for example.  It could be squirreled by choosing an uncommon phrase abbreviated U.S. -- the \"usual seatbelt\" would make it a case against [[airbag]]s or other passive restraint systems in cars.  Further value was placed on analyzing the underlying core assumptions of a case; in the \"usual seatbelt\" example, the assumption was that safety should be an individual's personal choice rather than mandated by government.  The best teams were able to argue both the specific case and the general philosophical point.  Cases that seemed to be prepared in advance and linked awkwardly to the resolution were strongly discouraged, and judges were trained to deduct points accordingly.\n\nBy about 1987, several factors had led debates to cease relating directly to the resolutions.  Among these were APDA's increasing popularity with debaters accustomed to high school on-topic ([[National Forensic League|NFL]] or [http://cedadebate.org/ CEDA]) formats, a notable incidence of poorly written resolutions that were hard to debate even when squirreled, and the fact that at many schools, the supply of judges willing to sit through training sessions on the fine points of parliamentary style was not sufficient for increasingly larger tournaments.  The result was a rise in prepared cases, a greater emphasis on policy prescriptions and specifics, less-strict adherence to the rules and customs of Parliament, and less opportunity for broad philosophical debate.\n\nWhile the content of debate rounds has changed significantly, the spirit of today's APDA tournaments is very similar to the original ones, as friendly rivals renew acquaintance every week during the season.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Member organizations===\n{{colbegin}}\n* American University Debate Society<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audebate.org|title=American University Debate Society - The premier debating society of American University.|author=|date=|website=AUDebate.org|access-date=May 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517074628/http://audebate.org/|archive-date=May 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Amherst Debate Society<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/campuslife/studentgroups/debate_society|title=Debate Society - Home|website=Amherst.edu|access-date=May 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413025422/https://www.amherst.edu/campuslife/studentgroups/debate_society/|archive-date=April 13, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Bates Brooks-Quimby Debate Council<ref>[http://batesdebate.org]</ref>\n* [[Boston University Debate Society]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425191806/http://people.bu.edu/budebate/]\n* Brandeis Academic Debate And Speech Society (BADASS) [http://debate.brandeis.edu/]\n* [[Brown Debating Union]] [http://browndebate.org/]\n* Bryn Mawr Parliamentary Debate Society\n* Catholic University\tof America Debate Society [http://cua.campusgroups.com/debate/about/]\n* Columbia Debate Society [http://www.columbiadebate.com/]\n* Cornell Debate Association [http://sao.cornell.edu/SO/org/11-12/304]\n* Dartmouth College Parliamentary Debate Team [http://dartmouthparlidebate.blogspot.com/]\n* DePaul Debate Society [http://depauldebate.weebly.com]\n* Duke Debate [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527193633/http://www.duke.edu/web/dukedebate/index.html]\n* Eastern Connecticut State University Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20110919031915/http://www.easternct.edu/studentactivities/clubs_orgs/debate.htm]\n* Fordham Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20051028215758/http://www.fordhamdebatesociety.org/]\n* Franklin and Marshall Debate Club [https://archive.today/20121210134842/http://www.fandm.edu/collegehousesystem/debate]\n* George Washington Parliamentary Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20130721201445/http://www.gwudebate.org/]\n* Hamilton College\n* [[Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society]]\n* Haverford College Debate Team [http://www.haverford.edu/organizations/debate]\n* Johns Hopkins University's Woodrow Wilson Debate Council [https://web.archive.org/web/20120615160936/http://johnshopkins.collegiatelink.net/organization/woodrowwilsondebatecouncil]\n* Loyola Marymount\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology Debate Team [http://web.mit.edu/debate/www/]\n* Middlebury Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20150408223343/https://middlebury.collegiatelink.net/organization/middleburydebatesociety]\n* Moody Bible Institute Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20150404071915/http://www.moodysdc.com/debate-society/]\n* Mount Holyoke College Debate Society [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/org/debate/]\n* NYU Parliamentary Debate Union [http://www.nyu.edu/clubs/parliamentary.debater/NYU_Debate.html]\n* Northeastern Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20141225152840/http://northeasterndebate.wordpress.com/]\n* Odette Debate Team [http://www.uwindsor.ca/odette/competitive-teams]\n* Penn Debate Society [http://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/debate/index.html]\n* [[Princeton Debate Panel]] [http://debate.princeton.edu/]\n* Providence College Debate Society{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n* Quinnipiac University Parliamentary Debate Society\n* RIT Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20120403174744/http://campuslife.rit.edu/main/clubs/details?clubName=Debate%20Society&clubId=182]\n* [[Rutgers University Debate Union]] [http://debate.rutgers.edu]\n* Smith College Debate Society [https://web.archive.org/web/20071220232046/http://sophia.smith.edu/debate/]\n* Stanford Debate Society [https://debate.stanford.edu]\n* Swarthmore College Amos J.

It was founded in 1980 primarily by [[Great Britain|British]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Journalism|journalist]] and [[author]] Derek Humphry, his late wife Ann Wickett Humphry, [[Canada|Canadian]] former [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]-turned-[[Religious skepticism|skeptic]] [[Gerald A.

In 2003, the national organization renamed itself End of Life Choices. They later merged with the Compassion in Dying Federation to become [[Compassion & Choices]].<ref>[https://www.compassionandchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FS-History-of-the-End-of-Life-Choice-Movement-FINAL-1.9.18-Approved-for-Public-Distribution.pdf History of the End-of-Life Choice Movement]</ref> (.PDF)  Before the merger, Derek Humphry, Faye Girsh, and others founded the Final Exit Network.  Where Compassion & Choices' focus is on legislative reform and advocating for and law change, the Final Exit Network concerns itself with what it believes to be the immediate issue of self-deliverance.\n\n==Exit guides==\n\nTypically, clients' only person-to-person contact with the Final Exit Network is through \"exit guides\", who are volunteers assigned by case coordinators to meet with clients and attend the death events.<ref name=\"hometownsource.com\">[https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_thisweek/final-exit-network-founder-sees-charges-dismissed/article_faaaeca3-9a0a-54d5-ac34-87b9faa4965e.html Final Exit Network founder sees charges dismissed]</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29411514/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/assisted-suicide-group-members-are-arrested/#.WnWMb4JG1E4 Helium, hoods used by assisted suicide group]</ref>\n\n{{as of|2016}}, the Network had about 30 guides. Guides provide services including companionship during death, education, advice regarding the discovery of remains and facilitation of conversations with friends and family. Before an applicant is approved for the Final Exit Network's services, a guide visits the applicant's home and conducts an interview with her or him and any family involved to assess if a voluntary and informed choice has been made by the applicant regarding self-deliverance.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/the-volunteers-who-help-people-end-their-own-lives/489602/ The Volunteers Who Help People End Their Own Lives]</ref>\n\nIn the Minnesota case of Doreen Dunn, the attendant exit guides were determined by the state to have removed the equipment with which she had ended her life.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-to-die-group-convicted-of-assisting-minnesota-suicide/ Right-to-die group convicted of assisting Minnesota suicide]</ref>\n\n==Notable legal cases==\nThe Final Exit Network and several members have been defendants in three notable prosecutions: the April 12, 2007 death of Jana Van Voorhis of Phoenix, Arizona; the May 30, 2007 death of Doreen Dunn of Apple Valley, Minnesota; and the June 20, 2008 death of John Celmer of Cumming, Georgia.\n\n===Jana Van Voorhis===\nJana Van Voorhis was a 58-year-old [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] woman with a history of mental illness whose suicide was allegedly assisted by the Final Exit Network in 2007.<ref>Bethea, Charles, \"Death's Escorts: The Final Exit Network, and what they leave behind,\" March 2010</ref>  She falsely claimed to have a myriad of physical diseases and expressed a belief that she may have had [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/nov/08/frontline-suicide-plan/ |title=FRONTLINE: The Suicide Plan |publisher=PBS |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> Two members of the Final Exit Network were charged with aiding in a suicide (which is considered [[manslaughter]] under Arizona law) and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit manslaughter.

Four members: then-medical director Dr. Lawrence Egbert, then-case coordinator Roberta Massey, and exit guides Ted Goodwin and Jerry Dincin (Goodwin's successor as president) were also charged individually in the 17-count [[indictment]], which included felony counts of assisting in a suicide and gross [[misdemeanor]]s of interfering with a death scene.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Karen Asphaug dismissed all charges against Ted Goodwin on March 22, 2013 on grounds that the allegations against him did not constitute a crime. He was the president of Final Exit Network at the time of the Dunn death but was not alleged to have done anything to implicate him in any crime.

In fact, there was no evidence at trial that any Final Exit Network volunteer assisted in Dunn's death or provided the means. Dr. Egbert testified that they did not. \n\nAlthough there was a Minnesota [[statute]] in effect at the time of Dunn's death which prohibited \"advising, encouraging, or assisting\" in a \"suicide\",<ref>[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mn-supreme-court/1660689.html State v.

In 2003, the national organization renamed itself End of Life Choices. They later merged with the Compassion in Dying Federation to become [[Compassion & Choices]].<ref>[https://www.compassionandchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/FS-History-of-the-End-of-Life-Choice-Movement-FINAL-1.9.18-Approved-for-Public-Distribution.pdf History of the End-of-Life Choice Movement]</ref> (.PDF)  Before the merger, Derek Humphry, Faye Girsh, and others founded the Final Exit Network.  Where Compassion & Choices' focus is on legislative reform and advocating for and law change, the Final Exit Network concerns itself with what it believes to be the immediate issue of self-deliverance.\n\n==Exit guides==\n\nTypically, clients' only person-to-person contact with the Final Exit Network is through \"exit guides\", who are volunteers assigned by case coordinators to meet with clients and attend the death events.<ref name=\"hometownsource.com\">[https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_thisweek/final-exit-network-founder-sees-charges-dismissed/article_faaaeca3-9a0a-54d5-ac34-87b9faa4965e.html Final Exit Network founder sees charges dismissed]</ref><ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29411514/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/assisted-suicide-group-members-are-arrested/#.WnWMb4JG1E4 Helium, hoods used by assisted suicide group]</ref>\n\n{{as of|2016}}, the Network had about 30 guides. Guides provide services including companionship during death, education, advice regarding the discovery of remains and facilitation of conversations with friends and family. Before an applicant is approved for the Final Exit Network's services, a guide visits the applicant's home and conducts an interview with her or him and any family involved to assess if a voluntary and informed choice has been made by the applicant regarding self-deliverance.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/the-volunteers-who-help-people-end-their-own-lives/489602/ The Volunteers Who Help People End Their Own Lives]</ref>\n\nIn the Minnesota case of Doreen Dunn, the attendant exit guides were determined by the state to have removed the equipment with which she had ended her life.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/right-to-die-group-convicted-of-assisting-minnesota-suicide/ Right-to-die group convicted of assisting Minnesota suicide]</ref>\n\n==Notable legal cases==\nThe Final Exit Network and several members have been defendants in three notable prosecutions: the April 12, 2007 death of Jana Van Voorhis of Phoenix, Arizona; the May 30, 2007 death of Doreen Dunn of Apple Valley, Minnesota; and the June 20, 2008 death of John Celmer of Cumming, Georgia.\n\n===Jana Van Voorhis===\nJana Van Voorhis was a 58-year-old [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] woman with a history of mental illness whose suicide was allegedly assisted by the Final Exit Network in 2007.<ref>Bethea, Charles, \"Death's Escorts: The Final Exit Network, and what they leave behind,\" March 2010</ref>  She falsely claimed to have a myriad of physical diseases and expressed a belief that she may have had [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/nov/08/frontline-suicide-plan/ |title=FRONTLINE: The Suicide Plan |publisher=PBS |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> Two members of the Final Exit Network were charged with aiding in a suicide (which is considered [[manslaughter]] under Arizona law) and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit manslaughter.

Four members: then-medical director Dr. Lawrence Egbert, then-case coordinator Roberta Massey, and exit guides Ted Goodwin and Jerry Dincin (Goodwin's successor as president) were also charged individually in the 17-count [[indictment]], which included felony counts of assisting in a suicide and gross [[misdemeanor]]s of interfering with a death scene.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Karen Asphaug dismissed all charges against Ted Goodwin on March 22, 2013 on grounds that the allegations against him did not constitute a crime. He was the president of Final Exit Network at the time of the Dunn death but was not alleged to have done anything to implicate him in any crime.

In fact, there was no evidence at trial that any Final Exit Network volunteer assisted in Dunn's death or provided the means. Dr. Egbert testified that they did not. \n\nAlthough there was a Minnesota [[statute]] in effect at the time of Dunn's death which prohibited \"advising, encouraging, or assisting\" in a \"suicide\",<ref>[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mn-supreme-court/1660689.html State v.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the [[expressionism|expressionist movement]] in German poetry and art, and leader of the [[Second Viennese School]]. With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], Schoenberg's works were labeled [[degenerate music]], because they were modernist and atonal. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941.\n\nSchoenberg's approach, b\u03bfth in terms of harmony and development, has been one of the most influential of 20th-century musical thought. Many European and American composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking, whereas others have passionately reacted against it.\n\nSchoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] styles of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in [[atonality]] (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the [[twelve-tone technique]], an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered [[tone row|series]] of all twelve notes in the [[chromatic scale]]. He also coined the term [[developing variation]] and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing [[Motif (music)|motifs]] without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\n\nSchoenberg was also an influential teacher of composition; his students included [[Alban Berg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Egon Wellesz]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Stefania Turkewich]], and later [[John Cage]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Earl Kim]], [[Robert Gerhard]], [[Leon Kirchner]], [[Dika Newlin]], and [[List of music students by teacher: R to S#Arnold Schoenberg|other prominent musicians]]. Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in [[avant-garde]] musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many significant 20th-century musicologists and critics, including [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Charles Rosen]], and [[Carl Dahlhaus]], as well as the pianists [[Artur Schnabel]], [[Rudolf Serkin]], [[Eduard Steuermann]], and [[Glenn Gould]].\n\nSchoenberg's archival legacy is collected at the [[Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg Center]] in Vienna.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schoenberg 1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg in Payerbach, 1903]]\nArnold Schoenberg was born into a lower middle-class Jewish family in the [[Leopoldstadt]] district (in earlier times a Jewish [[ghetto]]) of Vienna, at \"Obere Donaustra\u00dfe 5\". His father Samuel, a native of Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]]), was a shoe-[[shopkeeper]], and his mother Pauline Schoenberg (n\u00e9e Nachod), a native of [[Prague]], was a piano teacher {{harv|Helm|2006\u20132017}}. Arnold was largely self-taught. He took only [[counterpoint]] lessons with the composer [[Alexander Zemlinsky]], who was to become his first brother-in-law {{harv|Beaumont|2000|loc=87}}.\n\nIn his twenties, Schoenberg earned a living by orchestrating [[operetta]]s, while composing his own works, such as the string sextet ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' (\"Transfigured Night\") (1899). He later made an orchestral version of this, which became one of his most popular pieces. Both [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] recognized Schoenberg's significance as a composer; Strauss when he encountered Schoenberg's ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'', and Mahler after hearing several of Schoenberg's early works.\n\nStrauss turned to a more conservative idiom in his own work after 1909, and at that point dismissed Schoenberg. Mahler adopted him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and continued to support him, even after Schoenberg's style reached a point Mahler could no longer understand. Mahler worried about who would look after him after his death {{harv|Boss|2013|loc=118}}. Schoenberg, who had initially despised and mocked Mahler's music, was converted by the \"thunderbolt\" of Mahler's ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]]'', which he considered a work of genius. Afterward he \"spoke of Mahler as a saint\" ({{harvnb|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=103}}; {{harvnb|Schoenberg|1975|loc=136}}).\n\nIn 1898 Schoenberg converted to Christianity in the [[Lutheran]] church. According to MacDonald (2008, 93) this was partly to strengthen his attachment to Western European cultural traditions, and partly as a means of self-defence \"in a time of resurgent anti-Semitism\". In 1933, after long meditation, he returned to Judaism, because he realised that \"his racial and religious heritage was inescapable\", and to take up an unmistakable position on the side opposing Nazism. He would self-identify as a member of the Jewish religion later in life {{harv|Marquis Who's Who|n.d.}}.\n\n===1901\u20131914: experimenting in atonality===\n[[File:Gerstl - Die Familie Sch\u00f6nberg.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Sch\u00f6nberg Family]]'', a painting by [[Richard Gerstl]], 1907]]\nIn October 1901, Schoenberg married Mathilde Zemlinsky, the sister of the conductor and composer [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], with whom Schoenberg had been studying since about 1894. Schoenberg and Mathilde had two children, Gertrud (1902\u20131947) and Georg (1906\u20131974). Gertrud would marry Schoenberg's pupil Felix Greissle in 1921 {{harv|Neighbour|2001}}.\n\nDuring the summer of 1908, Schoenberg's wife Mathilde left him for several months for a young Austrian painter, [[Richard Gerstl]] (who committed suicide in that November after Mathilde returned to her marriage). This period marked a distinct change in Schoenberg's work. It was during the absence of his wife that he composed \"You lean against a silver-willow\" ({{lang-de|link=no|Du lehnest wider eine Silberweide}}), the thirteenth song in the cycle ''[[The Book of the Hanging Gardens|Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten]]'', Op.&nbsp;15, based on the collection of the same name by the German mystical poet [[Stefan George]]. This was the first composition without any reference at all to a key {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=96}}.\n\nAlso in this year, Schoenberg completed one of his most revolutionary compositions, the [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|String Quartet No.&nbsp;2]]. The first two movements, though chromatic in color, use traditional key signatures. The final two movements, again using poetry by George, incorporate a soprano vocal line, breaking with previous string-quartet practice, and daringly weaken the links with traditional tonality. Both movements end on tonic chords, and the work is not fully non-tonal.\n\nDuring the summer of 1910, Schoenberg wrote his [https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28creator%3A%22Arnold%20Sch%C3%B6nberg%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Arnold%20Schoenberg%22%29%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts%20NOT%20Goethe ''Harmonielehre''] (''Theory of Harmony'', Schoenberg 1922), which remains one of the most influential music-theory books. From about 1911, Schoenberg belonged to a circle of artists and intellectuals who included [[Lene Schneider-Kainer]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Herwarth Walden]], and [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]].\n\nIn 1910 he met [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]], an English music journalist then working in Germany. Clark became his sole English student, and in his later capacity as a producer for the BBC he was responsible for introducing many of Schoenberg's works, and Schoenberg himself, to Britain (as well as [[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]] and others).\n\nAnother of his most important works from this atonal or pantonal period is the highly influential ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', Op.&nbsp;21, of 1912, a novel cycle of expressionist songs set to a German translation of poems by the Belgian-French poet [[Albert Giraud]]. Utilizing the technique of ''[[Sprechstimme]]'', or melodramatically spoken recitation, the work pairs a female vocalist with a small ensemble of five musicians. The ensemble, which is now commonly referred to as the [[Pierrot ensemble]], consists of [[flute]] (doubling on [[piccolo]]), [[clarinet]] (doubling on [[bass clarinet]]), violin (doubling on [[viola]]), violoncello, speaker, and piano.\n\nWilhelm Bopp, director of the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]] from 1907, wanted a break from the stale environment personified for him by [[Robert Fuchs]] and [[Hermann Graedener]]. Having considered many candidates, he offered teaching positions to Schoenberg and [[Franz Schreker]] in 1912. At the time Schoenberg lived in Berlin. He was not completely cut off from the Vienna Conservatory, having taught a private theory course a year earlier. He seriously considered the offer, but he declined. Writing afterward to Alban Berg, he cited his \"aversion to Vienna\" as the main reason for his decision, while contemplating that it might have been the wrong one financially, but having made it he felt content. A couple of months later he wrote to Schreker suggesting that it might have been a bad idea for him as well to accept the teaching position {{harv|Hailey|1993|loc=55\u201357}}.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg. 1917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arnold Schoenberg by [[Egon Schiele]], 1917]]\n[[World War I]] brought a crisis in his development. Military service disrupted his life when at the age of 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped \"beginnings\". On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was \"this notorious Schoenberg, then\"; Schoenberg replied: \"Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so I let it be me\" {{harv|Schoenberg|1975|loc=104}} (according to [[Norman Lebrecht|Norman]] {{harvtxt|Lebrecht|2001}}, this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent \"destiny\" as the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|\"Emancipator of Dissonance\"]]).\n\nIn what [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] calls an \"act of war psychosis\", Schoenberg drew comparisons between Germany's assault on France and his assault on decadent bourgeois artistic values. In August 1914, while denouncing the music of [[Bizet]], [[Stravinsky]], and [[Ravel]], he wrote: \"Now comes the reckoning! Now we will throw these mediocre kitschmongers into slavery, and teach them to venerate the German spirit and to worship the German God\" {{harv|Ross|2007|loc=60}}.\n\nThe deteriorating relation between contemporary composers and the public led him to found the [[Society for Private Musical Performances]] (''Verein f\u00fcr musikalische Privatauff\u00fchrungen'' in German) in Vienna in 1918. He sought to provide a forum in which modern musical compositions could be carefully prepared and rehearsed, and properly performed under conditions protected from the dictates of fashion and pressures of commerce. From its inception through 1921, when it ended because of economic reasons, the Society presented 353 performances to paid members, sometimes at the rate of one per week. During the first year and a half, Schoenberg did not let any of his own works be performed {{harv|Rosen|1975|loc=65}}. Instead, audiences at the Society's concerts heard difficult contemporary compositions by [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], Mahler, Webern, Berg, [[Max Reger|Reger]], and other leading figures of early 20th-century music {{harv|Rosen|1996|loc=66}}.\n\n===Development of the twelve-tone method===\n[[File:Arnold sch\u00f6nberg man ray.jpg|thumb|upright|Arnold Schoenberg, 1927, by [[Man Ray]]]]\nLater, Schoenberg was to develop the most influential version of the dodecaphonic (also known as [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]]) method of composition, which in French and English was given the alternative name [[serialism]] by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]] and [[Humphrey Searle]] in 1947. This technique was taken up by many of his students, who constituted the so-called [[Second Viennese School]]. They included [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], and [[Hanns Eisler]], all of whom were profoundly influenced by Schoenberg. He published a number of books, ranging from his famous [https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28creator%3A%22Arnold%20Sch%C3%B6nberg%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Arnold%20Schoenberg%22%29%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts%20NOT%20Goethe ''Harmonielehre''] (Theory of Harmony) to ''Fundamentals of Musical Composition'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1967}}, many of which are still in print and used by musicians and developing composers.\n\nSchoenberg viewed his development as a natural progression, and he did not deprecate his earlier works when he ventured into serialism. In 1923 he wrote to the Swiss philanthropist [[Werner Reinhart]]:\n\n<blockquote>For the  present, it matters more to me if people understand my older works ... They are the natural forerunners of my later works, and only those who understand and comprehend these will be able to gain an understanding of the later works that goes beyond a fashionable bare minimum. I do not attach so much importance to being a musical bogey-man as to being a natural continuer of properly-understood good old tradition! ({{harvnb|Stein|1987|loc=100}}; quoted in {{harvnb|Strimple|2005|loc=22}})</blockquote>\n\nHis first wife died in October 1923, and in August of the next year Schoenberg married [[Gertrud Schoenberg|Gertrud Kolisch]] (1898\u20131967), sister of his pupil, the violinist [[Rudolf Kolisch]] ({{harvnb|Neighbour|2001}}; {{harvnb|Silverman|2010|loc=223}}). They had three children: Nuria Dorothea (born 1932), Ronald Rudolf (born 1937), and Lawrence Adam (born 1941). Gertrude Kolisch Schoenberg wrote the libretto for Schoenberg's one-act opera ''[[Von heute auf morgen]]'' under the pseudonym Max Blonda. At her request Schoenberg's (ultimately unfinished) piece, ''[[Die Jakobsleiter]]'' was prepared for performance by Schoenberg's student [[Winfried Zillig]]. After her husband's death in 1951 she founded Belmont Music Publishers devoted to the publication of his works {{harv|Shoaf|1992|loc=64}}. Arnold used the notes G and E{{music|b}} (German: Es, i.e., \"S\") for \"Gertrud Schoenberg\", in the ''Suite'', for septet, Op.&nbsp;29 (1925) {{harv|MacDonald|2008|loc=216}} (see [[musical cryptogram]]).\n\nFollowing the death in 1924 of composer [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who had served as Director of a Master Class in Composition at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] in Berlin, Schoenberg was appointed to this post the next year, but because of health problems was unable to take up his post until 1926. Among his notable students during this period were the composers Robert Gerhard, Nikos Skalkottas, and [[Josef Rufer]].\n\nAlong with his twelve-tone works, 1930 marks Schoenberg's return to tonality, with numbers 4 and 6 of the Six Pieces for Male Chorus Op.&nbsp;35, the other pieces being dodecaphonic {{harv|Auner|1999|loc=85}}.\n\n===Third Reich and move to the United States===\nSchoenberg continued in his post until the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power under [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933. While vacationing in France, he was warned that returning to Germany would be dangerous. Schoenberg formally reclaimed membership in the Jewish religion at a Paris synagogue, then traveled with his family to the United States {{harv|Friedrich|1986|loc=31}}. This happened, however, only after his attempts to move to Britain came to nothing. He enlisted the aid of his former student and great champion [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]], a senior producer with the BBC, in helping him gain a British teaching post or even a British publisher, but to no avail.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nHis first teaching position in the United States was at the [[Malkin Conservatory]] in Boston. He moved to Los Angeles, where he taught at the [[University of Southern California]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], both of which later named a music building on their respective campuses Schoenberg Hall ({{harvnb|UCLA Department of Music|[2008]}}; {{harvnb|University of Southern California Thornton School of Music|[2008]}}). He was appointed visiting professor at UCLA in 1935 on the recommendation of [[Otto Klemperer]], music director and conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and the next year was promoted to professor at a salary of $5,100 per year, which enabled him in either May 1936 or 1937 to buy a Spanish Revival house at 116 North Rockingham in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood Park]], near the UCLA campus, for $18,000. This address was directly across the street from [[Shirley Temple]]'s house, and there he befriended fellow composer (and tennis partner) [[George Gershwin]]. The Schoenbergs were able to employ domestic help and began holding Sunday afternoon gatherings that were known for excellent coffee and Viennese pastries. Frequent guests included [[Otto Klemperer]] (who studied composition privately with Schoenberg beginning in April 1936), [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], Joseph Achron, [[Louis Gruenberg]], [[Ernst Toch]], and, on occasion, well-known actors such as [[Harpo Marx]] and [[Peter Lorre]] ({{harvnb|Crawford|2009|loc=116}}; {{harvnb|Feisst|2011|loc=6}}; {{harvnb|Laskin|2008}}; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2008|loc=79}}; {{harvnb|Schoenberg|1975|loc=514}}; {{harvnb|Starr|1997|loc=383}}; {{harvnb|Watkins|2010|loc=114}}). Composers [[Leonard Rosenman]] and [[George Tremblay]] and the Hollywood orchestrator [[Edward B. Powell]] studied with Schoenberg at this time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter his move to the United States, where he arrived on 31 October 1933 {{harv|Slonimsky, Kuhn, and McIntire|2001}}, the composer used the alternative spelling of his surname ''Schoenberg'', rather than ''Sch\u00f6nberg'', in what he called \"deference to American practice\" {{harv|Foss|1951|loc=401}}, though according to one writer he first made the change a year earlier {{harv|Ross|2007|loc=45}}.\n\nHe lived there the rest of his life, but at first he was not settled. In around 1934, he applied for a position of teacher of harmony and theory at the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales State Conservatorium]] in Sydney. The Director, [[Edgar Bainton]], rejected him for being Jewish and for having \"modernist ideas and dangerous tendencies.\" Schoenberg also at one time explored the idea of emigrating to [[New Zealand]]. His secretary and student (and nephew of Schoenberg's mother-in-law Henriette Kolisch), was Richard (Dick) Hoffmann Jr, Viennese-born but who lived in New Zealand in 1935\u20131947, and Schoenberg had since childhood been fascinated with islands, and with New Zealand in particular, possibly because of the beauty of the postage stamps issued by that country {{harv|Plush|1996}}.\n\n[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising - 10501.jpg|thumb| [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. In 1947 Schoenberg wrote ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'' in commemoration of this event.]]\n\nDuring this final period, he composed several notable works, including the difficult [[Violin Concerto (Schoenberg)|Violin Concerto]], Op.&nbsp;36 (1934/36), the ''[[Kol Nidre#Inspiration for other musical pieces|Kol Nidre]]'', Op.&nbsp;39, for chorus and orchestra (1938), the ''Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte'', Op.&nbsp;41 (1942), the haunting [[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]], Op.&nbsp;42 (1942), and his memorial to the victims of the [[Holocaust]], ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', Op.&nbsp;46 (1947). He was unable to complete his opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' (1932/33), which was one of the first works of its genre written completely using [[Twelve-tone technique|dodecaphonic composition]]. Along with twelve-tone music, Schoenberg also returned to tonality with works during his last period, like the Suite for Strings in G major (1935), the [[Chamber Symphony No. 2 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 2]] in E{{music|flat}} minor, Op.&nbsp;38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939), the Variations on a Recitative in D minor, Op.&nbsp;40 (1941). During this period his notable students included [[John Cage]] and [[Lou Harrison]].\n\nIn 1941, he became a citizen of the United States {{harv|Marcus|2016|loc=188}}. Here he was the first composer in residence at the [[Music Academy of the West]] summer conservatory {{harv|Greenberg|2019}}.\n\n=== Superstition and death ===\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Schoenberg.JPG|thumb|Schoenberg's grave in the [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna]]\nSchoenberg's superstitious nature may have triggered his death. The composer had [[triskaidekaphobia]] (the fear of the number 13), and according to friend Katia Mann, he feared he would die during a year that was a multiple of 13 (quoted in {{harvnb|Lebrecht|1985|loc=294}}). This possibly began in 1908 with the composition of the thirteenth song of the song cycle ''[[The Book of the Hanging Gardens|Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten]]'' Op.&nbsp;15 {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=96}}. He dreaded his sixty-fifth birthday in 1939 so much that a friend asked the composer and [[astrologer]] [[Dane Rudhyar]] to prepare Schoenberg's [[horoscope]]. Rudhyar did this and told Schoenberg that the year was dangerous, but not fatal.\n\nBut in 1950, on his 76th birthday, an astrologer wrote Schoenberg a note warning him that the year was a critical one: 7 + 6 = 13 (Nuria Schoenberg-Nono, quoted in {{harvnb|Lebrecht|1985|loc=295}}). This stunned and depressed the composer, for up to that point he had only been wary of multiples of 13 and never considered adding the digits of his age. Not long after he turned 76, he died on [[Friday the 13th|Friday, 13]] July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious, and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45&nbsp;pm, 15 minutes before midnight {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=520}}. In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, \"About a quarter to twelve I looked at the clock and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then the worst is over. Then the doctor called me. Arnold's throat rattled twice, his heart gave a powerful beat and that was the end\" {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=521}}.\n\nSchoenberg's ashes were later interred at the [[Zentralfriedhof]] in Vienna on 6 June 1974 {{harv|McCoy|1999|loc=15}}.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Arnold Schoenberg}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Schoenberg Quartet No. 2 4th movement.OGG|title=Second String Quartet, fourth movement|description=Played by the [[Carmel Quartet]] with soprano Rona Israel-Kolatt, in 2007}}\n[[File:Schoenberg - Variations for Orchestra op. 31 tone row.png|thumb|300px|In Schoenberg's ''Variations for Orchestra'', Op.&nbsp;31 [[tone row]] form P1's second half has the same notes, in a different order, as the first half of I10: \"Thus it is possible to employ P1 and I10 simultaneously and in parallel motion without causing note doubling\" {{harv|Leeuw|2005|loc=154\u201355}}. {{audio|Schoenberg - Variations for Orchestra op. 31 tone row I10.mid|Play}}]]\n[[File:Schoenberg - Piano Piece op.33a tone row.png|thumb|300px|Featuring [[Combinatoriality#Hexachordal combinatoriality|hexachordal combinatoriality]] between its primary forms, P1 and I6, Schoenberg's ''Piano Piece'', Op.&nbsp;33a tone row {{audio|Schoenberg - Piano Piece op.33a tone row.mid|Play}} contains three [[perfect fifth]]s, which is the relation between P1 and I6, and a source of contrast between \"accumulations of 5ths\" and \"generally more complex simultaneity\" {{harv|Leeuw|2005|loc=155\u201357}}.

Traditionally they are divided into three periods though this division is arguably arbitrary as the music in each of these periods is considerably varied. The idea that his twelve-tone period \"represents a stylistically unified body of works is simply not supported by the musical evidence\" {{harv|Haimo|1990|loc=4}}, and important musical characteristics\u2014especially those related to [[Motif (music)|motivic development]]\u2014transcend these boundaries completely. The first of these periods, 1894\u20131907, is identified in the legacy of the high-Romantic composers of the late nineteenth century, as well as with \"expressionist\" movements in poetry and art. The second, 1908\u20131922, is typified by the abandonment of key centers, a move often described (though not by Schoenberg) as \"free atonality\". The third, from 1923 onward, commences with Schoenberg's invention of dodecaphonic, or \"twelve-tone\" compositional method. Schoenberg's best-known students, [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Alban Berg]], and [[Anton Webern]], followed Schoenberg faithfully through each of these intellectual and aesthetic transitions, though not without considerable experimentation and variety of approach.\n\n===First period: Late Romanticism===\nBeginning with songs and string quartets written around the turn of the century, Schoenberg's concerns as a composer positioned him uniquely among his peers, in that his procedures exhibited characteristics of both Brahms and Wagner, who for most contemporary listeners, were considered polar opposites, representing mutually exclusive directions in the legacy of German music. Schoenberg's Six Songs, Op.&nbsp;3 (1899\u20131903), for example, exhibit a conservative clarity of [[tonality|tonal]] organization typical of Brahms and Mahler, reflecting an interest in balanced phrases and an undisturbed [[hierarchy]] of key relationships. However, the songs also explore unusually bold incidental [[chromaticism]], and seem to aspire to a Wagnerian \"representational\" approach to motivic identity. The synthesis of these approaches reaches an apex in his ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'', Op.&nbsp;4 (1899), a [[Program music|programmatic]] work for [[string sextet]] that develops several distinctive \"[[leitmotif]]\"-like themes, each one eclipsing and subordinating the last. The only motivic elements that persist throughout the work are those that are perpetually dissolved, varied, and re-combined, in a technique, identified primarily in Brahms's music, that Schoenberg called \"[[developing variation]]\". Schoenberg's procedures in the work are organized in two ways simultaneously; at once suggesting a Wagnerian narrative of motivic ideas, as well as a Brahmsian approach to motivic development and tonal cohesion.\n\n===Second period: Free atonality===\nSchoenberg's music from 1908 onward experiments in a variety of ways with the absence of traditional keys or tonal centers. His first explicitly atonal piece was the second string quartet, Op.&nbsp;10, with soprano. The last movement of this piece has no key signature, marking Schoenberg's formal divorce from diatonic harmonies. Other important works of the era include his song cycle ''Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten'', Op.&nbsp;15 (1908\u20131909), his [[Five Orchestral Pieces]], Op.&nbsp;16 (1909), the influential ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', Op.&nbsp;21 (1912), as well as his dramatic ''[[Erwartung]]'', Op.&nbsp;17 (1909). The urgency of musical constructions lacking in tonal centers, or traditional dissonance-consonance relationships, however, can be traced as far back as his [[Chamber Symphony No. 1]], Op.&nbsp;9 (1906), a work remarkable for its tonal development of whole-tone and [[quartal harmony]], and its initiation of dynamic and unusual ensemble relationships, involving dramatic interruption and unpredictable instrumental allegiances; many of these features would typify the [[timbre]]-oriented chamber music aesthetic of the coming century.\n\n===Third period: Twelve-tone and tonal works===\nIn the early 1920s, he worked at evolving a means of order that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. This resulted in the \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\" {{harv|Schoenberg|1984|loc=218}}, in which the twelve pitches of the octave (unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. He regarded it as the equivalent in music of [[Albert Einstein]]'s discoveries in physics. Schoenberg announced it characteristically, during a walk with his friend Josef Rufer, when he said, \"I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years\" {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=277}}. This period included the ''[[Variations for Orchestra (Schoenberg)|Variations for Orchestra]]'', Op.&nbsp;31 (1928); ''Piano Pieces'', Opp.&nbsp;33a & b (1931), and the Piano Concerto, Op.&nbsp;42 (1942). Contrary to his reputation for strictness, Schoenberg's use of the technique varied widely according to the demands of each individual composition. Thus the structure of his unfinished opera ''Moses und Aron'' is unlike that of his ''Phantasy for Violin and Piano'', Op.&nbsp;47 (1949).\n\nTen features of Schoenberg's mature twelve-tone practice are characteristic, interdependent, and interactive {{harv|Haimo|1990|loc=41}}:\n# [[Hexachord]]al [[Melodic inversion|inversional]] [[combinatoriality]]\n# [[Total chromatic|Aggregates]]\n# Linear [[set (music)|set]] presentation\n# [[Derived row|Partitioning]]\n# Isomorphic partitioning\n# [[Invariant (music)|Invariants]]\n# Hexachordal [[Level (music)|levels]]\n# [[Harmony]], \"consistent with and derived from the properties of the referential set\"\n# [[Metre (music)|Metre]], established through \"pitch-relational characteristics\"\n# [[Simultaneity (music)|Multidimensional]] set presentations\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n===First works===\nAfter some early difficulties, Schoenberg began to win public acceptance with works such as the tone poem ''[[Pelleas und Melisande]]'' at a Berlin performance in 1907. At the Vienna premi\u00e8re of the ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' in 1913, he received an ovation that lasted a quarter of an hour and culminated with Schoenberg's being presented with a laurel crown ({{harvnb|Rosen|1996|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=184}}).\n\nNonetheless, much of his work was not well received. His [[Chamber Symphony No. 1]] premi\u00e8red unremarkably in 1907. However, when it was played again in the ''[[Skandalkonzert]]'' on 31 March 1913, (which also included works by [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Anton Webern|Webern]] and [[Alexander von Zemlinsky|Zemlinsky]]), \"one could hear the shrill sound of door keys among the violent clapping, and in the second gallery the first fight of the evening began.\" Later in the concert, during a performance of the ''[[Altenberg Lieder]]'' by Berg, fighting broke out after Schoenberg interrupted the performance to threaten removal by the police of any troublemakers {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=185}}.\n\n===Twelve-tone period===\nAccording to Ethan Haimo, understanding of Schoenberg's twelve-tone work has been difficult to achieve owing in part to the \"truly revolutionary nature\" of his new system, misinformation disseminated by some early writers about the system's \"rules\" and \"exceptions\" that bear \"little relation to the most significant features of Schoenberg's music\", the composer's secretiveness, and the widespread unavailability of his sketches and manuscripts until the late 1970s. During his life, he was \"subjected to a range of criticism and abuse that is shocking even in hindsight\" {{harv|Haimo|1990|loc=2\u20133}}.\n[[File:Watschenkonzert Karikatur in Die Zeit vom 6. April 1913.jpg|thumb|''Watschenkonzert'', caricature in ''Die Zeit'' from 6 April 1913]]\n\nSchoenberg criticized [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s new neoclassical trend in the poem \"Der neue Klassizismus\" (in which he derogates [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]], and obliquely refers to Stravinsky as \"Der kleine Modernsky\"), which he used as text for the third of his ''Drei Satiren'', Op.&nbsp;28 {{harv|Schonberg|1970|loc=503}}.\n\nSchoenberg's serial technique of composition with twelve notes became one of the most central and polemical issues among American and European musicians during the mid- to late-twentieth century. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing to the present day, composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]] and [[Milton Babbitt]] have extended Schoenberg's legacy in increasingly radical directions. The major cities of the United States (e.g., Los Angeles, New York, and Boston) have had historically significant performances of Schoenberg's music, with advocates such as Babbitt in New York and the Franco-American conductor-pianist [[Jacques-Louis Monod]]. Schoenberg's students have been influential teachers at major American universities: [[Leonard Stein]] at [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]; Richard Hoffmann at [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music|Oberlin]]; [[Patricia Carpenter (music theorist)|Patricia Carpenter]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]; and [[Leon Kirchner]] and Earl Kim at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Musicians associated with Schoenberg have had a profound influence upon contemporary music performance practice in the US (e.g., [[Louis Krasner]], [[Eugene Lehner]] and [[Rudolf Kolisch]] at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]; [[Eduard Steuermann]] and [[Felix Galimir]] at the [[Juilliard School]]). In Europe, the work of [[Hans Keller]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Luigi Rognoni|it}}, and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz has had a measurable influence in spreading Schoenberg's musical legacy outside of Germany and Austria. His pupil and assistant [[Max Deutsch]], who later became a professor of music, was also a conductor {{harv|Lewis|n.d.}} who made a recording of three \"master works\" Schoenberg with the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]], released posthumously in late 2013. This recording includes short lectures by Deutsch on each of the pieces {{harv|Anon.|2013}}.\n\n===Criticism===\nIn the 1920s, [[Ernst Krenek]] criticized a certain unnamed brand of contemporary music (presumably Schoenberg and his disciples) as \"the self-gratification of an individual who sits in his studio and invents rules according to which he then writes down his notes\". Schoenberg took offense at this remark and answered that Krenek \"wishes for only whores as listeners\" {{harv|Ross|2007|loc=156}}.\n\n[[Allen Shawn]] has noted that, given Schoenberg's living circumstances, his work is usually ''defended'' rather than listened to, and that it is difficult to experience it ''apart'' from the ideology that surrounds it {{harv|Taruskin|2004|loc=7}}. [[Richard Taruskin]] asserts that Schoenberg committed what he terms a \"poietic fallacy\", the conviction that what matters most (or all that matters) in a work of art is the making of it, the maker's input, and that the listener's pleasure must not be the composer's primary objective {{harv|Taruskin|2004|loc=10}}. Taruskin also criticizes the ideas of measuring Schoenberg's value as a composer in terms of his influence on other artists, the overrating of technical innovation, and the restriction of criticism to matters of structure and craft while derogating other approaches as vulgarian {{harv|Taruskin|2004|loc=12}}.{{Clarify|date=October 2013|reason=This is plainly not a criticism of Schoenberg or his music, so who exactly is Taruskin criticising, and why does this belong in this article? Response: It is a criticism of Schoenberg's reputation, and is therefore valid.}}\n\n===Relationship with the general public===\n\nWriting in 1977, [[Christopher Small]] observed, \"Many music lovers, even today, find difficulty with Schoenberg's music\" {{harv|Small|1977|loc=25}}. Small wrote his short biography a quarter of a century after the composer's death. According to [[Nicholas Cook]], writing some twenty years after Small, Schoenberg had thought that this lack of comprehension\n\n{{quote|was merely a transient, if unavoidable phase: the history of music, they said, showed that audiences always resisted the unfamiliar, but in time they got used to it and learned to appreciate it ... Schoenberg himself looked forward to a time when, as he said, grocers' boys would whistle serial music in their rounds.\n\nIf Schoenberg really believed what he said (and it is hard to be quite sure about this), then it represents one of the most poignant moments in the history of music. For serialism did not achieve popularity; the process of familiarization for which he and his contemporaries were waiting never occurred {{harv|Cook|1998|loc=46}}.}}\nBen Earle (2003) found that Schoenberg, while revered by experts and taught to \"generations of students\" on degree courses, remained unloved by the public. Despite more than forty years of advocacy and the production of \"books devoted to the explanation of this difficult repertory to non-specialist audiences\", it would seem that in particular, \"British attempts to popularize music of this kind&nbsp; ... can now safely be said to have failed.\" {{harv|Earle|2003|loc=643}}.\n\nIn his 2018 biography of Schoenberg's near contemporary and similarly pioneering composer, Debussy, [[Stephen Walsh (writer)|Stephen Walsh]] takes issue with the idea that it is not possible \"for a creative artist to be both radical and popular\". Walsh concludes, \"Schoenberg may be the first 'great' composer in modern history whose music has not entered the repertoire almost a century and a half after his birth\" {{harv|Walsh|2018|loc=321\u201322}}.\n\n===Thomas Mann's novel ''Doctor Faustus''===\nAdrian Leverk\u00fchn, the protagonist of [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1947), is a composer whose use of twelve-tone technique parallels the innovations of Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg was not happy about this and there was an exchange of letters between the men, following the novel's publication {{harv|E. R. Schoenberg|2018|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2018}}}}.\n\nLeverk\u00fchn, who may be based on [[Nietzsche]], sells his soul to the Devil. Writer [[Sean O'Brien (writer)|Sean O'Brien]] comments that \"written in the shadow of Hitler, ''Doktor Faustus'' observes the rise of Nazism, but its relationship to political history is oblique\" {{harv|O'Brien|2009}}.\n\n==Personality and extramusical interests==\n[[File:Blaues Selbstportrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|245x245px|Arnold Schoenberg, self-portrait, 1910]]\nSchoenberg was a painter of considerable ability, whose works were considered good enough to exhibit alongside those of [[Franz Marc]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=142}} as fellow members of the [[expressionist]] [[Blue Rider]] group.\n\nHe was interested in [[Hopalong Cassidy films]], which Paul Buhle and David Wagner (2002, v\u2013vii) attribute to the films' left-wing screenwriters\u2014a rather odd claim in light of Schoenberg's statement that he was a \"[[bourgeois]]\" turned [[monarchist]] {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=551\u2013552}}.\n\n== Textbooks ==\n* 1922.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. He was associated with the [[expressionism|expressionist movement]] in German poetry and art, and leader of the [[Second Viennese School]]. With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], Schoenberg's works were labeled [[degenerate music]], because they were modernist and atonal. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, becoming an American citizen in 1941.\n\nSchoenberg's approach, b\u03bfth in terms of harmony and development, has been one of the most influential of 20th-century musical thought. Many European and American composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking, whereas others have passionately reacted against it.\n\nSchoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed German [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] styles of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. Later, his name would come to personify innovations in [[atonality]] (although Schoenberg himself detested that term) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the [[twelve-tone technique]], an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered [[tone row|series]] of all twelve notes in the [[chromatic scale]]. He also coined the term [[developing variation]] and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing [[Motif (music)|motifs]] without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\n\nSchoenberg was also an influential teacher of composition; his students included [[Alban Berg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Egon Wellesz]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Stefania Turkewich]], and later [[John Cage]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Earl Kim]], [[Robert Gerhard]], [[Leon Kirchner]], [[Dika Newlin]], and [[List of music students by teacher: R to S#Arnold Schoenberg|other prominent musicians]]. Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in [[avant-garde]] musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many significant 20th-century musicologists and critics, including [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Charles Rosen]], and [[Carl Dahlhaus]], as well as the pianists [[Artur Schnabel]], [[Rudolf Serkin]], [[Eduard Steuermann]], and [[Glenn Gould]].\n\nSchoenberg's archival legacy is collected at the [[Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg Center]] in Vienna.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schoenberg 1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg in Payerbach, 1903]]\nArnold Schoenberg was born into a lower middle-class Jewish family in the [[Leopoldstadt]] district (in earlier times a Jewish [[ghetto]]) of Vienna, at \"Obere Donaustra\u00dfe 5\". His father Samuel, a native of Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]]), was a shoe-[[shopkeeper]], and his mother Pauline Schoenberg (n\u00e9e Nachod), a native of [[Prague]], was a piano teacher {{harv|Helm|2006\u20132017}}. Arnold was largely self-taught. He took only [[counterpoint]] lessons with the composer [[Alexander Zemlinsky]], who was to become his first brother-in-law {{harv|Beaumont|2000|loc=87}}.\n\nIn his twenties, Schoenberg earned a living by orchestrating [[operetta]]s, while composing his own works, such as the string sextet ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' (\"Transfigured Night\") (1899). He later made an orchestral version of this, which became one of his most popular pieces. Both [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] recognized Schoenberg's significance as a composer; Strauss when he encountered Schoenberg's ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'', and Mahler after hearing several of Schoenberg's early works.\n\nStrauss turned to a more conservative idiom in his own work after 1909, and at that point dismissed Schoenberg. Mahler adopted him as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and continued to support him, even after Schoenberg's style reached a point Mahler could no longer understand. Mahler worried about who would look after him after his death {{harv|Boss|2013|loc=118}}. Schoenberg, who had initially despised and mocked Mahler's music, was converted by the \"thunderbolt\" of Mahler's ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]]'', which he considered a work of genius. Afterward he \"spoke of Mahler as a saint\" ({{harvnb|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=103}}; {{harvnb|Schoenberg|1975|loc=136}}).\n\nIn 1898 Schoenberg converted to Christianity in the [[Lutheran]] church. According to MacDonald (2008, 93) this was partly to strengthen his attachment to Western European cultural traditions, and partly as a means of self-defence \"in a time of resurgent anti-Semitism\". In 1933, after long meditation, he returned to Judaism, because he realised that \"his racial and religious heritage was inescapable\", and to take up an unmistakable position on the side opposing Nazism. He would self-identify as a member of the Jewish religion later in life {{harv|Marquis Who's Who|n.d.}}.\n\n===1901\u20131914: experimenting in atonality===\n[[File:Gerstl - Die Familie Sch\u00f6nberg.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Sch\u00f6nberg Family]]'', a painting by [[Richard Gerstl]], 1907]]\nIn October 1901, Schoenberg married Mathilde Zemlinsky, the sister of the conductor and composer [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], with whom Schoenberg had been studying since about 1894. Schoenberg and Mathilde had two children, Gertrud (1902\u20131947) and Georg (1906\u20131974). Gertrud would marry Schoenberg's pupil Felix Greissle in 1921 {{harv|Neighbour|2001}}.\n\nDuring the summer of 1908, Schoenberg's wife Mathilde left him for several months for a young Austrian painter, [[Richard Gerstl]] (who committed suicide in that November after Mathilde returned to her marriage). This period marked a distinct change in Schoenberg's work. It was during the absence of his wife that he composed \"You lean against a silver-willow\" ({{lang-de|link=no|Du lehnest wider eine Silberweide}}), the thirteenth song in the cycle ''[[The Book of the Hanging Gardens|Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten]]'', Op.&nbsp;15, based on the collection of the same name by the German mystical poet [[Stefan George]]. This was the first composition without any reference at all to a key {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=96}}.\n\nAlso in this year, Schoenberg completed one of his most revolutionary compositions, the [[String quartets (Schoenberg)|String Quartet No.&nbsp;2]]. The first two movements, though chromatic in color, use traditional key signatures. The final two movements, again using poetry by George, incorporate a soprano vocal line, breaking with previous string-quartet practice, and daringly weaken the links with traditional tonality. Both movements end on tonic chords, and the work is not fully non-tonal.\n\nDuring the summer of 1910, Schoenberg wrote his [https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28creator%3A%22Arnold%20Sch%C3%B6nberg%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Arnold%20Schoenberg%22%29%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts%20NOT%20Goethe ''Harmonielehre''] (''Theory of Harmony'', Schoenberg 1922), which remains one of the most influential music-theory books. From about 1911, Schoenberg belonged to a circle of artists and intellectuals who included [[Lene Schneider-Kainer]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Herwarth Walden]], and [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]].\n\nIn 1910 he met [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]], an English music journalist then working in Germany. Clark became his sole English student, and in his later capacity as a producer for the BBC he was responsible for introducing many of Schoenberg's works, and Schoenberg himself, to Britain (as well as [[Anton Webern|Webern]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]] and others).\n\nAnother of his most important works from this atonal or pantonal period is the highly influential ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', Op.&nbsp;21, of 1912, a novel cycle of expressionist songs set to a German translation of poems by the Belgian-French poet [[Albert Giraud]]. Utilizing the technique of ''[[Sprechstimme]]'', or melodramatically spoken recitation, the work pairs a female vocalist with a small ensemble of five musicians. The ensemble, which is now commonly referred to as the [[Pierrot ensemble]], consists of [[flute]] (doubling on [[piccolo]]), [[clarinet]] (doubling on [[bass clarinet]]), violin (doubling on [[viola]]), violoncello, speaker, and piano.\n\nWilhelm Bopp, director of the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]] from 1907, wanted a break from the stale environment personified for him by [[Robert Fuchs]] and [[Hermann Graedener]]. Having considered many candidates, he offered teaching positions to Schoenberg and [[Franz Schreker]] in 1912. At the time Schoenberg lived in Berlin. He was not completely cut off from the Vienna Conservatory, having taught a private theory course a year earlier. He seriously considered the offer, but he declined. Writing afterward to Alban Berg, he cited his \"aversion to Vienna\" as the main reason for his decision, while contemplating that it might have been the wrong one financially, but having made it he felt content. A couple of months later he wrote to Schreker suggesting that it might have been a bad idea for him as well to accept the teaching position {{harv|Hailey|1993|loc=55\u201357}}.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Schiele - Bildnis des Komponisten Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg. 1917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arnold Schoenberg by [[Egon Schiele]], 1917]]\n[[World War I]] brought a crisis in his development. Military service disrupted his life when at the age of 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped \"beginnings\". On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was \"this notorious Schoenberg, then\"; Schoenberg replied: \"Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so I let it be me\" {{harv|Schoenberg|1975|loc=104}} (according to [[Norman Lebrecht|Norman]] {{harvtxt|Lebrecht|2001}}, this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent \"destiny\" as the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|\"Emancipator of Dissonance\"]]).\n\nIn what [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] calls an \"act of war psychosis\", Schoenberg drew comparisons between Germany's assault on France and his assault on decadent bourgeois artistic values. In August 1914, while denouncing the music of [[Bizet]], [[Stravinsky]], and [[Ravel]], he wrote: \"Now comes the reckoning! Now we will throw these mediocre kitschmongers into slavery, and teach them to venerate the German spirit and to worship the German God\" {{harv|Ross|2007|loc=60}}.\n\nThe deteriorating relation between contemporary composers and the public led him to found the [[Society for Private Musical Performances]] (''Verein f\u00fcr musikalische Privatauff\u00fchrungen'' in German) in Vienna in 1918. He sought to provide a forum in which modern musical compositions could be carefully prepared and rehearsed, and properly performed under conditions protected from the dictates of fashion and pressures of commerce. From its inception through 1921, when it ended because of economic reasons, the Society presented 353 performances to paid members, sometimes at the rate of one per week. During the first year and a half, Schoenberg did not let any of his own works be performed {{harv|Rosen|1975|loc=65}}. Instead, audiences at the Society's concerts heard difficult contemporary compositions by [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], Mahler, Webern, Berg, [[Max Reger|Reger]], and other leading figures of early 20th-century music {{harv|Rosen|1996|loc=66}}.\n\n===Development of the twelve-tone method===\n[[File:Arnold sch\u00f6nberg man ray.jpg|thumb|upright|Arnold Schoenberg, 1927, by [[Man Ray]]]]\nLater, Schoenberg was to develop the most influential version of the dodecaphonic (also known as [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]]) method of composition, which in French and English was given the alternative name [[serialism]] by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]] and [[Humphrey Searle]] in 1947. This technique was taken up by many of his students, who constituted the so-called [[Second Viennese School]]. They included [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], and [[Hanns Eisler]], all of whom were profoundly influenced by Schoenberg. He published a number of books, ranging from his famous [https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28creator%3A%22Arnold%20Sch%C3%B6nberg%22%20OR%20creator%3A%22Arnold%20Schoenberg%22%29%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts%20NOT%20Goethe ''Harmonielehre''] (Theory of Harmony) to ''Fundamentals of Musical Composition'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1967}}, many of which are still in print and used by musicians and developing composers.\n\nSchoenberg viewed his development as a natural progression, and he did not deprecate his earlier works when he ventured into serialism. In 1923 he wrote to the Swiss philanthropist [[Werner Reinhart]]:\n\n<blockquote>For the  present, it matters more to me if people understand my older works ... They are the natural forerunners of my later works, and only those who understand and comprehend these will be able to gain an understanding of the later works that goes beyond a fashionable bare minimum. I do not attach so much importance to being a musical bogey-man as to being a natural continuer of properly-understood good old tradition! ({{harvnb|Stein|1987|loc=100}}; quoted in {{harvnb|Strimple|2005|loc=22}})</blockquote>\n\nHis first wife died in October 1923, and in August of the next year Schoenberg married [[Gertrud Schoenberg|Gertrud Kolisch]] (1898\u20131967), sister of his pupil, the violinist [[Rudolf Kolisch]] ({{harvnb|Neighbour|2001}}; {{harvnb|Silverman|2010|loc=223}}). They had three children: Nuria Dorothea (born 1932), Ronald Rudolf (born 1937), and Lawrence Adam (born 1941). Gertrude Kolisch Schoenberg wrote the libretto for Schoenberg's one-act opera ''[[Von heute auf morgen]]'' under the pseudonym Max Blonda. At her request Schoenberg's (ultimately unfinished) piece, ''[[Die Jakobsleiter]]'' was prepared for performance by Schoenberg's student [[Winfried Zillig]]. After her husband's death in 1951 she founded Belmont Music Publishers devoted to the publication of his works {{harv|Shoaf|1992|loc=64}}. Arnold used the notes G and E{{music|b}} (German: Es, i.e., \"S\") for \"Gertrud Schoenberg\", in the ''Suite'', for septet, Op.&nbsp;29 (1925) {{harv|MacDonald|2008|loc=216}} (see [[musical cryptogram]]).\n\nFollowing the death in 1924 of composer [[Ferruccio Busoni]], who had served as Director of a Master Class in Composition at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] in Berlin, Schoenberg was appointed to this post the next year, but because of health problems was unable to take up his post until 1926. Among his notable students during this period were the composers Robert Gerhard, Nikos Skalkottas, and [[Josef Rufer]].\n\nAlong with his twelve-tone works, 1930 marks Schoenberg's return to tonality, with numbers 4 and 6 of the Six Pieces for Male Chorus Op.&nbsp;35, the other pieces being dodecaphonic {{harv|Auner|1999|loc=85}}.\n\n===Third Reich and move to the United States===\nSchoenberg continued in his post until the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power under [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933. While vacationing in France, he was warned that returning to Germany would be dangerous. Schoenberg formally reclaimed membership in the Jewish religion at a Paris synagogue, then traveled with his family to the United States {{harv|Friedrich|1986|loc=31}}. This happened, however, only after his attempts to move to Britain came to nothing. He enlisted the aid of his former student and great champion [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]], a senior producer with the BBC, in helping him gain a British teaching post or even a British publisher, but to no avail.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nHis first teaching position in the United States was at the [[Malkin Conservatory]] in Boston. He moved to Los Angeles, where he taught at the [[University of Southern California]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], both of which later named a music building on their respective campuses Schoenberg Hall ({{harvnb|UCLA Department of Music|[2008]}}; {{harvnb|University of Southern California Thornton School of Music|[2008]}}). He was appointed visiting professor at UCLA in 1935 on the recommendation of [[Otto Klemperer]], music director and conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and the next year was promoted to professor at a salary of $5,100 per year, which enabled him in either May 1936 or 1937 to buy a Spanish Revival house at 116 North Rockingham in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood Park]], near the UCLA campus, for $18,000. This address was directly across the street from [[Shirley Temple]]'s house, and there he befriended fellow composer (and tennis partner) [[George Gershwin]]. The Schoenbergs were able to employ domestic help and began holding Sunday afternoon gatherings that were known for excellent coffee and Viennese pastries. Frequent guests included [[Otto Klemperer]] (who studied composition privately with Schoenberg beginning in April 1936), [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], Joseph Achron, [[Louis Gruenberg]], [[Ernst Toch]], and, on occasion, well-known actors such as [[Harpo Marx]] and [[Peter Lorre]] ({{harvnb|Crawford|2009|loc=116}}; {{harvnb|Feisst|2011|loc=6}}; {{harvnb|Laskin|2008}}; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2008|loc=79}}; {{harvnb|Schoenberg|1975|loc=514}}; {{harvnb|Starr|1997|loc=383}}; {{harvnb|Watkins|2010|loc=114}}). Composers [[Leonard Rosenman]] and [[George Tremblay]] and the Hollywood orchestrator [[Edward B. Powell]] studied with Schoenberg at this time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAfter his move to the United States, where he arrived on 31 October 1933 {{harv|Slonimsky, Kuhn, and McIntire|2001}}, the composer used the alternative spelling of his surname ''Schoenberg'', rather than ''Sch\u00f6nberg'', in what he called \"deference to American practice\" {{harv|Foss|1951|loc=401}}, though according to one writer he first made the change a year earlier {{harv|Ross|2007|loc=45}}.\n\nHe lived there the rest of his life, but at first he was not settled. In around 1934, he applied for a position of teacher of harmony and theory at the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|New South Wales State Conservatorium]] in Sydney. The Director, [[Edgar Bainton]], rejected him for being Jewish and for having \"modernist ideas and dangerous tendencies.\" Schoenberg also at one time explored the idea of emigrating to [[New Zealand]]. His secretary and student (and nephew of Schoenberg's mother-in-law Henriette Kolisch), was Richard (Dick) Hoffmann Jr, Viennese-born but who lived in New Zealand in 1935\u20131947, and Schoenberg had since childhood been fascinated with islands, and with New Zealand in particular, possibly because of the beauty of the postage stamps issued by that country {{harv|Plush|1996}}.\n\n[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising - 10501.jpg|thumb| [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. In 1947 Schoenberg wrote ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'' in commemoration of this event.]]\n\nDuring this final period, he composed several notable works, including the difficult [[Violin Concerto (Schoenberg)|Violin Concerto]], Op.&nbsp;36 (1934/36), the ''[[Kol Nidre#Inspiration for other musical pieces|Kol Nidre]]'', Op.&nbsp;39, for chorus and orchestra (1938), the ''Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte'', Op.&nbsp;41 (1942), the haunting [[Piano Concerto (Schoenberg)|Piano Concerto]], Op.&nbsp;42 (1942), and his memorial to the victims of the [[Holocaust]], ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', Op.&nbsp;46 (1947). He was unable to complete his opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' (1932/33), which was one of the first works of its genre written completely using [[Twelve-tone technique|dodecaphonic composition]]. Along with twelve-tone music, Schoenberg also returned to tonality with works during his last period, like the Suite for Strings in G major (1935), the [[Chamber Symphony No. 2 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 2]] in E{{music|flat}} minor, Op.&nbsp;38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939), the Variations on a Recitative in D minor, Op.&nbsp;40 (1941). During this period his notable students included [[John Cage]] and [[Lou Harrison]].\n\nIn 1941, he became a citizen of the United States {{harv|Marcus|2016|loc=188}}. Here he was the first composer in residence at the [[Music Academy of the West]] summer conservatory {{harv|Greenberg|2019}}.\n\n=== Superstition and death ===\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Schoenberg.JPG|thumb|Schoenberg's grave in the [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna]]\nSchoenberg's superstitious nature may have triggered his death. The composer had [[triskaidekaphobia]] (the fear of the number 13), and according to friend Katia Mann, he feared he would die during a year that was a multiple of 13 (quoted in {{harvnb|Lebrecht|1985|loc=294}}). This possibly began in 1908 with the composition of the thirteenth song of the song cycle ''[[The Book of the Hanging Gardens|Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten]]'' Op.&nbsp;15 {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=96}}. He dreaded his sixty-fifth birthday in 1939 so much that a friend asked the composer and [[astrologer]] [[Dane Rudhyar]] to prepare Schoenberg's [[horoscope]]. Rudhyar did this and told Schoenberg that the year was dangerous, but not fatal.\n\nBut in 1950, on his 76th birthday, an astrologer wrote Schoenberg a note warning him that the year was a critical one: 7 + 6 = 13 (Nuria Schoenberg-Nono, quoted in {{harvnb|Lebrecht|1985|loc=295}}). This stunned and depressed the composer, for up to that point he had only been wary of multiples of 13 and never considered adding the digits of his age. Not long after he turned 76, he died on [[Friday the 13th|Friday, 13]] July 1951, shortly before midnight. Schoenberg had stayed in bed all day, sick, anxious, and depressed. His wife Gertrud reported in a telegram to her sister-in-law Ottilie the next day that Arnold died at 11:45&nbsp;pm, 15 minutes before midnight {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=520}}. In a letter to Ottilie dated 4 August 1951, Gertrud explained, \"About a quarter to twelve I looked at the clock and said to myself: another quarter of an hour and then the worst is over. Then the doctor called me. Arnold's throat rattled twice, his heart gave a powerful beat and that was the end\" {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=521}}.\n\nSchoenberg's ashes were later interred at the [[Zentralfriedhof]] in Vienna on 6 June 1974 {{harv|McCoy|1999|loc=15}}.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Arnold Schoenberg}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Schoenberg Quartet No. 2 4th movement.OGG|title=Second String Quartet, fourth movement|description=Played by the [[Carmel Quartet]] with soprano Rona Israel-Kolatt, in 2007}}\n[[File:Schoenberg - Variations for Orchestra op. 31 tone row.png|thumb|300px|In Schoenberg's ''Variations for Orchestra'', Op.&nbsp;31 [[tone row]] form P1's second half has the same notes, in a different order, as the first half of I10: \"Thus it is possible to employ P1 and I10 simultaneously and in parallel motion without causing note doubling\" {{harv|Leeuw|2005|loc=154\u201355}}. {{audio|Schoenberg - Variations for Orchestra op. 31 tone row I10.mid|Play}}]]\n[[File:Schoenberg - Piano Piece op.33a tone row.png|thumb|300px|Featuring [[Combinatoriality#Hexachordal combinatoriality|hexachordal combinatoriality]] between its primary forms, P1 and I6, Schoenberg's ''Piano Piece'', Op.&nbsp;33a tone row {{audio|Schoenberg - Piano Piece op.33a tone row.mid|Play}} contains three [[perfect fifth]]s, which is the relation between P1 and I6, and a source of contrast between \"accumulations of 5ths\" and \"generally more complex simultaneity\" {{harv|Leeuw|2005|loc=155\u201357}}. For example, group A consists of B{{music|flat}}-F-C-B{{music|natural}}, while the \"more blended\" group B consists of A-F{{music|#}}-C{{music|#}}-D{{music|#}}]]\nSchoenberg's significant compositions in the repertory of modern art music extend over a period of more than 50 years. Traditionally they are divided into three periods though this division is arguably arbitrary as the music in each of these periods is considerably varied. The idea that his twelve-tone period \"represents a stylistically unified body of works is simply not supported by the musical evidence\" {{harv|Haimo|1990|loc=4}}, and important musical characteristics\u2014especially those related to [[Motif (music)|motivic development]]\u2014transcend these boundaries completely. The first of these periods, 1894\u20131907, is identified in the legacy of the high-Romantic composers of the late nineteenth century, as well as with \"expressionist\" movements in poetry and art. The second, 1908\u20131922, is typified by the abandonment of key centers, a move often described (though not by Schoenberg) as \"free atonality\". The third, from 1923 onward, commences with Schoenberg's invention of dodecaphonic, or \"twelve-tone\" compositional method. Schoenberg's best-known students, [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Alban Berg]], and [[Anton Webern]], followed Schoenberg faithfully through each of these intellectual and aesthetic transitions, though not without considerable experimentation and variety of approach.\n\n===First period: Late Romanticism===\nBeginning with songs and string quartets written around the turn of the century, Schoenberg's concerns as a composer positioned him uniquely among his peers, in that his procedures exhibited characteristics of both Brahms and Wagner, who for most contemporary listeners, were considered polar opposites, representing mutually exclusive directions in the legacy of German music. Schoenberg's Six Songs, Op.&nbsp;3 (1899\u20131903), for example, exhibit a conservative clarity of [[tonality|tonal]] organization typical of Brahms and Mahler, reflecting an interest in balanced phrases and an undisturbed [[hierarchy]] of key relationships. However, the songs also explore unusually bold incidental [[chromaticism]], and seem to aspire to a Wagnerian \"representational\" approach to motivic identity. The synthesis of these approaches reaches an apex in his ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'', Op.&nbsp;4 (1899), a [[Program music|programmatic]] work for [[string sextet]] that develops several distinctive \"[[leitmotif]]\"-like themes, each one eclipsing and subordinating the last. The only motivic elements that persist throughout the work are those that are perpetually dissolved, varied, and re-combined, in a technique, identified primarily in Brahms's music, that Schoenberg called \"[[developing variation]]\". Schoenberg's procedures in the work are organized in two ways simultaneously; at once suggesting a Wagnerian narrative of motivic ideas, as well as a Brahmsian approach to motivic development and tonal cohesion.\n\n===Second period: Free atonality===\nSchoenberg's music from 1908 onward experiments in a variety of ways with the absence of traditional keys or tonal centers. His first explicitly atonal piece was the second string quartet, Op.&nbsp;10, with soprano. The last movement of this piece has no key signature, marking Schoenberg's formal divorce from diatonic harmonies. Other important works of the era include his song cycle ''Das Buch der H\u00e4ngenden G\u00e4rten'', Op.&nbsp;15 (1908\u20131909), his [[Five Orchestral Pieces]], Op.&nbsp;16 (1909), the influential ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'', Op.&nbsp;21 (1912), as well as his dramatic ''[[Erwartung]]'', Op.&nbsp;17 (1909). The urgency of musical constructions lacking in tonal centers, or traditional dissonance-consonance relationships, however, can be traced as far back as his [[Chamber Symphony No. 1]], Op.&nbsp;9 (1906), a work remarkable for its tonal development of whole-tone and [[quartal harmony]], and its initiation of dynamic and unusual ensemble relationships, involving dramatic interruption and unpredictable instrumental allegiances; many of these features would typify the [[timbre]]-oriented chamber music aesthetic of the coming century.\n\n===Third period: Twelve-tone and tonal works===\nIn the early 1920s, he worked at evolving a means of order that would make his musical texture simpler and clearer. This resulted in the \"method of composing with twelve tones which are related only with one another\" {{harv|Schoenberg|1984|loc=218}}, in which the twelve pitches of the octave (unrealized compositionally) are regarded as equal, and no one note or tonality is given the emphasis it occupied in classical harmony. He regarded it as the equivalent in music of [[Albert Einstein]]'s discoveries in physics. Schoenberg announced it characteristically, during a walk with his friend Josef Rufer, when he said, \"I have made a discovery which will ensure the supremacy of German music for the next hundred years\" {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=277}}. This period included the ''[[Variations for Orchestra (Schoenberg)|Variations for Orchestra]]'', Op.&nbsp;31 (1928); ''Piano Pieces'', Opp.&nbsp;33a & b (1931), and the Piano Concerto, Op.&nbsp;42 (1942). Contrary to his reputation for strictness, Schoenberg's use of the technique varied widely according to the demands of each individual composition. Thus the structure of his unfinished opera ''Moses und Aron'' is unlike that of his ''Phantasy for Violin and Piano'', Op.&nbsp;47 (1949).\n\nTen features of Schoenberg's mature twelve-tone practice are characteristic, interdependent, and interactive {{harv|Haimo|1990|loc=41}}:\n# [[Hexachord]]al [[Melodic inversion|inversional]] [[combinatoriality]]\n# [[Total chromatic|Aggregates]]\n# Linear [[set (music)|set]] presentation\n# [[Derived row|Partitioning]]\n# Isomorphic partitioning\n# [[Invariant (music)|Invariants]]\n# Hexachordal [[Level (music)|levels]]\n# [[Harmony]], \"consistent with and derived from the properties of the referential set\"\n# [[Metre (music)|Metre]], established through \"pitch-relational characteristics\"\n# [[Simultaneity (music)|Multidimensional]] set presentations\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n===First works===\nAfter some early difficulties, Schoenberg began to win public acceptance with works such as the tone poem ''[[Pelleas und Melisande]]'' at a Berlin performance in 1907. At the Vienna premi\u00e8re of the ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' in 1913, he received an ovation that lasted a quarter of an hour and culminated with Schoenberg's being presented with a laurel crown ({{harvnb|Rosen|1996|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=184}}).\n\nNonetheless, much of his work was not well received. His [[Chamber Symphony No. 1]] premi\u00e8red unremarkably in 1907. However, when it was played again in the ''[[Skandalkonzert]]'' on 31 March 1913, (which also included works by [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Anton Webern|Webern]] and [[Alexander von Zemlinsky|Zemlinsky]]), \"one could hear the shrill sound of door keys among the violent clapping, and in the second gallery the first fight of the evening began.\" Later in the concert, during a performance of the ''[[Altenberg Lieder]]'' by Berg, fighting broke out after Schoenberg interrupted the performance to threaten removal by the police of any troublemakers {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=185}}.\n\n===Twelve-tone period===\nAccording to Ethan Haimo, understanding of Schoenberg's twelve-tone work has been difficult to achieve owing in part to the \"truly revolutionary nature\" of his new system, misinformation disseminated by some early writers about the system's \"rules\" and \"exceptions\" that bear \"little relation to the most significant features of Schoenberg's music\", the composer's secretiveness, and the widespread unavailability of his sketches and manuscripts until the late 1970s. During his life, he was \"subjected to a range of criticism and abuse that is shocking even in hindsight\" {{harv|Haimo|1990|loc=2\u20133}}.\n[[File:Watschenkonzert Karikatur in Die Zeit vom 6. April 1913.jpg|thumb|''Watschenkonzert'', caricature in ''Die Zeit'' from 6 April 1913]]\n\nSchoenberg criticized [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s new neoclassical trend in the poem \"Der neue Klassizismus\" (in which he derogates [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism]], and obliquely refers to Stravinsky as \"Der kleine Modernsky\"), which he used as text for the third of his ''Drei Satiren'', Op.&nbsp;28 {{harv|Schonberg|1970|loc=503}}.\n\nSchoenberg's serial technique of composition with twelve notes became one of the most central and polemical issues among American and European musicians during the mid- to late-twentieth century. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing to the present day, composers such as [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]] and [[Milton Babbitt]] have extended Schoenberg's legacy in increasingly radical directions. The major cities of the United States (e.g., Los Angeles, New York, and Boston) have had historically significant performances of Schoenberg's music, with advocates such as Babbitt in New York and the Franco-American conductor-pianist [[Jacques-Louis Monod]]. Schoenberg's students have been influential teachers at major American universities: [[Leonard Stein]] at [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]; Richard Hoffmann at [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music|Oberlin]]; [[Patricia Carpenter (music theorist)|Patricia Carpenter]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]; and [[Leon Kirchner]] and Earl Kim at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Musicians associated with Schoenberg have had a profound influence upon contemporary music performance practice in the US (e.g., [[Louis Krasner]], [[Eugene Lehner]] and [[Rudolf Kolisch]] at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]]; [[Eduard Steuermann]] and [[Felix Galimir]] at the [[Juilliard School]]). In Europe, the work of [[Hans Keller]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Luigi Rognoni|it}}, and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz has had a measurable influence in spreading Schoenberg's musical legacy outside of Germany and Austria. His pupil and assistant [[Max Deutsch]], who later became a professor of music, was also a conductor {{harv|Lewis|n.d.}} who made a recording of three \"master works\" Schoenberg with the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]], released posthumously in late 2013. This recording includes short lectures by Deutsch on each of the pieces {{harv|Anon.|2013}}.\n\n===Criticism===\nIn the 1920s, [[Ernst Krenek]] criticized a certain unnamed brand of contemporary music (presumably Schoenberg and his disciples) as \"the self-gratification of an individual who sits in his studio and invents rules according to which he then writes down his notes\". Schoenberg took offense at this remark and answered that Krenek \"wishes for only whores as listeners\" {{harv|Ross|2007|loc=156}}.\n\n[[Allen Shawn]] has noted that, given Schoenberg's living circumstances, his work is usually ''defended'' rather than listened to, and that it is difficult to experience it ''apart'' from the ideology that surrounds it {{harv|Taruskin|2004|loc=7}}. [[Richard Taruskin]] asserts that Schoenberg committed what he terms a \"poietic fallacy\", the conviction that what matters most (or all that matters) in a work of art is the making of it, the maker's input, and that the listener's pleasure must not be the composer's primary objective {{harv|Taruskin|2004|loc=10}}. Taruskin also criticizes the ideas of measuring Schoenberg's value as a composer in terms of his influence on other artists, the overrating of technical innovation, and the restriction of criticism to matters of structure and craft while derogating other approaches as vulgarian {{harv|Taruskin|2004|loc=12}}.{{Clarify|date=October 2013|reason=This is plainly not a criticism of Schoenberg or his music, so who exactly is Taruskin criticising, and why does this belong in this article? Response: It is a criticism of Schoenberg's reputation, and is therefore valid.}}\n\n===Relationship with the general public===\n\nWriting in 1977, [[Christopher Small]] observed, \"Many music lovers, even today, find difficulty with Schoenberg's music\" {{harv|Small|1977|loc=25}}. Small wrote his short biography a quarter of a century after the composer's death. According to [[Nicholas Cook]], writing some twenty years after Small, Schoenberg had thought that this lack of comprehension\n\n{{quote|was merely a transient, if unavoidable phase: the history of music, they said, showed that audiences always resisted the unfamiliar, but in time they got used to it and learned to appreciate it ... Schoenberg himself looked forward to a time when, as he said, grocers' boys would whistle serial music in their rounds.\n\nIf Schoenberg really believed what he said (and it is hard to be quite sure about this), then it represents one of the most poignant moments in the history of music. For serialism did not achieve popularity; the process of familiarization for which he and his contemporaries were waiting never occurred {{harv|Cook|1998|loc=46}}.}}\nBen Earle (2003) found that Schoenberg, while revered by experts and taught to \"generations of students\" on degree courses, remained unloved by the public. Despite more than forty years of advocacy and the production of \"books devoted to the explanation of this difficult repertory to non-specialist audiences\", it would seem that in particular, \"British attempts to popularize music of this kind&nbsp; ... can now safely be said to have failed.\" {{harv|Earle|2003|loc=643}}.\n\nIn his 2018 biography of Schoenberg's near contemporary and similarly pioneering composer, Debussy, [[Stephen Walsh (writer)|Stephen Walsh]] takes issue with the idea that it is not possible \"for a creative artist to be both radical and popular\". Walsh concludes, \"Schoenberg may be the first 'great' composer in modern history whose music has not entered the repertoire almost a century and a half after his birth\" {{harv|Walsh|2018|loc=321\u201322}}.\n\n===Thomas Mann's novel ''Doctor Faustus''===\nAdrian Leverk\u00fchn, the protagonist of [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1947), is a composer whose use of twelve-tone technique parallels the innovations of Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg was not happy about this and there was an exchange of letters between the men, following the novel's publication {{harv|E. R. Schoenberg|2018|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2018}}}}.\n\nLeverk\u00fchn, who may be based on [[Nietzsche]], sells his soul to the Devil. Writer [[Sean O'Brien (writer)|Sean O'Brien]] comments that \"written in the shadow of Hitler, ''Doktor Faustus'' observes the rise of Nazism, but its relationship to political history is oblique\" {{harv|O'Brien|2009}}.\n\n==Personality and extramusical interests==\n[[File:Blaues Selbstportrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|245x245px|Arnold Schoenberg, self-portrait, 1910]]\nSchoenberg was a painter of considerable ability, whose works were considered good enough to exhibit alongside those of [[Franz Marc]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=142}} as fellow members of the [[expressionist]] [[Blue Rider]] group.\n\nHe was interested in [[Hopalong Cassidy films]], which Paul Buhle and David Wagner (2002, v\u2013vii) attribute to the films' left-wing screenwriters\u2014a rather odd claim in light of Schoenberg's statement that he was a \"[[bourgeois]]\" turned [[monarchist]] {{harv|Stuckenschmidt|1977|loc=551\u2013552}}.\n\n== Textbooks ==\n* 1922.

The goal of the construction was to unite the western lines from Current Junction, now part of [[Thunder Bay]], to the eastern section, between [[Toronto]] and [[Ruel, Ontario|Ruel]], which was accomplished in 1912. While this work was going on, a line was also being put in from Ottawa to [[Capreol, Ontario|Capreol]]. On June 15, 1915, the first work train arrived from Capreol. The engineer was Jim Scott. The train carried men to build bridges over Ivanhoe River, Muskego River, and Groundhog River.\n\nThe railway station at Foleyet was originally called Foley. Local legend has it that the early residents applied for a post office named to honour their former employer the Foley Brothers, but were frustrated in their wishes because the name Foley Post Office already existed near [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]]. The story is told that someone declared that \"We want to name the town for the Foley Brothers, and we'll name it Foley yet!\" and the unintended name stuck.\n\nLocated about midway between Capreol and [[Hornepayne, Ontario|Hornepayne]], Foleyet was established as a [[divisional point]], for changing train crews and servicing [[rolling stock]], and there was with a large railway [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] as well.\n\nThe town started with 15 houses. The Canadian Northern Railway built a large [[sawmill]], west of the station, equipped with a pulp barker, [[planing mill]], and a powerhouse. This mill, although owned by the railway, operated under the name Eastern Lands Division. Lumber was sold wholesale to railway employees, for home construction. A [[lumber yard]] was also established at Capreol. The Eastern Lands Co. built their main office here. They cut [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]], [[red pine]], [[spruce]] pulp logs, and [[jack pine]] [[axe ties]].\n\nThe smallest Canadian Northern steam locomotive was at Foleyet. It was an Alco 0-4-0 Saddle Tank, on the Canadian National Roster as CNR # 3. It was used at the sawmill and sold to Acme Timber in 1925. Art Boyer was the engineer.\n\nFrom Canadian Northern to Canadian National Eastern Lands Division continued their operations there until April 1925, at which time the mill was sold to Acme Timber Co. of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]. Acme was a major supplier of timber to [[CVRD Inco|Inco]]. This firm was started around 1923 by D. H. Haight, who had been supplying mining timber and fuel wood to the International Nickel Co. since the early 1900s. Haight, a native of [[New Jersey]], was a cousin of Inco's first president Ambrose Monell. The general manager of Acme Timber Co. was Haight's brother-in-law, Ben Foote Merwin. In 1932, Merwin organized Pineland Timber Co. which took over Acme in 1934.\n\nIn 1917, a dam was built, creating a new river by joining Midway Creek and Muskego Rivers. The dam broke a year later, flooding Foleyet and lowering the lake levels significantly once again. The town has had many such disasters, in the form of fires and floods, and much of its landscape differs completely now from its origins. Often when a new progress was made or added, it was simply destroyed years later.\n\nThe land occupied by Foleyet was originally an island, before an [[esker]] was destroyed and the lake receded dramatically.  Ivanhoe Lake (then known as Pishkanogami, the [[Anishinaabe]] name for it) was how the area was first explored, before Foleyet became a town. The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] had two outposts nearby, one on Lake Pishkanogami, and one on Kukatush (Groundhog) Lake. Both were closed in the 1880s due to a decline in the fur trade. It was only in 1960 that Lake Pishkanogami became Ivanhoe Lake or ''lac Ivanhoe'' in French.\n\nThe town, at present, is known as the home of the white moose. In 1998, one such moose was hit by a train, and after a day of suffering was killed by a CN worker. The head of the moose is mounted in the Northern Lights Restaurant.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{canada census\n |2011_population=193 | 2011_pop_delta=-10.6 | 2011_land_area=11.92 | 2011_pop_density=16.2\n |2011_median_age= 51| 2011_median_age_m= 49.8| 2011_median_age_f= 53.1\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=93| 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2014-05-20\n |2006_population= | 2006_pop_delta= | 2006_land_area= | 2006_pop_density=\n |2006_median_age= | 2006_median_age_m= | 2006_median_age_f=\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell= | 2006_mean_hh_income= | 2006_access_date=\n |2001_population= | 2001_pop_delta= | 2001_land_area= | 2001_pop_density=\n |2001_median_age= | 2001_median_age_m= | 2001_median_age_f=\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell= | 2001_mean_hh_income= | 2001_access_date=\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\nThe community is served by Ontario Highway 101.

Foleyet Public School closed down around 2014 and \u00c9cole Notre Dame, the latter a French [[separate school]] remains open to this day. Neither school has had more than 10 students at any one time since the early 2000s.\n\n== Train quarantine ==\n[[File:Foleyet 2008.JPG|thumb|Ontario Ministry of Health air ambulance helicopter at the scene of the \"Foleyet emergency quarantine\"]]\nOn May 9, 2008, a woman died of natural causes on a train operated by [[Via Rail]].
