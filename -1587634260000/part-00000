Green and white are also the colours of the [[leek#Cultural significance|leek]], another [[national emblem]] of Wales.\nLook! He\u2019s a red welsh dragon.\nThe oldest known use of the dragon to represent Wales is from the {{lang|la|[[Historia Brittonum]]}},<ref name=\"Davies732\">Davies (2008), pg 732.</ref> written around 830; the text describes a struggle between two serpents deep underground, which prevents King [[Vortigern]] from building a stronghold. This story was later adapted into a [[prophecy]] made by the wizard {{lang|cy|[[Merlin|Myrddin]]}} (or Merlin) of a long fight between a red dragon and a white dragon. According to the prophecy, the white dragon, representing the [[Saxons]], would at first dominate but eventually the red dragon, symbolising the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]], would be victorious and recapture {{lang|cy|[[Lloegr]]}}. According to the legend, this victory would be brought about by {{lang|cy|[[Y Mab Darogan]]}}. This is believed to represent the conflict in the 5th and 6th centuries between the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] and the invading Saxons. A version of the tale also appears as part of the poem \"{{lang|cy|[[Cyfranc Lludd a Llefelys]]}}\" in the {{lang|cy|[[Mabinogion]]|italic=no}}.<ref name=\"Davies732\"/> One twelfth-century account of this is [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s {{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}, where he states Merlin's prophecies.\n\nThe red dragon is popularly believed to have been the battle standard of [[King Arthur|Arthur]]<ref name=\"Davies732\"/> and other ancient [[Celt]]ic/[[Romano-British]] leaders. There is considerable evidence to suggest that during this period the dragon was a symbol of the Romano-British monarchy and possibly Romano-British society more broadly, including some from Anglo-Saxon poetry.<ref>Davis, Dai. [http://welshflag.org The Origin and Meaning of the Welsh Dragon]. Welsh Flag.

The Dragons of Arthur and {{lang|cy|Cadwaladr|italic=no}} were possibly based on the draco standards carried by Roman cavalry units stationed in Britain. The Draco originated with the Sarmatians, a unit of whom were stationed in [[Ribchester]] from the 2nd to 4th centuries.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nDespite the close link throughout early Welsh history, the dragon was not used exclusively as a symbol for Wales during this period, and it was used throughout Britain as a symbol of authority. In 1138, it was adopted by the Scottish as a royal standard, and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] took a dragon standard to the Third Crusade in 1191. [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] fought under the dragon at the [[Battle of Lewes]] and it was used later by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]].\n\nIn 1400, {{lang|cy|[[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]|italic=no}} raised the dragon standard during his revolts against the occupation of Wales by the English crown. {{lang|cy|Owain|italic=no}}'s banner known as {{lang|cy|Y Ddraig Aur}} ('The Golden Dragon') was raised over {{lang|cy|[[Caernarfon]]|italic=no}} during the Battle of Tuthill in 1401 against the English.

It was used by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485, after which it was carried in state to [[St Paul's Cathedral]].  The red dragon was then included as a [[supporter (heraldry)|supporter]] of the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. Several cities include a dragon in their flag design, including [[Cardiff]], the Welsh capital.\n\n==Red dragon of Wales==\n===Historic use===\n[[File:Vortigern-Dragons.jpg|thumb|right|15th-century image illustrating the story of [[Vortigern]] and the red and white dragons.]]\nThe flag was granted official status in 1959, but the red dragon itself has been associated with [[Wales]] for centuries, though the origin of the adoption of the dragon symbol is now lost in [[History of Wales|history]] and [[Welsh mythology|myth]]. A possible theory is that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] brought the emblem to what is now Wales during their [[Roman invasion of Britain|occupation]] of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in the form of the [[Draco (military standard)|Draco standards]] borne by the Roman cavalry, itself inspired by the symbols of the [[Dacians]] or [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.data-wales.co.uk/flag.htm |work=Data Wales |title=The Welsh Flag and other Welsh symbols |first=John |last=Weston |access-date=11 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127034936/http://www.data-wales.co.uk/flag.htm |archive-date=27 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Olm]] (''Proteus anguinus'') of [[Slovenia]] bear a similarity in miniature to the [[Draco (military standard)|Draco]] standard and they are referred to as baby cave dragons by the locals. The green and white stripes of the flag were additions by the [[House of Tudor]], the Welsh dynasty that held the [[Kingdom of England|English throne]] from 1485 to 1603. Green and white are also the colours of the [[leek#Cultural significance|leek]], another [[national emblem]] of Wales.\n\nThe oldest known use of the dragon to represent Wales is from the {{lang|la|[[Historia Brittonum]]}},<ref name=\"Davies732\">Davies (2008), pg 732.</ref> written around 830; the text describes a struggle between two serpents deep underground, which prevents King [[Vortigern]] from building a stronghold. This story was later adapted into a [[prophecy]] made by the wizard {{lang|cy|[[Merlin|Myrddin]]}} (or Merlin) of a long fight between a red dragon and a white dragon. According to the prophecy, the white dragon, representing the [[Saxons]], would at first dominate but eventually the red dragon, symbolising the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]], would be victorious and recapture {{lang|cy|[[Lloegr]]}}. According to the legend, this victory would be brought about by {{lang|cy|[[Y Mab Darogan]]}}. This is believed to represent the conflict in the 5th and 6th centuries between the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] and the invading Saxons. A version of the tale also appears as part of the poem \"{{lang|cy|[[Cyfranc Lludd a Llefelys]]}}\" in the {{lang|cy|[[Mabinogion]]|italic=no}}.<ref name=\"Davies732\"/> One twelfth-century account of this is [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s {{lang|la|[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]}}, where he states Merlin's prophecies.\n\nThe red dragon is popularly believed to have been the battle standard of [[King Arthur|Arthur]]<ref name=\"Davies732\"/> and other ancient [[Celt]]ic/[[Romano-British]] leaders. There is considerable evidence to suggest that during this period the dragon was a symbol of the Romano-British monarchy and possibly Romano-British society more broadly, including some from Anglo-Saxon poetry.<ref>Davis, Dai. [http://welshflag.org The Origin and Meaning of the Welsh Dragon]. Welsh Flag. Retrieved 8 August 2012</ref> The dragon is particularly associated in Welsh poetry with {{lang|cy|[[Cadwaladr]]|italic=no}}, king of {{lang|cy|[[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]|italic=no}} from {{circa|655}} to 682. The Dragons of Arthur and {{lang|cy|Cadwaladr|italic=no}} were possibly based on the draco standards carried by Roman cavalry units stationed in Britain. The Draco originated with the Sarmatians, a unit of whom were stationed in [[Ribchester]] from the 2nd to 4th centuries.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nDespite the close link throughout early Welsh history, the dragon was not used exclusively as a symbol for Wales during this period, and it was used throughout Britain as a symbol of authority. In 1138, it was adopted by the Scottish as a royal standard, and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] took a dragon standard to the Third Crusade in 1191. [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] fought under the dragon at the [[Battle of Lewes]] and it was used later by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]].\n\nIn 1400, {{lang|cy|[[Owain Glynd\u0175r]]|italic=no}} raised the dragon standard during his revolts against the occupation of Wales by the English crown. {{lang|cy|Owain|italic=no}}'s banner known as {{lang|cy|Y Ddraig Aur}} ('The Golden Dragon') was raised over {{lang|cy|[[Caernarfon]]|italic=no}} during the Battle of Tuthill in 1401 against the English.

{"title_page": "Maurer rose", "text_new": "In [[geometry]], the concept of a '''Maurer rose''' was introduced by Peter M. Maurer in his article titled ''A Rose is a Rose...''[http://www.toodoc.com/Peter-M.-Maurer-ebook.html]. A Maurer rose consists of some lines that connect some points on a [[rose curve]].<br>\n\n\n[[Image:Maurer Rose (n=7,d=29).svg|thumb|300px|A Maurer rose with ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;7 and ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;29]]\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;sin(''n&theta;'') be a [[rose curve|rose]] in the [[polar coordinate system]], where ''n'' is a positive integer. The rose has ''n'' petals if ''n'' is odd, and 2''n'' petals if ''n'' is even.\n\nWe then take 361 points on the rose:\n\n: (sin(''nk''),&nbsp;''k'') (''k'' = 0, ''d'', 2''d'', 3''d'', ..., 360''d''),\n\nwhere ''d'' is a positive integer and the angles are in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], not [[radian]]s.\n\n==Explanation==\nA '''Maurer rose''' of the rose ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;sin(''n&theta;'') consists of the 360 lines successively connecting the above 361 points. Thus a Maurer rose is a [[Polygonal chain|polygonal curve]] with [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] on a rose.\n\nA Maurer rose can be described as a closed route in the [[polar plane]]. A walker starts a journey from the origin, (0,&nbsp;0), and walks along a line to the point (sin(''nd''),&nbsp;''d''). Then, in the second leg of the journey, the walker walks along a line to the next point, (sin(''n''\u00b72''d''),&nbsp;2''d''), and so on.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Combining row and column names gives the prerequisites for the corresponding reliability coefficient. For example, Cronbach's <math>\\alpha</math> and Guttman's <math>\\lambda_3</math> are reliability coefficients derived under the condition of being unidimensional and tau-equivalent.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conventional names of reliability coefficients\n|-\n!  !!

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson formula 20, or KR-20.

A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to.

Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated the unidimensionality of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L. J. (1943). On estimates of test reliability. Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated the unidimensionality of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

Educational and Psychological Measurement, 64(3), 391\u2013418. https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164404266386</ref> encouraged readers to use generalizability theory rather than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory.

Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't understand the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

The 707B was given the same dorsal engine intake as the 707, although this was later modified to a [[NACA duct|NACA]] design. It first flew on 6 September 1950. Both these aircraft were built to test low speed characteristics.\n\nThe third aircraft, designated '''707A''', ''WD280'' was built for higher speed testing.

The 707C had \"side-by-side\" seating with dual-controls but the production order was cancelled with only the sole prototype, ''WZ744'' built.<ref name=\"Harlin and Jenks p. 176\"/> The 707C had its maiden flight on 1 July 1953 and was ultimately employed in other research that did not involve Vulcan development.<ref name=\"Buttler p. 55\">Buttler 2007, p. 55.</ref>\n\n[[File:Avro Vulcan VX770 VX777 FAR 13.09.53 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Two Avro 707As, a 707B and a 707C with both Vulcan prototypes at the SBAC [[Farnborough Air Show]] in September 1953]]\n\nEven after the Vulcan development phase was over, the four surviving 707s, in individual bright blue, red, orange and silver (natural metal) colour schemes, continued in use as research aircraft.<ref name=\"Buttler p. 55\"/> After the compound sweep investigation<ref>Jackson 1965, p. 423.</ref> and a period with the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (R.A.E) carrying out handling trials with powered controls,<ref name=\"Cooper p.108\">Cooper 2006, p. 108.</ref> the first 707A went to the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Australia for low-speed delta wing airflow measurements. The second 707A was also at the R.A.E from June 1953 for aerodynamic and later, automatic control investigations.\n\nThe Avro 707B joined the R.A.E. in September 1952<ref name=\"Cooper p.108\"/> and was one of the aircraft used by the [[Empire Test Pilots School]] from January to September 1956,<ref>Cooper 2006, p. 85.</ref> when it was damaged on landing, and broken up at R.A.E. Bedford.<ref name=\"Harlin and Jenks p. 176\"/> The two-seat 707C joined the R.A.E. January 1956; perhaps its most substantial research contribution was to the development of [[Aircraft flight control systems#Fly-by-wire control systems|fly-by-wire control]] systems, one of the first of their kind, and fitted with a side stick controller. This aircraft was flying with the R.A.E. until September 1966 when it achieved its full airframe time.<ref name=\"ElectricHunter\">Wilson, Michael, Technical editor.

By contrast, the declination of an object viewed on the [[celestial sphere]] is the angle of that object to/from the celestial equator (thus ranging from +90\u00b0 to -90\u00b0). \n\nThe location of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and other similarly distant objects is usually expressed in the following parameters, one for each of the three spatial dimensions: their [[declination]], [[right ascension]] ([[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]-fixed [[hour angle]]), and distance. These are as located at the [[Equinox#Names|vernal equinox]] for the epoch (e.g. [[J2000]]) stated.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wakker |first1=K.

The hour circle is a subtype whereby it is expressed in hours as opposed to degrees, [[radian]]s, or other units of angle. The hour circles make for easy prediction of the angle (and time due to Earth's fairly [[Earth's rotation|regular rotation]], approximately equal to the time) between the observation of two objects at the same, or similar declination.

The population estimate in 1920 was 3 million. The ruins of [[Ur]], [[Babylon]] and other ancient cities are situated in Iraq, as is the legendary location of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Almost 75% of Iraq's population lives in the flat, alluvial plain stretching southeast from [[Tikrit]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] carry about 70 million cubic meters of silt annually from this plain down to the delta. The water from these two great rivers, and the fertility of the soil in the alluvial plain and the delta, allowed early agriculture to sustain a stable population as far back as the [[7th millennium BC]].\n\n==Population==\n40,194,216 (2018 estimate),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=Middle East :: Iraq \u2014 The World Factbook \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|website=cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> {{UN_Population|Iraq}} ({{UN_Population|Year}} estimate),{{UN_Population|ref}} up from 31,234,000 (April 2009 IMF estimate)<ref name=\"imf2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2006&ey=2009&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=433&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=83&pr.y=17 |title=Iraq|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Iraq total fertility rate by region 2006.png|thumb|Iraq fertility rate by region (2006)<ref name=unicef>{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Iraq_FinalReport_2006_eng.pdf |title=Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2006 \u2013 unicef statistics|publisher=Unicef|accessdate=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| valign=right|\n{{legend|#ff0000|5\u20136}} \n{{legend|#ff6500|4\u20135}} \n{{legend|#ffff00|3\u20134}} \n{{legend|#0cff00|2\u20133}}\n|}\n]]\n\n==Vital statistics==\n===UN estimates<ref>[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The population estimate in 1920 was 3 million. The ruins of [[Ur]], [[Babylon]] and other ancient cities are situated in Iraq, as is the legendary location of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Almost 75% of Iraq's population lives in the flat, alluvial plain stretching southeast from [[Tikrit]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] carry about 70 million cubic meters of silt annually from this plain down to the delta. The water from these two great rivers, and the fertility of the soil in the alluvial plain and the delta, allowed early agriculture to sustain a stable population as far back as the [[7th millennium BC]].\n\n==Population==\n40,194,216 (2018 estimate),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html|title=Middle East :: Iraq \u2014 The World Factbook \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|website=cia.gov|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> {{UN_Population|Iraq}} ({{UN_Population|Year}} estimate),{{UN_Population|ref}} up from 31,234,000 (April 2009 IMF estimate)<ref name=\"imf2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2006&ey=2009&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=433&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=83&pr.y=17 |title=Iraq|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Iraq total fertility rate by region 2006.png|thumb|Iraq fertility rate by region (2006)<ref name=unicef>{{cite web|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Iraq_FinalReport_2006_eng.pdf |title=Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2006 \u2013 unicef statistics|publisher=Unicef|accessdate=2016-03-20}}</ref>\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| valign=right|\n{{legend|#ff0000|5\u20136}} \n{{legend|#ff6500|4\u20135}} \n{{legend|#ffff00|3\u20134}} \n{{legend|#0cff00|2\u20133}}\n|}\n]]\n\n==Vital statistics==\n===UN estimates<ref>[http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision]</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Aramaic, in antiquity spoken throughout the whole country, is now only spoken by the Assyrian Chaldean minority. The [[Iraqi Turkmen#language|Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman dialect]] of Turkish is spoken in pockets of northern Iraq (particularly in the so-called [[Turkmeneli]] region) and numerous [[languages of the Caucasus]] are also spoken by minorities, notably the Chechen community.\n\n==Religions==\n{{Main|Religion in Iraq|Islam in Iraq|Christianity in Iraq}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Iraq (est. 2003)\n|label1 = [[Shia Islam]]\n|value1 = 66\n|color1 = MediumSeaGreen\n|label2 = [[Sunni Islam]]\n|value2 = 24\n|color2 = green\n|label3 = [[Christianity in Iraq|Christianity]]\n|value3 = 5\n|color3 = blue\n|label4 = [[Yazidis]]m\n|value4 = 2\n|color4 = yellow\n|label5 = Other religion\n|value5 = 3\n|color5 = Purple\n\n}}\n\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Iraq (2017)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090513074113/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html CIA Factbook]</ref>\n|label1 = [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shia Islam]]\n|value1 = 70\n|color1 = MediumSeaGreen\n|label2 = [[Sunni Islam in Iraq|Sunni Islam]]\n|value2 = 25\n|color2 = green\n|label3 = [[Christianity in Iraq|Christianity]]\n|value3 = 3\n|color3 = blue\n|label4 = Other\n|value4 = 2\n|color4 = Purple\n}}\n\n97% of Iraqis follow [[Islam]]: 71% [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and 20% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]. 1% of these describe themselves as \"Just a Muslim\".<ref>http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/</ref> According to the CIA World Factbook, [[Shia Islam|Shias]] make up 64% of population, while [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] make up 31%.
