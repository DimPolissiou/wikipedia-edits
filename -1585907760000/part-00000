It was noticeably heavier and faster than their previous releases, showing more of a [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] sound.{{fact|date=February 2020}} \n\nSince its release the album has often been referred to simply as \"Earth A.D.\" amongst fans.

They are known mainly for their musical style, which fuses aspects of melodic punk rock, [[progressive rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] to form their primary sound.<ref name=PunkFiction>{{cite web |url=http://punkfiction.servhome.org/Strung-Out |title=Strung Out: Biographie |language=French |work=Punk Fiction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915151228/http://punkfiction.servhome.org/Strung-Out |archivedate=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> They have released nine studio albums on [[Fat Wreck Chords]] as well as one Live album, 2 B-sides collections, a best-of, a box set and appeared on numerous compilations and skate/surf/dirt bike/offroading videos. They have played on the [[Warped Tour]] and continue to tour internationally.\n\nDespite not achieving similar levels of commercial success as some of their Californian contemporaries during the Punk explosion of the 90s, Strung Out instead experienced a steady growth in popularity throughout the 2000s as mainstream attention shifted towards heavier and more technical styles music thus favoring Strung Out's more metallic sound. Subsequent releases began charting on the [[Billboard 200]]. The band's technical abilities have also earned them credit, alongside acts such as [[Lagwagon]], [[Propagandhi]], [[Belvedere (band)|Belvedere]] & [[Rich Kids on LSD|R.K.L]] for raising the level of musicianship in punk music and debunking common stereotypes of simplicity associated with punk rock.\n\n==History==\nThe band formed in 1991 in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[California]]. The original lineup consisted of vocalist [[Jason Cruz]], guitarists Jake Kiley and Rob Ramos, bassist [[Jim Cherry]] and drummer Adam Austin. After releasing a self-titled 7\" record, they became one of the first bands to be signed to [[Fat Wreck Chords]], the record label owned and operated by [[Fat Mike]] of the band [[NOFX]]. Austin left the band in 1992 and was replaced by Brad Morrison who also left the band and was replaced on drums by Jordan Burns, formerly of fellow Simi Valley natives [[Ten Foot Pole]]. Their first album, ''[[Another Day in Paradise (Strung Out album)|Another Day in Paradise]]'', was released in May 1994. ''[[Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues]]'' followed in 1996. In 1998 they released ''[[The Skinny Years...Before We Got Fat]]'', a compilation album of their pre-[[Fat Wreck Chords]] material.\n\nThe band showed notable musical growth on their 1998 album ''[[Twisted by Design]]'', which was both speedy and technical but also with darker overtones. The album established a mixture of the fast, poppy sound the band had established with Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues but mixed it with more [[atonality]] and more abstract song structures.\n\nBassist Jim Cherry was fired from the band in 1999 and went on to play in [[Pulley (band)|Pulley]] and [[Zero Down]], but died of heart failure in 2002. He was initially replaced by Craig Riker (later known for his tenure in [[Deadsy]]), but the fit was not right, so the band recruited Chris Aiken, whose musical background had a strong impact on the 2000 eight-song EP, ''[[The Element of Sonic Defiance]]''.\n\nIn 2002 the band released their fourth full-length album ''[[An American Paradox]]'', their first release to appear in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The initial production run contained a bonus song entitled \"Don't Look Back\". A video was filmed for the song \"Cemetery\" and was included on several punk rock video compilations. In 2003 they recorded and released a live album as part of the [[Fat Wreck Chords]] ''[[Live in a Dive]]'' series. ''[[Exile in Oblivion]]'', was released in 2004, with a video filmed for the song \"Analog.\" Strung Out released their sixth full-length album, ''[[Blackhawks Over Los Angeles]]'' on June 12, 2007.\n\nIn March 2009, Strung Out released a collection of rarities & B-sides entitled ''[[Prototypes and Painkillers]]''. The album is the second such compilation from the band who previously compiled similar material on ''The Skinny Years: Before We Got Fat'' in 1998.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Punk: A History|last = Kagachi|first = Chihiro|publisher = |year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nOn September 29, 2009, Strung Out released their 7th studio album titled ''[[Agents of the Underground]]''. This has a less political tone to it than their previous one, and it also combines more of the old fast sound with heavy metal influences.\n\nOn July 19, 2011, they released the compilation album ''Top Contenders: The Best of Strung Out''. In contains remastered versions of 23 songs, and 3 new songs; \"City Lights\", \"Saturday Night\", and \"Here We Are\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/768 |title=Strung Out :: Top Contenders: The Best of Strung Out - Records: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2012, drummer Jordan Burns revealed to Punknews.org that Strung Out planned to release a new album.

They are known mainly for their musical style, which fuses aspects of melodic punk rock, [[progressive rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] to form their primary sound.<ref name=PunkFiction>{{cite web |url=http://punkfiction.servhome.org/Strung-Out |title=Strung Out: Biographie |language=French |work=Punk Fiction |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915151228/http://punkfiction.servhome.org/Strung-Out |archivedate=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> They have released nine studio albums on [[Fat Wreck Chords]] as well as one Live album, 2 B-sides collections, a best-of, a box set and appeared on numerous compilations and skate/surf/dirt bike/offroading videos. They have played on the [[Warped Tour]] and continue to tour internationally.\n\nDespite not achieving similar levels of commercial success as some of their Californian contemporaries during the Punk explosion of the 90s, Strung Out instead experienced a steady growth in popularity throughout the 2000s as mainstream attention shifted towards heavier and more technical styles music thus favoring Strung Out's more metallic sound. Subsequent releases began charting on the [[Billboard 200]]. The band's technical abilities have also earned them credit, alongside acts such as [[Lagwagon]], [[Propagandhi]], [[Belvedere (band)|Belvedere]] & [[Rich Kids on LSD|R.K.L]] for raising the level of musicianship in punk music and debunking common stereotypes of simplicity associated with punk rock.\n\n==History==\nThe band formed in 1991 in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[California]]. The original lineup consisted of vocalist [[Jason Cruz]], guitarists Jake Kiley and Rob Ramos, bassist [[Jim Cherry]] and drummer Adam Austin. After releasing a self-titled 7\" record, they became one of the first bands to be signed to [[Fat Wreck Chords]], the record label owned and operated by [[Fat Mike]] of the band [[NOFX]]. Austin left the band in 1992 and was replaced by Brad Morrison who also left the band and was replaced on drums by Jordan Burns, formerly of fellow Simi Valley natives [[Ten Foot Pole]]. Their first album, ''[[Another Day in Paradise (Strung Out album)|Another Day in Paradise]]'', was released in May 1994. ''[[Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues]]'' followed in 1996. In 1998 they released ''[[The Skinny Years...Before We Got Fat]]'', a compilation album of their pre-[[Fat Wreck Chords]] material.\n\nThe band showed notable musical growth on their 1998 album ''[[Twisted by Design]]'', which was both speedy and technical but also with darker overtones. The album established a mixture of the fast, poppy sound the band had established with Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues but mixed it with more [[atonality]] and more abstract song structures.\n\nBassist Jim Cherry was fired from the band in 1999 and went on to play in [[Pulley (band)|Pulley]] and [[Zero Down]], but died of heart failure in 2002. He was initially replaced by Craig Riker (later known for his tenure in [[Deadsy]]), but the fit was not right, so the band recruited Chris Aiken, whose musical background had a strong impact on the 2000 eight-song EP, ''[[The Element of Sonic Defiance]]''.\n\nIn 2002 the band released their fourth full-length album ''[[An American Paradox]]'', their first release to appear in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The initial production run contained a bonus song entitled \"Don't Look Back\". A video was filmed for the song \"Cemetery\" and was included on several punk rock video compilations. In 2003 they recorded and released a live album as part of the [[Fat Wreck Chords]] ''[[Live in a Dive]]'' series. ''[[Exile in Oblivion]]'', was released in 2004, with a video filmed for the song \"Analog.\" Strung Out released their sixth full-length album, ''[[Blackhawks Over Los Angeles]]'' on June 12, 2007.\n\nIn March 2009, Strung Out released a collection of rarities & B-sides entitled ''[[Prototypes and Painkillers]]''. The album is the second such compilation from the band who previously compiled similar material on ''The Skinny Years: Before We Got Fat'' in 1998.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Punk: A History|last = Kagachi|first = Chihiro|publisher = |year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nOn September 29, 2009, Strung Out released their 7th studio album titled ''[[Agents of the Underground]]''. This has a less political tone to it than their previous one, and it also combines more of the old fast sound with heavy metal influences.\n\nOn July 19, 2011, they released the compilation album ''Top Contenders: The Best of Strung Out''. In contains remastered versions of 23 songs, and 3 new songs; \"City Lights\", \"Saturday Night\", and \"Here We Are\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/768 |title=Strung Out :: Top Contenders: The Best of Strung Out - Records: Fat Wreck Chords |publisher=Fatwreck.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2012, drummer Jordan Burns revealed to Punknews.org that Strung Out planned to release a new album.
