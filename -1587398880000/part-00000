It is affiliated with the [[Mennonite Church USA]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nFounded in 1887 and conferring its first four-year degrees in 1912, Bethel is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Starting in 1874, thousands of [[Russian Mennonite]]s began arriving in Kansas. In 1882, having a century of experience running their own schools, they opened Emmental, a training school for teachers, between Newton and [[Goessel, Kansas]]. The school was moved to [[Halstead, Kansas]], in 1883. A better site was found in North Newton, Kansas, and the cornerstone of the main building was laid on October 12, 1888.<ref>The cornerstone was laid by Andrew B. Shelly (1834\u20131913), then president of the General Conference Mennonite Church. (Kaufman, p. 73.)</ref> This structure, the current Administration Building, is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The Administration Building has been on the Historic Register since March 16, 1972.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Campus relocation===\nThe Halstead school was closed for the 1892\u20131893 school year while it was relocated to the new site and reopened as Bethel College in 1893. Bethel College became the second institution of higher learning associated with the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]] (now known as the ''Mennonite Church USA''), replacing [[Wadsworth Institute]] which had closed in 1878.<ref>[http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/location/campus-map/#!ad_building Administration Building page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207074854/http://www.bethelks.edu/why-bethel/location/campus-map/#!ad_building |date=December 7, 2014 }} of the Bethel College website.</ref>\n\n===North Newton===\nDuring the 1880s, Kansas cities and towns competed with one another to create, build, and construct many institutions and buildings including colleges. On May 11, 1887, representatives of the Newton community and the Kansas Conference of Mennonites signed a charter for Bethel College to be built on a plot of about {{convert|120|acre|km2}}. Over a year later on October 12, 1888, around 2,500 people gathered on the property to lay the cornerstone of what is today the Administration Building of Bethel College.   The building project took around five years to fully complete. The fund-raising to create the institution was slow, but on September 20, 1893 there was a service of dedication held for the building to be opened, and classes began.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===First college president===\nCornelius H. Wedel, a young teacher, was made Bethel College's first president. There were 98 students \u2013 77 men and 21 women ages 13 to mid-30s \u2013 living on the west end of the main floor and the ground floor of the Administration Building.  Wedel and his family lived on the east end of the Administration Building's main floor.  The classrooms, chapel, and library of 600 volumes were located on the second floor. In those days, the students were up by five in the morning and in bed by ten at night. Each student worked two hours a day at a campus job.  Student conduct was strictly monitored.  Men and women were not allowed to be in the library during the same evenings; they alternated each evening. Five men, including the president, made up the first faculty. They taught classes in the Bible, church history, German, [[English studies|English]], mathematics, science, and music. Bethel College was a bilingual college until early 1918, when the U.S. entered [[World War I]]. German was removed from the curriculum, but later reinstated: as of the 2011\u20132012 school year, two years of German were offered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bethel College German Language|url=http://www.bethelks.edu/academics/areas/german/|publisher=Bethel College|accessdate=2012-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316021136/http://bethelks.edu/academics/areas/german/|archive-date=March 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Campus facilities==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n|name      = Bethel College Administration Building\n|nrhp_type = \n|image     = bethel-administration.jpg\n|caption   = Bethel College Administration Building\n|location  = Bethel College campus, [[North Newton, Kansas]]\n|built     = 1887\n|architect = Proudfoot, Willis T.\n|architecture = Romanesque\n|added     = March 16, 1972\n|area      = {{convert|1.5|acre}}\n|governing_body = Private \n|refnum    = 72000505<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe Administration Building was the main campus structure until 1925 when the Science Hall was completed.

Berea's primary service region is Southern [[Appalachia]], but students come from 46 states in the [[United States]] and 58 other countries, with approximately one in three students an ethnic minority or from outside the U.S.<ref name=QuickFacts/>\n\n==History==\n\nFounded in 1855 by the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Gregg Fee]] (1816\u20131901), Berea College admitted both black and white students in a fully integrated [[curriculum]], making it the first non-segregated, [[coeducational]] [[college]] in [[Southern United States|the South]] and one of a handful of institutions of higher learning to admit both male and female students in the mid-19th century. The [[college]] began as a one-room schoolhouse that also served as a church on Sundays on land that was granted to Fee by politician and [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]]. Fee named the new community after the biblical [[Berea (Bible)|Berea]]. Although the school's first articles of incorporation were adopted in 1859, founder John Gregg Fee and the teachers were forced out of the area by pro-[[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] supporters in that same year.\n\nFee spent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years raising funds for the school, trying to provide for his family in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and working at [[Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park|Camp Nelson]]. He returned afterward to continue his work at Berea. He spent nearly 18 months working mostly at Camp Nelson, where he helped provide facilities for the freedmen and their families, as well as teaching and preaching. He helped get funds for barracks, a hospital, school and church.\n\n[[File:BereaCollegeAd1900.png|thumb|right|An ad for Berea College from 1900, placed in a [[African American newspapers|black newspaper]] in [[Minnesota]].]]\nIn 1866, Berea's first full year after the war, it had 187 students,  96 African American and 91 white. It began with preparatory classes to ready students for advanced study at the college level. In 1869, the first college students were admitted, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were awarded in 1873.  Almost all the private and state colleges in the South were racially segregated. Berea was the main exception until [[Day Law|a new state law in 1904]] forced its segregation.<ref>Richard Allen Heckman and Betty Jean Hall. \"Berea College and the Day Law.\" Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 66.1 (1968): 35-52.

Kentucky]]''. When the challenge failed, the college had to become a segregated school, but it set aside funds to help establish the [[Lincoln Institute (Kentucky)|Lincoln Institute]] near [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] to educate black students.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.berea.edu/about/history/ |title=About Berea College - History |publisher=Berea College |access-date=2014-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217105519/http://www.berea.edu/about/history/ |archive-date=2014-02-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In 1950, when the law was amended to allow integration of schools at the college level, Berea promptly resumed its integrated policies.\n\nIn 1925 famed advertiser [[Bruce Barton]], a future congressman, sent a letter to 24 wealthy men in America to raise funds for the college. Every single letter was returned with a minimum of $1,000 in donation.

Berea College charges no tuition; every admitted student is provided the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship (currently worth over $150,000; $39,400 per year for 2018-2019). Admission to the college is granted only to students who need financial assistance (as determined by the [[FAFSA]]); in general, applications are accepted only from those whose family income falls within the bottom 40% of U.S. households. About 75% of the college's incoming class is drawn from the Appalachian region of the South and some adjoining areas, and about 8% are international students. Generally, no more than one student is admitted from a given country in a single year (with the exception of countries in distress such as [[Liberia]]). This policy ensures that 70 or more nationalities are usually represented in the student body of Berea College. All international students are admitted on full scholarships with the same regard for financial need as U.S. students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/prospectivestudents/admissioninfo/requirements.asp|title=Admission Requirements: Prospective Students|access-date=2009-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025171003/http://www.berea.edu/prospectivestudents/admissioninfo/requirements.asp|archive-date=2009-10-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn order to support its extensive scholarship program, Berea College has one of the largest financial reserves of any American college when measured on a per-student basis.

Berea is one of only eight colleges in the [[United States]] and one of two in [[Kentucky]] ([[Alice Lloyd College]] being the other) to have mandatory work study programs. Employment opportunities range from busing tables at the [[Boone Tavern|Boone Tavern Hotel]], a historic business owned by the college, to editing, writing, publishing, and managing the College's Independent Students' Newspaper ''The Pinnacle''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pub.berea.edu/pinnacle|title=The Pinnacle - Guardians of the Students' Right to Know|website=pub.berea.edu|access-date=2015-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065422/http://pub.berea.edu/pinnacle/|archive-date=2015-09-08|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pub.berea.edu/pinnacle/about.asp|title=About The Pinnacle Newspaper- Berea College}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or managing the hanging and focusing of lights for the productions at the Theatre Lab. Other job duties include janitorial labor, building management, resident assistance, teaching assistance, food service, gardening and groundskeeping, [[information technology]], [[woodworking]], [[weaving]], and secretarial work. Some of the work-study has helped to extend and support practice of traditional crafts from the Appalachian region, such as [[weaving]]. Berea College has helped make the town a center for quality arts and crafts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/laborprogram/about.asp|title=About Our Labor Program- Berea College|access-date=2009-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005042755/http://www.berea.edu/laborprogram/about.asp|archive-date=2009-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nStudents are currently paid an hourly wage from $4.10 to $6.55 by the college, based on the WLS (\"Work, Learning, and Service\") level attached to individual labor positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/labor-program-office/pay-schedule-scale/|title=Pay Schedule & Scale|access-date=2013-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606134455/http://www.berea.edu/labor-program-office/pay-schedule-scale/|archive-date=2013-06-06|url-status=live}}</ref> The college regularly increases student pay on a yearly basis, but it has never been equivalent to the federal minimum wage in the school's history. Because of the scheduling demands of both an academic requirement and a labor requirement, students are not allowed to work at off-campus jobs.\n\n===Christian identity===\nBerea was founded by Protestant [[Christians]]. It maintains a Christian identity separate from any particular [[Christian denomination|denomination]]. The college's motto, \"[[God]] has made of one blood all peoples of the earth\", is taken from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 17|17:26]]. One General Studies course is focused on Christian faith, as every student is required to take an Understandings of Christianity course. In an effort to be sensitive to the diverse preferences and experiences of students and faculty, these courses are designed to be taught with respect for the unique spiritual journey of each individual, regardless of religious identification.\n\n===Library collections===\nThe Hutchins Library maintains an extensive collection of books, archives, and music pertaining to the history and culture of the Southern Appalachian region. The Southern Appalachian Archives contain organizational records, personal papers, oral histories, and photographs. Included are the papers of the [[Council of the Southern Mountains]] (1912\u20131989) and the [[Appalachian Volunteers]] (1963\u20131970).\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Berea College 06Quad-3 (20739403886).jpg|thumb|right|Berea College]]\n\nTechnology is an important part of life at Berea College. Since 2002, all students at Berea receive laptops that they take with them when they graduate. Students are not required to pay for the computers, though they do provide a small fee to support the technological infrastructure.\nStudents are also not allowed to have cars on campus without a special permit, and student permits for cars are rarely granted to first- or second-year students. The college provides students with supplemental transport through a shuttle bus system.\n\n===Athletics===\nBerea College teams are nicknamed as the Mountaineers. The college is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], competing in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field, and volleyball.<ref name=\"BereaAthletics\">{{cite web |title=Official Site of the Mountaineers |url=http://www.bereaathletics.com/ |website=Berea Athletics |publisher=Berea College |accessdate=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706064104/http://www.bereaathletics.com/ |archive-date=6 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn February 20, 2012, the NCAA announced it had granted Berea permission to begin a one-year period exploring membership in its Division III, non-scholarship athletic program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2012/february/diii+panel+suggests+consequences+for+not+meeting+conference+requirements |title=DIII panel suggests consequences for not meeting conference requirements |publisher=NCAA.org |accessdate=October 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831051040/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/February/DIII+panel+suggests+consequences+for+not+meeting+conference+requirements |archive-date=August 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn May 4, 2016, the [[USA South Athletic Conference]] announced that Berea would join the league effective in the 2017\u201318 school year.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.usasouth.net/general/2015-16/releases/20160503vi1mmb |title=Berea College and Pfeiffer University Set to Join USA South |publisher=USA South Athletic Conference |date=May 4, 2016 |accessdate=May 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509105718/http://usasouth.net/general/2015-16/releases/20160503vi1mmb |archive-date=May 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni and professors==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n*[[John \"Bam\" Carney]] \u2013 educator; member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from [[Campbellsville, Kentucky|Campbellsville]]\n*[[Dean W.

The [[college]] began as a one-room schoolhouse that also served as a church on Sundays on land that was granted to Fee by politician and [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]]. Fee named the new community after the biblical [[Berea (Bible)|Berea]]. Although the school's first articles of incorporation were adopted in 1859, founder John Gregg Fee and the teachers were forced out of the area by pro-[[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] supporters in that same year.\n\nFee spent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years raising funds for the school, trying to provide for his family in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and working at [[Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park|Camp Nelson]]. He returned afterward to continue his work at Berea. He spent nearly 18 months working mostly at Camp Nelson, where he helped provide facilities for the freedmen and their families, as well as teaching and preaching. He helped get funds for barracks, a hospital, school and church.\n\n[[File:BereaCollegeAd1900.png|thumb|right|An ad for Berea College from 1900, placed in a [[African American newspapers|black newspaper]] in [[Minnesota]].]]\nIn 1866, Berea's first full year after the war, it had 187 students,  96 African American and 91 white. It began with preparatory classes to ready students for advanced study at the college level. In 1869, the first college students were admitted, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were awarded in 1873.  Almost all the private and state colleges in the South were racially segregated. Berea was the main exception until [[Day Law|a new state law in 1904]] forced its segregation.<ref>Richard Allen Heckman and Betty Jean Hall. \"Berea College and the Day Law.\" Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 66.1 (1968): 35-52.

Berea College uses a course credit system, which has the following equivalencies:\n\n*A 0.25 credit course is the equivalent of 1 semester hour.\n*A 0.50 credit course is the equivalent of 2 semester hours.\n*A 0.75 credit course is equivalent to 3 semester hours.\n*A 1.00 credit course is the equivalent to 4 semester hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/academicservices/adviserguide/transferadvising/tcwcpe.asp|title=Academic Services Advisor Guide: Berea College|access-date=2009-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719142701/http://www.berea.edu/academicservices/adviserguide/transferadvising/tcwcpe.asp|archive-date=2011-07-19|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAll students are required to attend the college on a full-time basis, which is 3.00 course credits of enrollment, or 12 semester hours. Students must be enrolled in at least 4.00 course credits to be considered for the Dean's list. Enrollment in 4.75 or more course credits requires the approval of the Academic Adviser, and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.30. There are also optional Summer opportunities to engage in study. Students may take between 1 and 2.25 credits during Summer. One Berea course credit is equivalent to four semester hours (6 quarter hours). Part-time enrollment is not permitted except during Summer term. A cumulative [[GPA]] of 2.0 is required in all majors in order to graduate with a bachelor's degree.\n\n===Rankings===\n{{Infobox US university ranking\n| Forbes   = 464\n| USNWR_LA = 46\n| Wamo_LA  = 4\n| THE_WSJ  = 231\n}}\nIn 2019, ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' ranked Berea College 4th in the U.S. among liberal arts colleges based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019college-guide|title=2019 Liberal Arts College Rankings|publisher=Washington Monthly|access-date=September 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913044629/https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019college-guide|archive-date=September 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The 2020 annual ranking of ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' categorizes Berea as 'more selective' and rates it tied for 46th overall, 2nd for \"Most Innovative Schools\", 4th for \"Best Undergraduate Teaching\" and tied for 14th in \"Top Performers in Social Mobility\" among liberal arts colleges in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/berea-college-1955/overall-rankings |title=Berea College Rankings |year=2020 |magazine=U.S. News & World Report |access-date=September 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181220142744/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/berea-college-1955/overall-rankings |archive-date=December 20, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Kiplinger's Personal Finance]]'' places Berea 35th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kiplinger.com/tool/college/T014-S001-best-college-values-college-finder/school/5322/berea-college/ |magazine=Kiplinger's Personal Finance |title=Kiplinger's Best College Values |date=July 2019 |access-date=2019-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821080001/https://www.kiplinger.com/tool/college/T014-S001-best-college-values-college-finder/school/5322/berea-college/ |archive-date=2019-08-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Scholarships and work program===\nBerea College provides all students with full-tuition scholarships and many receive support for room and board as well. Berea College charges no tuition; every admitted student is provided the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship (currently worth over $150,000; $39,400 per year for 2018-2019). Admission to the college is granted only to students who need financial assistance (as determined by the [[FAFSA]]); in general, applications are accepted only from those whose family income falls within the bottom 40% of U.S. households. About 75% of the college's incoming class is drawn from the Appalachian region of the South and some adjoining areas, and about 8% are international students. Generally, no more than one student is admitted from a given country in a single year (with the exception of countries in distress such as [[Liberia]]). This policy ensures that 70 or more nationalities are usually represented in the student body of Berea College. All international students are admitted on full scholarships with the same regard for financial need as U.S. students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/prospectivestudents/admissioninfo/requirements.asp|title=Admission Requirements: Prospective Students|access-date=2009-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025171003/http://www.berea.edu/prospectivestudents/admissioninfo/requirements.asp|archive-date=2009-10-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn order to support its extensive scholarship program, Berea College has one of the largest financial reserves of any American college when measured on a per-student basis. The endowment was $1.192 billion as of June 30, 2018.<ref name=nacubo>As of June 30, 2018. {{cite web |url=https://www.nacubo.org/-/media/Nacubo/Documents/research/2018-Endowment-Market-Values--Final.pdf |title=U.S. and Canadian Institutions Listed by Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Endowment Market Value and Change in Endowment Market Value from FY 2017 to FY 2018 |publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute |year= 2018 |access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> The base of Berea College's finances is dependent on substantial contributions from individuals, foundations, corporations that support the mission of the college and donations from alumni. A solid investment strategy increased the endowment from $150 million in 1985 to its current amount.<ref>Brull, Steven. (September 2005). \"Appalachian spring\". ''Institutional Investor'', p. 35.</ref>\n\nAs a [[work college]], Berea has a student work program in which all students work 10 or more hours per week on campus. Berea is one of only eight colleges in the [[United States]] and one of two in [[Kentucky]] ([[Alice Lloyd College]] being the other) to have mandatory work study programs. Employment opportunities range from busing tables at the [[Boone Tavern|Boone Tavern Hotel]], a historic business owned by the college, to editing, writing, publishing, and managing the College's Independent Students' Newspaper ''The Pinnacle''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pub.berea.edu/pinnacle|title=The Pinnacle - Guardians of the Students' Right to Know|website=pub.berea.edu|access-date=2015-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908065422/http://pub.berea.edu/pinnacle/|archive-date=2015-09-08|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pub.berea.edu/pinnacle/about.asp|title=About The Pinnacle Newspaper- Berea College}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or managing the hanging and focusing of lights for the productions at the Theatre Lab. Other job duties include janitorial labor, building management, resident assistance, teaching assistance, food service, gardening and groundskeeping, [[information technology]], [[woodworking]], [[weaving]], and secretarial work. Some of the work-study has helped to extend and support practice of traditional crafts from the Appalachian region, such as [[weaving]]. Berea College has helped make the town a center for quality arts and crafts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/laborprogram/about.asp|title=About Our Labor Program- Berea College|access-date=2009-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005042755/http://www.berea.edu/laborprogram/about.asp|archive-date=2009-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nStudents are currently paid an hourly wage from $4.10 to $6.55 by the college, based on the WLS (\"Work, Learning, and Service\") level attached to individual labor positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berea.edu/labor-program-office/pay-schedule-scale/|title=Pay Schedule & Scale|access-date=2013-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606134455/http://www.berea.edu/labor-program-office/pay-schedule-scale/|archive-date=2013-06-06|url-status=live}}</ref> The college regularly increases student pay on a yearly basis, but it has never been equivalent to the federal minimum wage in the school's history. Because of the scheduling demands of both an academic requirement and a labor requirement, students are not allowed to work at off-campus jobs.\n\n===Christian identity===\nBerea was founded by Protestant [[Christians]]. It maintains a Christian identity separate from any particular [[Christian denomination|denomination]]. The college's motto, \"[[God]] has made of one blood all peoples of the earth\", is taken from [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] [[s:Bible (King James)/Acts#Chapter 17|17:26]]. One General Studies course is focused on Christian faith, as every student is required to take an Understandings of Christianity course. In an effort to be sensitive to the diverse preferences and experiences of students and faculty, these courses are designed to be taught with respect for the unique spiritual journey of each individual, regardless of religious identification.\n\n===Library collections===\nThe Hutchins Library maintains an extensive collection of books, archives, and music pertaining to the history and culture of the Southern Appalachian region. The Southern Appalachian Archives contain organizational records, personal papers, oral histories, and photographs. Included are the papers of the [[Council of the Southern Mountains]] (1912\u20131989) and the [[Appalachian Volunteers]] (1963\u20131970).\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Berea College 06Quad-3 (20739403886).jpg|thumb|right|Berea College]]\n\nTechnology is an important part of life at Berea College. Since 2002, all students at Berea receive laptops that they take with them when they graduate. Students are not required to pay for the computers, though they do provide a small fee to support the technological infrastructure.\nStudents are also not allowed to have cars on campus without a special permit, and student permits for cars are rarely granted to first- or second-year students. The college provides students with supplemental transport through a shuttle bus system.\n\n===Athletics===\nBerea College teams are nicknamed as the Mountaineers. The college is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], competing in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field, and volleyball.<ref name=\"BereaAthletics\">{{cite web |title=Official Site of the Mountaineers |url=http://www.bereaathletics.com/ |website=Berea Athletics |publisher=Berea College |accessdate=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706064104/http://www.bereaathletics.com/ |archive-date=6 July 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn February 20, 2012, the NCAA announced it had granted Berea permission to begin a one-year period exploring membership in its Division III, non-scholarship athletic program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest+news/2012/february/diii+panel+suggests+consequences+for+not+meeting+conference+requirements |title=DIII panel suggests consequences for not meeting conference requirements |publisher=NCAA.org |accessdate=October 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831051040/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/February/DIII+panel+suggests+consequences+for+not+meeting+conference+requirements |archive-date=August 31, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn May 4, 2016, the [[USA South Athletic Conference]] announced that Berea would join the league effective in the 2017\u201318 school year.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.usasouth.net/general/2015-16/releases/20160503vi1mmb |title=Berea College and Pfeiffer University Set to Join USA South |publisher=USA South Athletic Conference |date=May 4, 2016 |accessdate=May 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509105718/http://usasouth.net/general/2015-16/releases/20160503vi1mmb |archive-date=May 9, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni and professors==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n*[[John \"Bam\" Carney]] \u2013 educator; member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from [[Campbellsville, Kentucky|Campbellsville]]\n*[[Dean W.

Legend on seal: ''Sigillum Petri Corbet'' (\"Seal of Peter Corbet\")}}\n\nThe '''Corbet family''' is an English family of Anglo-Norman extraction that became one of the most powerful and richest of the [[landed gentry]] in [[Shropshire]]. They trace their ancestry to two barons found in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]] and probably derive from the Brioton and [[Essay, Orne|Essay]] region, near [[S\u00e9es]] in [[Normandy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Keats-Rohan|first=K. S. B.|title=Domesday People|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1999|pages=373, 400}}</ref> The name Corbet derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word ''corb'', meaning \"crow\",{{sfnp|Hanks|Hodges|Mills|Room|2002|p=141|ps=none}} matching the modern French ''corbeau''. Variants of the name include: Corbet, Corbett, Corbitt, Corbit, Corbetts, Corbete, Corben and possibly the variant of Corbin. It has [[cognate]]s in other languages: the Spanish name ''Cuervo'', for example, which generally means a [[raven]] or [[Rook (bird)|rook]].{{sfnp|Hanks|Hodges|Mills|Room|2002|p=152|ps=none}} The underlying derivation is from the Latin word ''corvus'', crow. Generally it is thought to be a jocular reference to a person who was thought to resemble a crow: in hair colour, tone of voice or shape of nose. However, the Scandinavians believed that a raven on the battlefield was a beneficial omen and ensured victory.\n\nFurthermore in Italy there are two families called Corvo (or Corbo) and Corvino (or Corbino), in English they mean Crow and Little Crow respectively. These families descend from the Roman [[gens Valeria]], the first descendants of Valeri Massimi while the second descendants from Valeri Poplicola. The surname is really due to an event described by Tito Livius in book 7, chapter 26 of \"Ab Urbe Condita\". A battle is described where the Roman military tribune [[Marcus Valerius Corvus|Marcus Valerius]] was helped by a crow during a duel and for this he took the nickname Corvus.\nIn fact it could be a family that has Roman origins, which is why it is found throughout Europe with the same translated surnames and shields of similar or equal blazons: the Romans, in order to colonize the conquered territories, had the custom of installing some members of the 14 families founders of Rome, like the gens Valeria.\n\n==History==\n===Feudal barons of Caus and their descendants===\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Roger Corbet and his brother Robert were listed as some of the most important [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] of the king and the powerful [[Marcher Lord]] [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger, Earl of Shrewsbury]]<ref>Sanders, I. J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p. 29.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://domesdaymap.co.uk/name/455000/robert-son-of-corbet/ | title=Open Domesday Project | publisher=University of Hull | accessdate=2012-08-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001743/http://domesdaymap.co.uk/name/455000/robert-son-of-corbet/ | archive-date=2013-10-17 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Roger is generally believed to have been the first [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]] of [[Caus Castle|Caus]] in [[Shropshire]], which was a barony within the marcher lordship of Roger de Montgomerie (died 1094). He was succeeded after 1121 by his son Robert Corbet (d. pre-1155). He was succeeded by Roger Corbet, who himself was succeeded by Robert (died 1222), who left a son Thomas who died in 1274. There followed his son and heir Peter Corbet (died 1300) who left a son Peter Corbet (died 1322), who died childless. The barony then passed to his half-brother John. Although the family soon died out in the senior line, when the barony was lost, cadet branches spread out and thrived.\n\n====Corbets of Moreton Corbet====\nFrom the eclipse of the senior line at Caus, the most important Shropshire branch of the Corbets was that of Moreton Toret, later called [[Moreton Corbet]], where they had a [[Moreton Corbet Castle|castle]]. Members of this branch regularly represented [[Shropshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Shropshire]], and sometimes other constituencies, in the [[House of Commons of England]] over several centuries. They were the among the most powerful and richest of [[landed gentry]] families in the county, especially in the 16th century, when there was no resident [[aristocracy]].{{sfnp|Coulton|2010|p=40|ps=none}} Together with its offshoots at [[Stoke upon Tern]] and Stanwardine, the Moreton Corbet family played a major part in the county's passage through the [[English Reformation]] and the [[English Civil War]]. Some of the Corbet politicians are featured in the family tree below. The Corbets long retained part of their former vast estates in Shropshire. The [[Return of Owners of Land, 1873]] showed that, of the 13 landowners who owned more than 8,000 acres in the county, two were Corbets: Sir V. R. Corbet owned 9,489 acres and I. D. Corbet owned 8,118 acres.\n\n{{chart top|width=100%|text-align=left|The Corbets of Moreton Corbet, Stanwardine and Stoke}}\nBased on pedigrees derived from the Heraldic Visitation of Shropshire,

By the 20th century the Corbets were the largest land owners in the Vale Parish once known as the Clos du Valle. The Corbets under Jean Thomas Corbet Esq. (1836\u20131926) owned and operated two granite quarries which they exported stone to England. Louise Corbet, daughter of Jean Thomas married John Bichard and thus together the families created the first glasshouse growing operation in Guernsey; the vast estate was called \"Les Landes\". The Corbets entertained King George V and Queen Mary on their visit to the vineries in 1921. The Corbets' Fruit Export Company thrived and they were suppliers to Buckingham Palace. In the 1930s the Corbet family donated land that would become the Corbet Field, an important athletic area.\nChristian Cardell Corbet, a Canadian artist, is the third great grandson of Jean Thomas Corbet.\nNotable descendants and relatives of Jean Thomas Corbet include;\n\u2013 [[Denys Corbet]], (1826\u20131909) \u2013 Poet and painter.

He is said to have obtained the manor of [[Fogo, Scottish Borders|Fogo]] which he held as a vassal under the [[Earl of Dunbar|Earls of Dunbar]].\n\nRobert fitz Corbet appeared in Scotland in about 1116 as one of the retinue of Earl David, who later became King David I. The author, Augusta Corbet, who wrote ''The Family of Corbet&nbsp;\u2013 Its Life and Times'', says that Robert was the son of Roger Corbet and grandson of Corbet le Normand. It is said he belonged to the family which held [[Drayton, Northamptonshire|Drayton]] in Northamptonshire.\n\nRobert Corbet was a witness in the instrument or Inquisition made by David, Prince of Cumberland, into the lands belonging to the old Church of Glasgow, and is also a witness in other deeds of David when he was King of Scotland (1124\u201353).\n\n{{quote|The Cumberland or Cumbria of those days extended to the Clyde, and included Glasgow, which David incorporated into Scotland. David appears to have allotted lands in Roxburghshire to Robert Corbet, where his descendants were \"great lords of several generations\". For many centuries the Corbets held lands in the Scottish Borders and were loyal to Scotland. By the late 13th century, the Corbets owned land in the Castle Douglas/ Dalbeattie areas in addition to their traditional tenures. A century later, Constantine Corbet owned lands in Fife and a Walter Corbet owned lands around Lochmaben. By the late 16th century, Corbets owned lands in Clydesdale, with Symont Corbet's will showing land held near Hamilton (1574).|}}\n\nIn 1745 the Corbets supported the British Government. When Bonnie Prince Charlie landed in Scotland. Robert Corbet, then provost of Dumfries, rode out with his men to meet him and warned the Prince to stand aside as Dumfries would have nothing to do with him. He then returned to Dumfries and locked the gates against the Prince.\n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Corbets were busy in Scotland in a variety of occupations, including shipmasters, tanners, tailors, schoolmasters, weavers, etc. In 1784, James Corbett was a weaver in Larkhall and in Hamilton, other Corbetts were prospering in the late 18th century. Janefield, part of the Tollcross estate and now a cemetery, was occupied and farmed by a James Corbett in 1751.\n\nThe Glasgow line of the present-day Corbetts (which includes the present day Lord Rowallan)(see Burke's peerage) descends from Dr Lorimer Corbett (born 1782) who was a well-regarded Glasgow surgeon, himself from a line of medical men. Today's generation of the direct descendants of Dr Lorimer Corbett of Glasgow can trace their lineage to him and his three sons, Robert Telfer, Andrew and Thomas. In 1859 his eldest son, Dr Robert Telfer Corbett, competed for the Regius Chair of Surgery at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Although unsuccessful, he had the honour of losing out to Sir [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], 'the father of modern antisepsis'. In 1864, Robert Telfer Corbett emigrated to New Zealand with his wife and eight children, where many of his descendants now live. Robert Telfer's eldest son was called Lorimer and Lorimer's eldest son was called Robert Lorimer. This eldest son, the grandson of Robert Telfer Corbett and his uncle (named Leech) is associated with the early colonial history of Malaysia. Colonel Robert Lorimer Corbett, CBE, and his brothers Maxwell and Frank were at the forefront of the early tin-mining operations in Ipoh, Malaysia during the early 1900s, owning rubber and coconut plantations there. Robert also had a distinguished military career during the First World War. After the war he settled in England with his family. His children were the last of this line to bear the name ''Corbett'' who could trace their direct lineage back through three generations of elder sons, to Dr. Lorimer Corbett of Glasgow. Many of these descendants now reside in the south of England and Canada. The present Lord Rowallan, John Corbett (b. 1947) who traces his lineage back through Thomas Corbett (b. 1822) the third son of Dr. Lorimer Corbett, resides in Ayrshire, Scotland. (Source: Genealogical research on this has been verified through family records, BMD indexes and original research by M. Learmount daughter of Noreen Corbett and granddaughter of Colonel R.L. Corbett CBE).\n\n==Castles and seats==\n\n*[[Acton Reynald Hall]] is a 19th-century country manor house and park created by the Corbet Family in the 17th century at Acton Reynald, Shropshire, England, and an example of one of the many Corbet Lordships in Shropshire.\n*[[Acton Burnell Castle]] ruins about eight miles Southeast of Shrewsbury, near to the Acton Burnell Church and Hall, claim attention, from the many interesting and historical facts connected with it; it is recorded a Parliament was held here in the year 1283 by Edward I, on which occasion the Lords sat at Shrewsbury, and the Commons in the banqueting hall of the castle here, the gable ends of which still remain; here it was that the statute known by the name of the Acton Burnell Statute or \"Statuta de Mercatoribus (Statutes of Merchants)\" was passed. Long before Edward I, William The Conqueror took the Saxon Godric's manor from him and gave it to the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, who in turn conferred it on Roger Fitz-Corbet. It is supposed that Roger, the Domesday tenant of Actune, was ancestor of those Burnels, from whom afterwards the manor took its distinctive title of Acton Burnell.\n*[[Alberbury Castle]] was built by Fulke Fitz Warine in the 13th century and held under the Barons of Caus, was added protection for Shrewsbury Castle against the threat of the Welsh. In addition, Shropshire was also given a Norman sheriff called Warin who held a number of manors around Oswestry.\n*[[Caus Castle]] (also known as, or recorded in historical documents as Cause; Caurs; Chaus; Caws; Caurse; Alretone; Auretone; Averetonee), often described as a fortress of uncommon strength and extent, is about 2 miles southwest of Westbury, Shropshire, England and is located along the Welsh Marches. Caux Castle was built by Roger Corbet (1066\u20131134) a domesday founder for his family, and is named for his homeland in [[Pays de Caux]], Normandy, France, and was the seat of their [[Marcher Lordships]] granted under Roger de Montgomery (Roger de Montgomery), Earl of Shrewsbury (Shropshire) and King William the Conqueror.\n*[[Hopton Castle]] is in the [[Hopton Castle, Shropshire|village of the same name]] and is located between Knighton, Powys, Wales and Craven Arms (Newton), Shropshire, England. Hopton Castle passed by marriage to the Moreton Corbet family in the 15th century.\n*[[High Ercall Hall]] & High Ercall Church (pronounced High Arcal) in the borough of Telford & Wrekin, were owned by the Corbets by marriage to the Newport's.\n*[[Longnor Hall]] A 17th-century manor house built by the Corbets in the Shropshire village of Longnor. The hall displays the Corbet crow arms on its gable end.\n*[[Moreton Corbet Castle]] in Shropshire, England was acquired by the Corbets in 1235, when Sir Richard Corbet of Wettlesborough b. 1191, who married Joan Thoreton b. 1200 the daughter or Bartholomew Thoreton of Moreton Thoret. Sometime around 1560 Sir Andrew Corbet rebuilt the castle and built a new east range with a great hall, to this was added an ornate south range designed in a L-shape by Sir Andrew's son, Robert Corbet. It is this latter addition that stands as one of the landmarks in English architectural history.\n*[[Rowallan Castle]] was the seat for later chiefs of the Corbets which was originally the seat of the chiefs of [[Clan Muir]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theclanmuir.org/Rowallan_castle.htm | title=Rowallan Castle Ancestral Home of Clan Muir | publisher=Clan Muir|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.old-picture.com/europe/Kilmarnock-Rowallan-Scotland-Castle.htm | title=Rowallan Castle, Kilmarnock, Scotland | publisher=old-picture.com |accessdate=2009-05-25 }}</ref>\n*[[Sibdon Castle]] in Sibdon Carwood, near Newton, Shropshire, England. The fortified manor at [[Sibdon Carwood]], the predecessor to the 17th-century Sibdon Castle country house, is given the name \"Shepeton Corbet\" by a number of historical documents, including that of John Leland (c. 1535\u201343), who also gives the suffix to [[Hopton Castle|Hopton Corbet Castle]] and Moreton Corbet Castle. This is an indication that the Corbet family owned these fortified manors around the time, of which Moreton Corbet's castle both remains in their ownership and retains the suffix to this day.\n*[[Sundorne Castle]] is home of the Corbet-Pigott family\n*[[Wattlesborough Castle]] was a fortified manor held by the Barons of Caus, which later passed from the Corbets to the John de Mowthe Family.\n*[[Siston]], Gloucestershire, which branch died out in the late 14th century.

Legend on seal: ''Sigillum Petri Corbet'' (\"Seal of Peter Corbet\")}}\n\nThe '''Corbet family''' is an English family of Anglo-Norman extraction that became one of the most powerful and richest of the [[landed gentry]] in [[Shropshire]]. They trace their ancestry to two barons found in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]] and probably derive from the Brioton and [[Essay, Orne|Essay]] region, near [[S\u00e9es]] in [[Normandy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Keats-Rohan|first=K. S. B.|title=Domesday People|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1999|pages=373, 400}}</ref> The name Corbet derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word ''corb'', meaning \"crow\",{{sfnp|Hanks|Hodges|Mills|Room|2002|p=141|ps=none}} matching the modern French ''corbeau''. Variants of the name include: Corbet, Corbett, Corbitt, Corbit, Corbetts, Corbete, Corben and possibly the variant of Corbin. It has [[cognate]]s in other languages: the Spanish name ''Cuervo'', for example, which generally means a [[raven]] or [[Rook (bird)|rook]].{{sfnp|Hanks|Hodges|Mills|Room|2002|p=152|ps=none}} The underlying derivation is from the Latin word ''corvus'', crow. Generally it is thought to be a jocular reference to a person who was thought to resemble a crow: in hair colour, tone of voice or shape of nose. However, the Scandinavians believed that a raven on the battlefield was a beneficial omen and ensured victory.\n\nFurthermore in Italy there are two families called Corvo (or Corbo) and Corvino (or Corbino), in English they mean Crow and Little Crow respectively. These families descend from the Roman [[gens Valeria]], the first descendants of Valeri Massimi while the second descendants from Valeri Poplicola. The surname is really due to an event described by Tito Livius in book 7, chapter 26 of \"Ab Urbe Condita\". A battle is described where the Roman military tribune [[Marcus Valerius Corvus|Marcus Valerius]] was helped by a crow during a duel and for this he took the nickname Corvus.\nIn fact it could be a family that has Roman origins, which is why it is found throughout Europe with the same translated surnames and shields of similar or equal blazons: the Romans, in order to colonize the conquered territories, had the custom of installing some members of the 14 families founders of Rome, like the gens Valeria.\n\n==History==\n===Feudal barons of Caus and their descendants===\nIn the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Roger Corbet and his brother Robert were listed as some of the most important [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] of the king and the powerful [[Marcher Lord]] [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger, Earl of Shrewsbury]]<ref>Sanders, I.

He was succeeded after 1121 by his son Robert Corbet (d. pre-1155). He was succeeded by Roger Corbet, who himself was succeeded by Robert (died 1222), who left a son Thomas who died in 1274. There followed his son and heir Peter Corbet (died 1300) who left a son Peter Corbet (died 1322), who died childless. The barony then passed to his half-brother John. Although the family soon died out in the senior line, when the barony was lost, cadet branches spread out and thrived.\n\n====Corbets of Moreton Corbet====\nFrom the eclipse of the senior line at Caus, the most important Shropshire branch of the Corbets was that of Moreton Toret, later called [[Moreton Corbet]], where they had a [[Moreton Corbet Castle|castle]]. Members of this branch regularly represented [[Shropshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Shropshire]], and sometimes other constituencies, in the [[House of Commons of England]] over several centuries. They were the among the most powerful and richest of [[landed gentry]] families in the county, especially in the 16th century, when there was no resident [[aristocracy]].{{sfnp|Coulton|2010|p=40|ps=none}} Together with its offshoots at [[Stoke upon Tern]] and Stanwardine, the Moreton Corbet family played a major part in the county's passage through the [[English Reformation]] and the [[English Civil War]]. Some of the Corbet politicians are featured in the family tree below. The Corbets long retained part of their former vast estates in Shropshire. The [[Return of Owners of Land, 1873]] showed that, of the 13 landowners who owned more than 8,000 acres in the county, two were Corbets: Sir V. R. Corbet owned 9,489 acres and I. D.

was\n\u2013 Major Gov. [[Moses Corbet]] (1728\u20131814) \u2013 Lieutenant Governor of Jersey.\nMost of the Corbets had already moved to or later moved to [[Guernsey]] where the family flourished until c. 1956 upon the death of William Corbet, son of Jean Thomas Corbet. By the 20th century the Corbets were the largest land owners in the Vale Parish once known as the Clos du Valle. The Corbets under Jean Thomas Corbet Esq. (1836\u20131926) owned and operated two granite quarries which they exported stone to England. Louise Corbet, daughter of Jean Thomas married John Bichard and thus together the families created the first glasshouse growing operation in Guernsey; the vast estate was called \"Les Landes\". The Corbets entertained King George V and Queen Mary on their visit to the vineries in 1921. The Corbets' Fruit Export Company thrived and they were suppliers to Buckingham Palace. In the 1930s the Corbet family donated land that would become the Corbet Field, an important athletic area.\nChristian Cardell Corbet, a Canadian artist, is the third great grandson of Jean Thomas Corbet.\nNotable descendants and relatives of Jean Thomas Corbet include;\n\u2013 [[Denys Corbet]], (1826\u20131909) \u2013 Poet and painter.

He is said to have obtained the manor of [[Fogo, Scottish Borders|Fogo]] which he held as a vassal under the [[Earl of Dunbar|Earls of Dunbar]].\n\nRobert fitz Corbet appeared in Scotland in about 1116 as one of the retinue of Earl David, who later became King David I. The author, Augusta Corbet, who wrote ''The Family of Corbet&nbsp;\u2013 Its Life and Times'', says that Robert was the son of Roger Corbet and grandson of Corbet le Normand. It is said he belonged to the family which held [[Drayton, Northamptonshire|Drayton]] in Northamptonshire.\n\nRobert Corbet was a witness in the instrument or Inquisition made by David, Prince of Cumberland, into the lands belonging to the old Church of Glasgow, and is also a witness in other deeds of David when he was King of Scotland (1124\u201353).\n\n{{quote|The Cumberland or Cumbria of those days extended to the Clyde, and included Glasgow, which David incorporated into Scotland. David appears to have allotted lands in Roxburghshire to Robert Corbet, where his descendants were \"great lords of several generations\". For many centuries the Corbets held lands in the Scottish Borders and were loyal to Scotland. By the late 13th century, the Corbets owned land in the Castle Douglas/ Dalbeattie areas in addition to their traditional tenures. A century later, Constantine Corbet owned lands in Fife and a Walter Corbet owned lands around Lochmaben. By the late 16th century, Corbets owned lands in Clydesdale, with Symont Corbet's will showing land held near Hamilton (1574).|}}\n\nIn 1745 the Corbets supported the British Government. When Bonnie Prince Charlie landed in Scotland. Robert Corbet, then provost of Dumfries, rode out with his men to meet him and warned the Prince to stand aside as Dumfries would have nothing to do with him. He then returned to Dumfries and locked the gates against the Prince.\n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Corbets were busy in Scotland in a variety of occupations, including shipmasters, tanners, tailors, schoolmasters, weavers, etc. In 1784, James Corbett was a weaver in Larkhall and in Hamilton, other Corbetts were prospering in the late 18th century. Janefield, part of the Tollcross estate and now a cemetery, was occupied and farmed by a James Corbett in 1751.\n\nThe Glasgow line of the present-day Corbetts (which includes the present day Lord Rowallan)(see Burke's peerage) descends from Dr Lorimer Corbett (born 1782) who was a well-regarded Glasgow surgeon, himself from a line of medical men. Today's generation of the direct descendants of Dr Lorimer Corbett of Glasgow can trace their lineage to him and his three sons, Robert Telfer, Andrew and Thomas. In 1859 his eldest son, Dr Robert Telfer Corbett, competed for the Regius Chair of Surgery at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Although unsuccessful, he had the honour of losing out to Sir [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], 'the father of modern antisepsis'. In 1864, Robert Telfer Corbett emigrated to New Zealand with his wife and eight children, where many of his descendants now live. Robert Telfer's eldest son was called Lorimer and Lorimer's eldest son was called Robert Lorimer. This eldest son, the grandson of Robert Telfer Corbett and his uncle (named Leech) is associated with the early colonial history of Malaysia. Colonel Robert Lorimer Corbett, CBE, and his brothers Maxwell and Frank were at the forefront of the early tin-mining operations in Ipoh, Malaysia during the early 1900s, owning rubber and coconut plantations there. Robert also had a distinguished military career during the First World War. After the war he settled in England with his family. His children were the last of this line to bear the name ''Corbett'' who could trace their direct lineage back through three generations of elder sons, to Dr. Lorimer Corbett of Glasgow. Many of these descendants now reside in the south of England and Canada. The present Lord Rowallan, John Corbett (b. 1947) who traces his lineage back through Thomas Corbett (b. 1822) the third son of Dr. Lorimer Corbett, resides in Ayrshire, Scotland. (Source: Genealogical research on this has been verified through family records, BMD indexes and original research by M. Learmount daughter of Noreen Corbett and granddaughter of Colonel R.L. Corbett CBE).\n\n==Castles and seats==\n\n*[[Acton Reynald Hall]] is a 19th-century country manor house and park created by the Corbet Family in the 17th century at Acton Reynald, Shropshire, England, and an example of one of the many Corbet Lordships in Shropshire.\n*[[Acton Burnell Castle]] ruins about eight miles Southeast of Shrewsbury, near to the Acton Burnell Church and Hall, claim attention, from the many interesting and historical facts connected with it; it is recorded a Parliament was held here in the year 1283 by Edward I, on which occasion the Lords sat at Shrewsbury, and the Commons in the banqueting hall of the castle here, the gable ends of which still remain; here it was that the statute known by the name of the Acton Burnell Statute or \"Statuta de Mercatoribus (Statutes of Merchants)\" was passed. Long before Edward I, William The Conqueror took the Saxon Godric's manor from him and gave it to the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, who in turn conferred it on Roger Fitz-Corbet. It is supposed that Roger, the Domesday tenant of Actune, was ancestor of those Burnels, from whom afterwards the manor took its distinctive title of Acton Burnell.\n*[[Alberbury Castle]] was built by Fulke Fitz Warine in the 13th century and held under the Barons of Caus, was added protection for Shrewsbury Castle against the threat of the Welsh. In addition, Shropshire was also given a Norman sheriff called Warin who held a number of manors around Oswestry.\n*[[Caus Castle]] (also known as, or recorded in historical documents as Cause; Caurs; Chaus; Caws; Caurse; Alretone; Auretone; Averetonee), often described as a fortress of uncommon strength and extent, is about 2 miles southwest of Westbury, Shropshire, England and is located along the Welsh Marches. Caux Castle was built by Roger Corbet (1066\u20131134) a domesday founder for his family, and is named for his homeland in [[Pays de Caux]], Normandy, France, and was the seat of their [[Marcher Lordships]] granted under Roger de Montgomery (Roger de Montgomeri), Earl of Shrewsbury (Shropshire) and King William the Conqueror.\n*[[Hopton Castle]] is in the [[Hopton Castle, Shropshire|village of the same name]] and is located between Knighton, Powys, Wales and Craven Arms (Newton), Shropshire, England. Hopton Castle passed by marriage to the Moreton Corbet family in the 15th century.\n*[[High Ercall Hall]] & High Ercall Church (pronounced High Arcal) in the borough of Telford & Wrekin, were owned by the Corbets by marriage to the Newport's.\n*[[Longnor Hall]] A 17th-century manor house built by the Corbets in the Shropshire village of Longnor. The hall displays the Corbet crow arms on its gable end.\n*[[Moreton Corbet Castle]] in Shropshire, England was acquired by the Corbets in 1235, when Sir Richard Corbet of Wettlesborough b. 1191, who married Joan Thoreton b. 1200 the daughter or Bartholomew Thoreton of Moreton Thoret. Sometime around 1560 Sir Andrew Corbet rebuilt the castle and built a new east range with a great hall, to this was added an ornate south range designed in a L-shape by Sir Andrew's son, Robert Corbet. It is this latter addition that stands as one of the landmarks in English architectural history.\n*[[Rowallan Castle]] was the seat for later chiefs of the Corbets which was originally the seat of the chiefs of [[Clan Muir]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theclanmuir.org/Rowallan_castle.htm | title=Rowallan Castle Ancestral Home of Clan Muir | publisher=Clan Muir|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.old-picture.com/europe/Kilmarnock-Rowallan-Scotland-Castle.htm | title=Rowallan Castle, Kilmarnock, Scotland | publisher=old-picture.com |accessdate=2009-05-25 }}</ref>\n*[[Sibdon Castle]] in Sibdon Carwood, near Newton, Shropshire, England. The fortified manor at [[Sibdon Carwood]], the predecessor to the 17th-century Sibdon Castle country house, is given the name \"Shepeton Corbet\" by a number of historical documents, including that of John Leland (c. 1535\u201343), who also gives the suffix to [[Hopton Castle|Hopton Corbet Castle]] and Moreton Corbet Castle. This is an indication that the Corbet family owned these fortified manors around the time, of which Moreton Corbet's castle both remains in their ownership and retains the suffix to this day.\n*[[Sundorne Castle]] is home of the Corbet-Pigott family\n*[[Wattlesborough Castle]] was a fortified manor held by the Barons of Caus, which later passed from the Corbets to the John de Mowthe Family.\n*[[Siston]], Gloucestershire, which branch died out in the late 14th century. The arms of Corbet of Siston continued to be quartered by the Denys family of Siston, which inherited the Corbet estates by marriage, although no children resulted.\n\n==Armorials==\n[[File:CorbetBaronetsOfMoretonCorbetArms.JPG|thumb|150px|Arms of [[Corbet baronets]] of Moreton Corbet, cr. 1808: ''Or, a raven sable''<ref>Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 204.</ref>]]\n[[File:ArmsOfCorbetOfChadesleyCorbet.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Arms of Corbet of [[Chaddesley Corbett]]: ''Or a raven proper within a bordure engrailed gules.''<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/generalarmoryofe00burk#page/228/mode/2up Burke's General Armory, p. 228.]</ref>]]\n\n[[File:ArmsCorbetofSiston&Hope.jpg|thumb|150px|Arms of Corbet of [[Siston]], Glos. & Hope, Salop.: ''Argent, a raven proper within a bordure sable [[bezant]]ee''.
