From an old [[Virginia]] family, as a young man Coles was a neighbor and associate of presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], as well as secretary to President [[James Madison]] (1810 to 1815).\n\nAn anti-slavery advocate throughout his adult life, Coles inherited a plantation and slaves but eventually left Virginia for the [[Illinois Territory]] in order to set his slaves free. He [[Manumission|manumitted]] 19 slaves in 1819, and acquired land for them. In [[Illinois]], he twice led political campaigns that prevented the legitimization of slavery in the new state. Coles corresponded with and advised both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to free their slaves.

However, for years he received no reasonable offers, and so continued to operate it through an overseer.

His great-grandfather, Walter Coles, had been a customs officer in Ireland who moved to what became [[Richmond, Virginia]] and made his fortune as a merchant. His grandfather John had been one of the petitioners requesting that Richmond be recognized as a new town, and continued to develop the family's business and social ties through marriage to the youngest daughter of [[Quaker]] merchant Isaac Winston.

[[James Monroe]] owned [[Ash Lawn-Highland]] plantation on the other side of Green Mountain for 24 years (until forced to sell it in 1825 due to financial problems), and offered young Coles use of his library, although the relationship with this family was more distant since Monroe split his time at [[Oak Hill (James Monroe House)|Oak Hill]] plantation in [[Loudoun County]].\n\nIsaac managed and ultimately inherited Enniscorthy, subject to a life estate held by his mother (who died in 1826).

The fear of appearing presumptuous distresses me, and would deter me from venturing thus to call your attention to a subject of such magnitude, and so beset with difficulties, as that of a general emancipation of the Slaves of Virginia, had I not the highest opinion of your goodness and liberality, in not only excusing me for the liberty I take, but in justly appreciating my motives in doing so.\n\nI will not enter on the right which man has to enslave his Brother man, nor upon the moral and political effects of Slavery on individuals or on Society; because these things are better understood by you than by me. My object is to entreat and beseech you to exert your knowledge and influence, in devising, and getting into operation, some plan for the gradual emancipation of Slavery. This difficult task could be less exceptionably, and more successfully performed by the revered Fathers of all our political and social blessings, than by any succeeding statesmen; and would seem to come with peculiar propriety and force from those whose valor wisdom and virtue have done so much in meliorating the condition of mankind. And it is a duty, as I conceive, that devolves particularly on you, from your known philosophical and enlarged view of subjects, and from the principles you have professed and practiced through a long and useful life, preeminently distinguished, as well by being foremost in establishing on the broadest basis the rights of man, and the liberty and independence of your Country, as in being throughout honored with the most important trusts by your fellow-citizens, whose confidence and love you have carried with you into the shades of old age and retirement. In the calm of this retirement you might, most beneficially to society, and with much addition to your own fame, avail yourself of that love and confidence to put into complete practice those hallowed principles contained in that renowned Declaration, of which you were the immortal author, and on which we bottomed our right to resist oppression, and establish our freedom and independence.\n\nI hope that the fear of failing, at this time, will have no influence in preventing you from employing your pen to eradicate this most degrading feature of British Colonial policy, which is still permitted to exist, notwithstanding its repugnance as well to the principles of our revolution as to our free Institutions. For however highly prized and influential your opinions may now be, they will be still much more so when you shall have been snatched from us by the course of nature. If therefore your attempt should now fail to rectify this unfortunate evil\u2014an evil most injurious both to the oppressed and to the oppressor\u2014at some future day when your memory will be consecrated by a grateful posterity, what influence, irresistible influence will the opinions and writings of Thomas Jefferson have on all questions connected with the rights of man, and of that policy which will be the creed of your disciples. Permit me then, my dear Sir, again to intreat you to exert your great powers of mind and influence, and to employ some of your present leisure, in devising a mode to liberate one half of our Fellowbeings from an ignominious bondage to the other; either by making an immediate attempt to put in train a plan to commence this goodly work, or to leave human Nature the invaluable Testament\u2014which you are so capable of doing\u2014how best to establish its rights: So that the weight of your opinion may be on the side of emancipation when that question shall be agitated, and that it will be sooner or later is most certain\u2014That it may be soon is my most ardent prayer\u2014that it will be rests with you.\n\nI will only add, as an excuse for the liberty I take in addressing you on this subject, which is so particularly interesting to me; that from the time I was capable of reflecting on the nature of political society, and of the rights appertaining to Man, I have not only been principled against Slavery, but have had feelings so repugnant to it, as to decide me not to hold them; which decision has forced me to leave my native state, and with it all my relations and friends. This I hope will be deemed by you some excuse for the liberty of this intrusion, of which I gladly avail myself to assure you of the very great respect and esteem with which I am, my dear Sir, your every sincere and devoted friend\n\n:''Edward Coles''\n\n----\n\n<br /><center>''Thomas Jefferson'' to ''Edward Coles''<br />August 25, 1814<br />Monticello</center><br />\nDEAR SIR,-- Your favour of July 31, was duly received, and was read with peculiar pleasure. The sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to both the head and heart of the writer. Mine on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since been in possession of the public, and time has only served to give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear not much serious willingness to relieve them & ourselves from our present condition of moral & political reprobation. From those of the former generation who were in the fulness of age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that degradation was very much the work of themselves & their fathers, few minds have yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their horses and cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial life has been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the value of liberty. And when alarm was taken at an enterprize on their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of the principles which they invoked for themselves. In the first or second session of the Legislature after I became a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of the oldest, ablest, & most respected members, and he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the laws to these people. I seconded his motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared in the debate; but he was denounced as an enemy of his country, & was treated with the grossest indecorum. From an early stage of our revolution other & more distant duties were assigned to me, so that from that time till my return from Europe in 1789, and I may say till I returned to reside at home in 1809, I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this subject. I had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast, & had become as it were the vital spirit of every American, that the generous temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice, would have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and proved their love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But my intercourse with them, since my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the progress I had hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first which has brought this sound to my ear; and I have considered the general silence which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope. Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds; or by the bloody process of St Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within our Country, and offering asylum & arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over. As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition so expedient on the whole, as that as emancipation of those born after a given day, and of their education and expatriation after a given age. This would give time for a gradual extinction of that species of labour & substitution of another, and lessen the severity of the shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce. For men probably of any color, but of this color we know, brought from their infancy without necessity for thought or forecast, are by their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking care of themselves, and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising young. In the meantime they are pests in society by their idleness, and the depredations to which this leads them. Their amalgamation with the other color produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character can innocently consent. I am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work. But this, my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of Hector \"trementibus aequo humeris et inutile ferruncingi.\" No, I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors & perils begat mutual confidence and influence. This enterprise is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it through to its consummation. It shall have all my prayers, & these are the only weapons of an old man. But in the meantime are you right in abandoning this property, and your country with it? I think not. My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them, we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from all ill usage, require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen, & be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them, and our duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their good: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot control. I hope then, my dear sir, you will reconcile yourself to your country and its unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen its stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass. That, on the contrary you will come forward in the public councils, become the missionary of this doctrine truly Christian; insinuate & inculcate it softly but steadily, through the medium of writing and conversation; associate others in your labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on and press the proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment. It is an encouraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed, which, if duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end. We have proof of this in the history of the endeavors in the English parliament to suppress that very trade which brought this evil on us. And you will be supported by the religious precept, \"be not weary in well-doing.\" That your success may be as speedy & complete, as it will be of honorable & immortal consolation to yourself, I shall as fervently and sincerely pray as I assure you of my great friendship and respect. <br />\n::''Thomas Jefferson''\n<br/>\n----\n<br />\n<center>''Edward Coles'' to ''Thomas Jefferson''<br />September 26, 1814<br />Washington</center>\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must be permitted again to trouble you, my dear Sir, to return my grateful thanks for the respectful and friendly attention shown to my letter in your answer of the 25th ulto. Your favorable reception of sentiments not generally avowed if felt by our Countrymen, but which have ever been so inseparably interwoven with my opinions and feelings as to become as it were the rudder that shapes my course even against a strong tide of interest and of local partialities, could not but be in the highest degree gratifying to me. And your interesting and highly prized letter, conveying them to me in such flattering terms, would have been called forth my acknowledgments before this but for its having been forwarded to me to the Springs, and from thence it was again returned here before I received it, which was only a few days since.\n\nYour indulgent treatment encourages me to add\u2014that I feel very sensibly the force of your remarks on the impropriety of yielding to my repugnancies in abandoning my property in Slaves and my native State. I certainly should never have been inclined to yield to them if I had supposed myself capable of being instrumental in bringing about a liberation, or that I could by my example meliorate the condition of these oppressed people. If I could be convinced of being in the slightest degree useful in doing either, it would afford me very great happiness, and the more so as it would enable me to gratify many partialities by remaining in Virginia. But never having flattered myself with the hope of being able to contribute to either, I have long since determined, and should, but for my bad health ere this, have removed, carrying along with me those who had been my Slaves, to the Country North West of the river Ohio.\n\nYour prayers I trust will not only be heard with indulgence in Heaven, but with influence on earth. But I cannot agree with you that they are the only weapons of one at your age, nor that the difficult work of cleansing the escutchion of Virginia of the foul stain of slavery can best be done by the young. To effect so great and difficult an object great and extensive powers both of mind and influence are required, which can never be possessed in so great a degree by the young as by the old. And among the few of the former who might unite the disposition with the re-quisite capacity, they are too often led by ambitious views to go with the current of popular feeing, rather than to mark out a course for themselves, where they might be buffetted by the waves of opposition; and indeed it is feared these waves would in this case be too strong to be effectually resisted, by any but those who had gained by a previous course of useful employment the firmest footing in the confidence and attachment of their Country. It is with them, therefore, I am persuaded, that the subject of emancipation must originate; for they are the only persons who have it in their power effectually to arouse and enlighten the public sentiment, which in matters of this kind ought not to be expected to lead but to be led; nor ought it to be wondered at that there should prevail a degree of apathy with the general mass of mankind, where a mere passive principle of right has to contend against the weighty influence of habit and interest. On such a question there will always exist in society a kind of vis inertia, to arouse and overcome which require a strong impulse, which can only be given by those who have acquired a great weight of character, and on whom there devolves in this case a most solemn obligation. It was under these impressions that I looked to you, my dear sir, as the first of our aged worthies, to awaken our fellow Citizens from their infatuation to a proper sense of Justice and to the true interest of their country, and by proposing a system for the gradual emancipation of our Slaves, at once to form a rallying point for its friends, who enlightened by your wisdom and experience, and supported and encouraged by your sanction and patronage, might look forward to a propitious and happy result. Your time of life I had not considered as an obstacle to the undertaking. Doctor Franklin, to whom, by the way, Pennsylvania owes her early riddance of the evils of Slavery, was as actively and as usefully employed on as arduous duties after he had past your age as he had ever been at any period of his life.\n\nWith apologizing for having give you so much trouble on this subject, and again repeating my thanks for the respectful and flattering attention you have been pleased to pay to it, I renew the assurances of the great respect and regard which makes me most sincerely\n\n:Yours\n\n:''Edward Coles'' \n{{refend}}\n|}\n</div>\n\n===Illinois===\nIn the fall of 1817, Coles sold his plantation to his eldest brother Walter, having declined James Monroe's request that he continue as the new President's private secretary. Instead, Coles embarked on a second reconnaissance mission to the Northwest Territories (1818). He bought land in the [[American Bottom]] in Illinois Territory. Coles also participated in the Illinois Constitutional Convention at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] after Indiana became a state. Coles worked with [[Baptist]] [[John Mason Peck]], [[Methodist]] [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]], [[Quaker]] [[James Lemen]], and publisher [[Hooper Warren]] to successfully oppose a faction that wanted to legitimize slavery in the new territory's constitution.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.38-39</ref><ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] pp.10-11</ref><ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] pp. 62-74</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc14.html |title=Chapter 14: Second Trip to Illinois |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes then returned to Virginia, planning to display his deep moral objections to slavery and finally [[manumit]] the slaves he inherited from his father after leaving the Commonwealth. In late March 1819, having collected the final payment from Walter, Edward Coles was ready to move to the Illinois Territory. President Monroe had appointed him Register of Lands for the new territory, with an office at [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]].<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 57-58.</ref>\n\nColes sent his trusted slave (and travel companion during his previous Northwest Territory trips) Ralph Crawford with wagons and 16 other slaves (total 6 adults and 11 children) ahead on the [[Great Wagon Road]] north to Pennsylvania. To the derision of many family and friends, Coles had let the slaves ride on ahead, none of them knowing his plans to free them at that time.<ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] p.12</ref> Coles traveled separately. They met at [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], where the party boarded a pair of [[flatboats]] and began a water-bound journey: floating on the [[Monongahela River]]  north to Pittsburgh, then west along the [[Ohio River]] toward Illinois.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 59-64.</ref> Coles selected a point west of Pittsburgh to announce to his slaves their immediate freedom and also his plan to provide land to each head of a family.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 64-70.</ref><ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.47-49</ref><ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.110</ref> Coles captured the scene in an autobiographical piece written some 25 years later.<ref>Document:\"The Emancipation of the Slaves of Edward Coles.\" October 1827, Folder 21, Box 3, Coles Family Papers, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</ref> Decades later, the river emancipation became the subject of a mural in the first floor (south hall) of the [[Illinois State Capitol]].<ref>https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evr7069mets.xml</ref>\n\nThe Coles party arrived in Edwardsville, early in May 1819, and Coles began his service as Register of Lands.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.44-46</ref> He also completed the manumission process by purchasing land so as to give each freed head of family {{convert|160|acre|km2}}.<ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.259</ref> Coles also provided employment and other ongoing support for those he had freed.

Browne]] (the eventual candidate of the [[Ninian Edwards]] faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, \"As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc19.html |title=Chapter 19: Governor Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes\u2019 inaugural address included a clear call for the end of slavery in Illinois and revision of the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Code]], as well as advocated internal improvements (especially a canal link to the Great Lakes) and aid to agriculture and education.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.238-239</ref> Slavery was a very important topic at the time, because that first state constitution only permitted current practices using slave labor in the salines (salt evaporation factories) through 1825. A proslavery faction had hoped to eliminate the first constitution's anti-slavery clause and transform Illinois into a slave state like Missouri. Coles\u2019 bold call for an end to slavery stiffened their resolve and led to a rancorous legislative effort which began with the Shaw-Hansen Affair (concerning whether to seat a pro-slavery candidate backed by voters who came from Missouri, or his anti-slavery opponent).<ref>Document:\"The Shaw-Hansen Election Contest.\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society.

After the bill passed, Coles committed his total pay as governor ($4000) to defeat the referendum, and led a committee of anti-slavery citizens, religious leaders, and legislators (who committed another $1000). The aristocratic, awkward Virginian and his allies then dispelled a plethora of false economic arguments spread by slavery proponents, while in the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1819]] keeping secret their printing help from much-reviled Philadelphians ([[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] and [[Roberts Vaux]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/edwardcoles.html |title=Narrative of the Life of Edward Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> The 18-month political struggle used committees in each county as well as traveling preachers.\n\nOn August 2, 1824, Illinois voters rejected the pro-slavery convention referendum (as well as re-elected anti-slavery U.S. representative [[Daniel Pope Cook]]). However, by year's end pro-slavery legislators refused to approve Coles' appointment of his anti-slavery friend Morris Birkbeck as secretary of state. Furthermore, lieutenant governor Adolphus Hubbard attempted to wrest the governorship away from Coles during his trip to Virginia in late 1825, causing additional confusion, although Hubbard also lost the gubernatorial election the next year to [[Ninian Edwards]] (the state Constitution also included a provision modelled on Virginia's which precluded governors from running for reelection).<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 141-143</ref> Finally, a lawsuit that political opponents in [[Madison County, Illinois]] brought against Coles for failing to pay a slave tax on his freed slaves years earlier took several more years, including shenanigans by pro-slavery judge [[Samuel McRoberts]], before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] ruled such payment unnecessary.<ref>citing Alvord, Governor Edward Coles (Illinois State Historical Society, 1920) at pp. 210-213.</ref> Coles' valedictory speech as governor in December 1826 reminded legislators of his previous speeches urging them to abolish slavery and its remnants (especially heritability) in the new state, as well as to finance a canal to the Great Lakes watershed and a penitentiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc25.html |title=Chapter 25 : The Result |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nAfter his term as governor expired, Coles returned briefly to Virginia, where his mother had died that spring. Coles then returned to his farm outside of Edwardsville. He focused on agricultural and business pursuits, between continued trips to Virginia and Philadelphia to visit family and friends and to search for a wife. His friend [[Daniel Pope Cook]] was defeated by a proslavery opponent in 1826, and legislators had selected their pro-slavery speaker [[John McLean (Illinois politician)|John McLean]] to fill unexpired U.S. Senate terms in 1824 and 1829 (voters ultimately electing [[Elias Kent Kane]] and [[John McCracken Robinson]] to those seats). Coles made his last run for public office in 1831. As candidate for Congress, running against eight candidates including pro-slavery Democrats Joseph Duncan (allied with Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]]) and Sidney Breese (a [[Jacksonian Democrat]]), Coles polled a distant third.<ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] p.271</ref> He had been out of public view for some years, and refused to align himself with any political party. Instead, Coles campaigned on his successful term as governor, proclaimed his association with the founding fathers, and criticized the Jacksonian platform. Still, Coles felt devastated by the political defeat, and moved back east.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 146-149</ref> Nonetheless, in 1835, Illinois legislators authorized Coles to sell bonds to finance his canal project, but since they also refused to back the bonds with state credit, sales proved slow.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc26.html |title=Chapter 26: The Rest of a Life |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Back to Virginia===\nWorried about his unmarried status and increasing partisanship, Coles decided to leave Illinois shortly after his election loss. He made another trip to Virginia, which was involved in its own debate over slavery after [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion. After Turner's execution, Coles wrote [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] urging emancipation and colonization to prevent further disasters, stressing that slavery restricted Virginia's economic development.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 152-153.</ref> At year's end, while visiting James and Dolley Madison at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], Madison confided in Coles his wish to manumit his own slaves and asked Coles about his experiences as he tried to find the right way to accomplish this while still  providing for Dolley as his widow. However, Madison died in 1836 without freeing any of his slaves which were left in a will to his wife Dolley.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp.161-162</ref><ref>Document:Edward Coles to James Madison, January 8, 1832, folder 30, box 1, E. Coles Papers, Princeton University Library.</ref>\n\n==Later life in Philadelphia==\nColes moved to Philadelphia in 1832, gratified by its active social and intellectual life, as well as slavery's absence. At age 46, Coles married prominent socialite Sally Logan Roberts (1809 to 1883) on November 28, 1833. The couple had three children: Mary Coles, Edward Coles, Jr., and Roberts Coles. Sally Coles inherited significant property upon her father's death, but it (and much of Coles' own fortune) was devastated by the [[Panic of 1837]]. Furthermore, his family's renovated Enniscorthy plantation burned down in 1839, and his elder brother Isaac only survived the disasters by two years.<ref name=\"virginia1\"/> Coles's last public appointment was in 1841, when he served on a committee investigating the U.S. Bank, which ultimately led to the resignation of his friend Nicholas Biddle.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\"/> Coles unsuccessfully sought political appointments from his Virginia classmates who had become high federal officials, [[John Tyler]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Still, rental income from real estate investments (widely spread geographically) kept the growing family financially comfortable. Coles and his young family travelled often to visit his extended family and properties in Virginia and Washington, D.C., as well as Illinois and later [[Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey]].\n\nHowever, Coles never resumed his political career, uncomfortable with the new party system. Nonetheless, he rejoiced when [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom he remembered as a young Illinois lawyer, was elected President. The elderly ex-governor briefly met the newly elected president on his journey to Washington.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 201-203</ref> Coles had also publicly taken exception to Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' characterization of slavery's history in Illinois during the [[Kansas-Nebraska]] debate of 1854.\n\nColes turned to history during his later years. He was recognized as one of the few remaining men with close personal knowledge of both Madison and Jefferson, and burnished their reputations as champions of the republican ideals that had also motivated Coles during his entire life.<ref>Document:Guasco, Suzanne Cooper. \"Managing Memory: The Cultivation of Elite Authority in Jacksonian America.\" paper presentation, annual conference, Society for Historians of the Early American Republic (SHEAR) Conference, Buffalo, NY July 20\u201323, 2000.</ref> Coles had lobbied both Jefferson and Madison (and later [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]) to free their slaves. Coles was surprised when Madison failed to do so, only later learning that lawyer [[Robert Taylor (congressman)|Robert Taylor]] had persuaded the former President to leave emancipation instructions for his widow, whose father had gone bankrupt after freeing his slaves many years earlier. Dolley, with other personal economic priorities (especially a son addicted to gambling), freed no slaves upon her death in 1849.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 160-166.</ref> Coles also wrote about the [[Northwest Ordinance]].

Coles also lived to see his elder son and namesake, Edward Coles, Jr., marry Elizabeth (Bessie) Mason Campbell, relative of anti-slavery founding father [[George Mason]] (descendant of his younger brother [[Thomson Mason]]) on February 25, 1868. Edward Coles Jr. became a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia, and a long-time vestry member of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]], which still displays a plaque honoring his service on the south wall inside the nave.\n\nThe Coles family grave at [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodlands Cemetery]] in west Philadelphia includes the final resting places of the former governor, his wife Sally, as well as their three children.

From an old [[Virginia]] family, as a young man Coles was a neighbor and associate of presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], as well as secretary to President [[James Madison]] (1810 to 1815).\n\nAn anti-slavery advocate throughout his adult life, Coles inherited a plantation and slaves but eventually left Virginia for the [[Illinois Territory]] in order to set his slaves free. He [[Manumission|manumitted]] 19 slaves in 1819, and acquired land for them. In [[Illinois]], he twice led political campaigns that prevented the legitimization of slavery in the new state. Coles corresponded with and advised both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to free their slaves.

The fear of appearing presumptuous distresses me, and would deter me from venturing thus to call your attention to a subject of such magnitude, and so beset with difficulties, as that of a general emancipation of the Slaves of Virginia, had I not the highest opinion of your goodness and liberality, in not only excusing me for the liberty I take, but in justly appreciating my motives in doing so.\n\nI will not enter on the right which man has to enslave his Brother man, nor upon the moral and political effects of Slavery on individuals or on Society; because these things are better understood by you than by me. My object is to entreat and beseech you to exert your knowledge and influence, in devising, and getting into operation, some plan for the gradual emancipation of Slavery. This difficult task could be less exceptionably, and more successfully performed by the revered Fathers of all our political and social blessings, than by any succeeding statesmen; and would seem to come with peculiar propriety and force from those whose valor wisdom and virtue have done so much in meliorating the condition of mankind. And it is a duty, as I conceive, that devolves particularly on you, from your known philosophical and enlarged view of subjects, and from the principles you have professed and practiced through a long and useful life, preeminently distinguished, as well by being foremost in establishing on the broadest basis the rights of man, and the liberty and independence of your Country, as in being throughout honored with the most important trusts by your fellow-citizens, whose confidence and love you have carried with you into the shades of old age and retirement. In the calm of this retirement you might, most beneficially to society, and with much addition to your own fame, avail yourself of that love and confidence to put into complete practice those hallowed principles contained in that renowned Declaration, of which you were the immortal author, and on which we bottomed our right to resist oppression, and establish our freedom and independence.\n\nI hope that the fear of failing, at this time, will have no influence in preventing you from employing your pen to eradicate this most degrading feature of British Colonial policy, which is still permitted to exist, notwithstanding its repugnance as well to the principles of our revolution as to our free Institutions. For however highly prized and influential your opinions may now be, they will be still much more so when you shall have been snatched from us by the course of nature. If therefore your attempt should now fail to rectify this unfortunate evil\u2014an evil most injurious both to the oppressed and to the oppressor\u2014at some future day when your memory will be consecrated by a grateful posterity, what influence, irresistible influence will the opinions and writings of Thomas Jefferson have on all questions connected with the rights of man, and of that policy which will be the creed of your disciples. Permit me then, my dear Sir, again to intreat you to exert your great powers of mind and influence, and to employ some of your present leisure, in devising a mode to liberate one half of our Fellowbeings from an ignominious bondage to the other; either by making an immediate attempt to put in train a plan to commence this goodly work, or to leave human Nature the invaluable Testament\u2014which you are so capable of doing\u2014how best to establish its rights: So that the weight of your opinion may be on the side of emancipation when that question shall be agitated, and that it will be sooner or later is most certain\u2014That it may be soon is my most ardent prayer\u2014that it will be rests with you.\n\nI will only add, as an excuse for the liberty I take in addressing you on this subject, which is so particularly interesting to me; that from the time I was capable of reflecting on the nature of political society, and of the rights appertaining to Man, I have not only been principled against Slavery, but have had feelings so repugnant to it, as to decide me not to hold them; which decision has forced me to leave my native state, and with it all my relations and friends. This I hope will be deemed by you some excuse for the liberty of this intrusion, of which I gladly avail myself to assure you of the very great respect and esteem with which I am, my dear Sir, your every sincere and devoted friend\n\n:''Edward Coles''\n\n----\n\n<br /><center>''Thomas Jefferson'' to ''Edward Coles''<br />August 25, 1814<br />Monticello</center><br />\nDEAR SIR,-- Your favour of July 31, was duly received, and was read with peculiar pleasure. The sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to both the head and heart of the writer. Mine on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since been in possession of the public, and time has only served to give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear not much serious willingness to relieve them & ourselves from our present condition of moral & political reprobation. From those of the former generation who were in the fulness of age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that degradation was very much the work of themselves & their fathers, few minds have yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their horses and cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial life has been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the value of liberty. And when alarm was taken at an enterprize on their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of the principles which they invoked for themselves. In the first or second session of the Legislature after I became a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of the oldest, ablest, & most respected members, and he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the laws to these people. I seconded his motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared in the debate; but he was denounced as an enemy of his country, & was treated with the grossest indecorum. From an early stage of our revolution other & more distant duties were assigned to me, so that from that time till my return from Europe in 1789, and I may say till I returned to reside at home in 1809, I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this subject. I had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast, & had become as it were the vital spirit of every American, that the generous temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice, would have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and proved their love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But my intercourse with them, since my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the progress I had hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first which has brought this sound to my ear; and I have considered the general silence which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope. Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds; or by the bloody process of St Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within our Country, and offering asylum & arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over. As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition so expedient on the whole, as that as emancipation of those born after a given day, and of their education and expatriation after a given age. This would give time for a gradual extinction of that species of labour & substitution of another, and lessen the severity of the shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce. For men probably of any color, but of this color we know, brought from their infancy without necessity for thought or forecast, are by their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking care of themselves, and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising young. In the meantime they are pests in society by their idleness, and the depredations to which this leads them. Their amalgamation with the other color produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character can innocently consent. I am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work. But this, my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of Hector \"trementibus aequo humeris et inutile ferruncingi.\" No, I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors & perils begat mutual confidence and influence. This enterprise is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it through to its consummation. It shall have all my prayers, & these are the only weapons of an old man. But in the meantime are you right in abandoning this property, and your country with it? I think not. My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them, we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from all ill usage, require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen, & be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them, and our duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their good: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot control. I hope then, my dear sir, you will reconcile yourself to your country and its unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen its stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass. That, on the contrary you will come forward in the public councils, become the missionary of this doctrine truly Christian; insinuate & inculcate it softly but steadily, through the medium of writing and conversation; associate others in your labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on and press the proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment. It is an encouraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed, which, if duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end. We have proof of this in the history of the endeavors in the English parliament to suppress that very trade which brought this evil on us. And you will be supported by the religious precept, \"be not weary in well-doing.\" That your success may be as speedy & complete, as it will be of honorable & immortal consolation to yourself, I shall as fervently and sincerely pray as I assure you of my great friendship and respect. <br />\n::''Thomas Jefferson''\n<br/>\n----\n<br />\n<center>''Edward Coles'' to ''Thomas Jefferson''<br />September 26, 1814<br />Washington</center>\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must be permitted again to trouble you, my dear Sir, to return my grateful thanks for the respectful and friendly attention shown to my letter in your answer of the 25th ulto. Your favorable reception of sentiments not generally avowed if felt by our Countrymen, but which have ever been so inseparably interwoven with my opinions and feelings as to become as it were the rudder that shapes my course even against a strong tide of interest and of local partialities, could not but be in the highest degree gratifying to me. And your interesting and highly prized letter, conveying them to me in such flattering terms, would have been called forth my acknowledgments before this but for its having been forwarded to me to the Springs, and from thence it was again returned here before I received it, which was only a few days since.\n\nYour indulgent treatment encourages me to add\u2014that I feel very sensibly the force of your remarks on the impropriety of yielding to my repugnancies in abandoning my property in Slaves and my native State. I certainly should never have been inclined to yield to them if I had supposed myself capable of being instrumental in bringing about a liberation, or that I could by my example meliorate the condition of these oppressed people. If I could be convinced of being in the slightest degree useful in doing either, it would afford me very great happiness, and the more so as it would enable me to gratify many partialities by remaining in Virginia. But never having flattered myself with the hope of being able to contribute to either, I have long since determined, and should, but for my bad health ere this, have removed, carrying along with me those who had been my Slaves, to the Country North West of the river Ohio.\n\nYour prayers I trust will not only be heard with indulgence in Heaven, but with influence on earth. But I cannot agree with you that they are the only weapons of one at your age, nor that the difficult work of cleansing the escutchion of Virginia of the foul stain of slavery can best be done by the young. To effect so great and difficult an object great and extensive powers both of mind and influence are required, which can never be possessed in so great a degree by the young as by the old. And among the few of the former who might unite the disposition with the re-quisite capacity, they are too often led by ambitious views to go with the current of popular feeing, rather than to mark out a course for themselves, where they might be buffetted by the waves of opposition; and indeed it is feared these waves would in this case be too strong to be effectually resisted, by any but those who had gained by a previous course of useful employment the firmest footing in the confidence and attachment of their Country. It is with them, therefore, I am persuaded, that the subject of emancipation must originate; for they are the only persons who have it in their power effectually to arouse and enlighten the public sentiment, which in matters of this kind ought not to be expected to lead but to be led; nor ought it to be wondered at that there should prevail a degree of apathy with the general mass of mankind, where a mere passive principle of right has to contend against the weighty influence of habit and interest. On such a question there will always exist in society a kind of vis inertia, to arouse and overcome which require a strong impulse, which can only be given by those who have acquired a great weight of character, and on whom there devolves in this case a most solemn obligation. It was under these impressions that I looked to you, my dear sir, as the first of our aged worthies, to awaken our fellow Citizens from their infatuation to a proper sense of Justice and to the true interest of their country, and by proposing a system for the gradual emancipation of our Slaves, at once to form a rallying point for its friends, who enlightened by your wisdom and experience, and supported and encouraged by your sanction and patronage, might look forward to a propitious and happy result. Your time of life I had not considered as an obstacle to the undertaking. Doctor Franklin, to whom, by the way, Pennsylvania owes her early riddance of the evils of Slavery, was as actively and as usefully employed on as arduous duties after he had past your age as he had ever been at any period of his life.\n\nWith apologizing for having give you so much trouble on this subject, and again repeating my thanks for the respectful and flattering attention you have been pleased to pay to it, I renew the assurances of the great respect and regard which makes me most sincerely\n\n:Yours\n\n:''Edward Coles'' \n{{refend}}\n|}\n</div>\n\n===Illinois===\nIn the fall of 1817, Coles sold his plantation to his eldest brother Walter, having declined James Monroe's request that he continue as the new President's private secretary. Instead, Coles embarked on a second reconnaissance mission to the Northwest Territories (1818). He bought land in the [[American Bottom]] in Illinois Territory. Coles also participated in the Illinois Constitutional Convention at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] after Indiana became a state. Coles worked with [[Baptist]] [[John Mason Peck]], [[Methodist]] [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]], [[Quaker]] [[James Lemen]], and publisher [[Hooper Warren]] to successfully oppose a faction that wanted to legitimize slavery in the new territory's constitution.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.38-39</ref><ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] pp.10-11</ref><ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] pp. 62-74</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc14.html |title=Chapter 14: Second Trip to Illinois |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes then returned to Virginia, planning to display his deep moral objections to slavery and finally [[manumit]] the slaves he inherited from his father after leaving the Commonwealth. In late March 1819, having collected the final payment from Walter, Edward Coles was ready to move to the Illinois Territory. President Monroe had appointed him Register of Lands for the new territory, with an office at [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]].<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 57-58.</ref>\n\nColes sent his trusted slave (and travel companion during his previous Northwest Territory trips) Ralph Crawford with wagons and 16 other slaves (total 6 adults and 11 children) ahead on the [[Great Wagon Road]] north to Pennsylvania. To the derision of many family and friends, Coles had let the slaves ride on ahead, none of them knowing his plans to free them at that time.<ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] p.12</ref> Coles traveled separately. They met at [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], where the party boarded a pair of [[flatboats]] and began a water-bound journey: floating on the [[Monongahela River]]  north to Pittsburgh, then west along the [[Ohio River]] toward Illinois.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 59-64.</ref> Coles selected a point west of Pittsburgh to announce to his slaves their immediate freedom and also his plan to provide land to each head of a family.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 64-70.</ref><ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.47-49</ref><ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.110</ref> Coles captured the scene in an autobiographical piece written some 25 years later.<ref>Document:\"The Emancipation of the Slaves of Edward Coles.\" October 1827, Folder 21, Box 3, Coles Family Papers, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</ref> Decades later, the river emancipation became the subject of a mural in the first floor (south hall) of the [[Illinois State Capitol]].<ref>https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evr7069mets.xml</ref>\n\nThe Coles party arrived in Edwardsville, early in May 1819, and Coles began his service as Register of Lands.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.44-46</ref> He also completed the manumission process by purchasing land so as to give each freed head of family {{convert|160|acre|km2}}.<ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.259</ref> Coles also provided employment and other ongoing support for those he had freed.

Browne]] (the eventual candidate of the [[Ninian Edwards]] faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, \"As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc19.html |title=Chapter 19: Governor Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes\u2019 inaugural address included a clear call for the end of slavery in Illinois and revision of the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Code]], as well as advocated internal improvements (especially a canal link to the Great Lakes) and aid to agriculture and education.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.238-239</ref> Slavery was a very important topic at the time, because that first state constitution only permitted current practices using slave labor in the salines (salt evaporation factories) through 1825. A proslavery faction had hoped to eliminate the first constitution's anti-slavery clause and transform Illinois into a slave state like Missouri. Coles\u2019 bold call for an end to slavery stiffened their resolve and led to a rancorous legislative effort which began with the Shaw-Hansen Affair (concerning whether to seat a pro-slavery candidate backed by voters who came from Missouri, or his anti-slavery opponent).<ref>Document:\"The Shaw-Hansen Election Contest.\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society.

After the bill passed, Coles committed his total pay as governor ($4000) to defeat the referendum, and led a committee of anti-slavery citizens, religious leaders, and legislators (who committed another $1000). The aristocratic, awkward Virginian and his allies then dispelled a plethora of false economic arguments spread by slavery proponents, while in the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1819]] keeping secret their printing help from much-reviled Philadelphians ([[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] and [[Roberts Vaux]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/edwardcoles.html |title=Narrative of the Life of Edward Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> The 18-month political struggle used committees in each county as well as traveling preachers.\n\nOn August 2, 1824, Illinois voters rejected the pro-slavery convention referendum (as well as re-elected anti-slavery U.S. representative [[Daniel Pope Cook]]). However, by year's end pro-slavery legislators refused to approve Coles' appointment of his anti-slavery friend Morris Birkbeck as secretary of state. Furthermore, lieutenant governor Adolphus Hubbard attempted to wrest the governorship away from Coles during his trip to Virginia in late 1825, causing additional confusion, although Hubbard also lost the gubernatorial election the next year to [[Ninian Edwards]] (the state Constitution also included a provision modelled on Virginia's which precluded governors from running for reelection).<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 141-143</ref> Finally, a lawsuit that political opponents in [[Madison County, Illinois]] brought against Coles for failing to pay a slave tax on his freed slaves years earlier took several more years, including shenanigans by pro-slavery judge [[Samuel McRoberts]], before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] ruled such payment unnecessary.<ref>citing Alvord, Governor Edward Coles (Illinois State Historical Society, 1920) at pp. 210-213.</ref> Coles' valedictory speech as governor in December 1826 reminded legislators of his previous speeches urging them to abolish slavery and its remnants (especially heritability) in the new state, as well as to finance a canal to the Great Lakes watershed and a penitentiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc25.html |title=Chapter 25 : The Result |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nAfter his term as governor expired, Coles returned briefly to Virginia, where his mother had died that spring. Coles then returned to his farm outside of Edwardsville. He focused on agricultural and business pursuits, between continued trips to Virginia and Philadelphia to visit family and friends and to search for a wife. His friend [[Daniel Pope Cook]] was defeated by a proslavery opponent in 1826, and legislators had selected their pro-slavery speaker [[John McLean (Illinois politician)|John McLean]] to fill unexpired U.S. Senate terms in 1824 and 1829 (voters ultimately electing [[Elias Kent Kane]] and [[John McCracken Robinson]] to those seats). Coles made his last run for public office in 1831. As candidate for Congress, running against eight candidates including pro-slavery Democrats Joseph Duncan (allied with Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]]) and Sidney Breese (a [[Jacksonian Democrat]]), Coles polled a distant third.<ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] p.271</ref> He had been out of public view for some years, and refused to align himself with any political party. Instead, Coles campaigned on his successful term as governor, proclaimed his association with the founding fathers, and criticized the Jacksonian platform. Still, Coles felt devastated by the political defeat, and moved back east.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 146-149</ref> Nonetheless, in 1835, Illinois legislators authorized Coles to sell bonds to finance his canal project, but since they also refused to back the bonds with state credit, sales proved slow.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc26.html |title=Chapter 26: The Rest of a Life |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Back to Virginia===\nWorried about his unmarried status and increasing partisanship, Coles decided to leave Illinois shortly after his election loss. He made another trip to Virginia, which was involved in its own debate over slavery after [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion. After Turner's execution, Coles wrote [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] urging emancipation and colonization to prevent further disasters, stressing that slavery restricted Virginia's economic development.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 152-153.</ref> At year's end, while visiting James and Dolley Madison at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], Madison confided in Coles his wish to manumit his own slaves and asked Coles about his experiences as he tried to find the right way to accomplish this while still  providing for Dolley as his widow. However, Madison died in 1836 without freeing any of his slaves which were left in a will to his wife Dolley.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp.161-162</ref><ref>Document:Edward Coles to James Madison, January 8, 1832, folder 30, box 1, E. Coles Papers, Princeton University Library.</ref>\n\n==Later life in Philadelphia==\nColes moved to Philadelphia in 1832, gratified by its active social and intellectual life, as well as slavery's absence. At age 46, Coles married prominent socialite Sally Logan Roberts (1809 to 1883) on November 28, 1833. The couple had three children: Mary Coles, Edward Coles, Jr., and Roberts Coles. Sally Coles inherited significant property upon her father's death, but it (and much of Coles' own fortune) was devastated by the [[Panic of 1837]]. Furthermore, his family's renovated Enniscorthy plantation burned down in 1839, and his elder brother Isaac only survived the disasters by two years.<ref name=\"virginia1\"/> Coles's last public appointment was in 1841, when he served on a committee investigating the U.S. Bank, which ultimately led to the resignation of his friend Nicholas Biddle.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\"/> Coles unsuccessfully sought political appointments from his Virginia classmates who had become high federal officials, [[John Tyler]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Still, rental income from real estate investments (widely spread geographically) kept the growing family financially comfortable. Coles and his young family travelled often to visit his extended family and properties in Virginia and Washington, D.C., as well as Illinois and later [[Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey]].\n\nHowever, Coles never resumed his political career, uncomfortable with the new party system. Nonetheless, he rejoiced when [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom he remembered as a young Illinois lawyer, was elected President. The elderly ex-governor briefly met the newly elected president on his journey to Washington.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 201-203</ref> Coles had also publicly taken exception to Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' characterization of slavery's history in Illinois during the [[Kansas-Nebraska]] debate of 1854.\n\nColes turned to history during his later years. He was recognized as one of the few remaining men with close personal knowledge of both Madison and Jefferson, and burnished their reputations as champions of the republican ideals that had also motivated Coles during his entire life.<ref>Document:Guasco, Suzanne Cooper. \"Managing Memory: The Cultivation of Elite Authority in Jacksonian America.\" paper presentation, annual conference, Society for Historians of the Early American Republic (SHEAR) Conference, Buffalo, NY July 20\u201323, 2000.</ref> Coles had lobbied both Jefferson and Madison (and later [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]) to free their slaves. Coles was surprised when Madison failed to do so, only later learning that lawyer [[Robert Taylor (congressman)|Robert Taylor]] had persuaded the former President to leave emancipation instructions for his widow, whose father had gone bankrupt after freeing his slaves many years earlier. Dolley, with other personal economic priorities (especially a son addicted to gambling), freed no slaves upon her death in 1849.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 160-166.</ref> Coles also wrote about the [[Northwest Ordinance]].

Coles also lived to see his elder son and namesake, Edward Coles, Jr., marry Elizabeth (Bessie) Mason Campbell, relative of anti-slavery founding father [[George Mason]] (descendant of his younger brother [[Thomson Mason]]) on February 25, 1868. Edward Coles Jr. became a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia, and a long-time vestry member of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]], which still displays a plaque honoring his service on the south wall inside the nave.\n\nThe Coles family grave at [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodlands Cemetery]] in west Philadelphia includes the final resting places of the former governor, his wife Sally, as well as their three children.

Those with a family history of alcoholism are more likely to develop it themselves (Enoch & Goldman, 2001); however, many individuals have developed alcoholism without a family history of the disease.  Since the consumption of alcohol is necessary to develop alcoholism, the availability of and attitudes towards alcohol in an individual's environment affect their likelihood of developing the disease.

However, this came decades after Rush and Trotter wrote their works, and some historians argue that the idea that habitual drinking was a diseased state emerged earlier.<ref>Along with Levine, see Roy Porter (\"Drinking Man's Disease: the 'Pre-History' of Alcoholism in Georgian Britain,\" ''British Journal of Addiction'' 80 (1985): 385-96) who places the idea to emerge with Trotter, Jessica Warner [\"'Resolved to Drink No More': Addiction as a preindustrial construct\" ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'' 55 (1994): 685-91] who uses a narrow reading of 17th century sermons to place it in the 1600s, Peter Ferentzy [\"From Sin to Disease: Differences and similarities between past and current conceptions on 'chronic drunkenness'\" ''Contemporary Drug Problems'' 28 (2001): 362-90] who successfully challenges Warner's argument by showing that the term \"disease\" was applied to many conditions that had little to do with physical debility, and James Nicholls [\"Vinum Britannicum: The 'Drink Question' in Early Modern England\" ''Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An interdisciplinary Journal'' 22 (2008): 6-25] who draws it together and argues that the idea emerged at different times in different places.</ref>\n\nGiven this controversy, the best one can say is that the idea that habitual alcohol drinking was a disease had become more acceptable by the middle of the nineteenth century, although many writers still argued it was a vice, a sin, and not the purview of medicine but of religion.<ref>See, for example, books with such telling titles as John Edwards Todd, ''Drunkenness, a Vice--not a Disease'' (1882).</ref>\n\nBetween 1980 and 1991, medical organizations, including the AMA, worked together to establish policies regarding their positions on the disease theory. These policies were developed in 1987 in part because third-party reimbursement for treatment was difficult or impossible unless alcoholism were categorized as a disease. The policies of the AMA, formed through consensus of the federation of state and specialty medical societies within their House of Delegates, state, in part: <blockquote>\"The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies, including alcoholism, are diseases and that their treatment is a legitimate part of medical practice.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1991, the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections.\n\n== Controlled drinking ==\nThe disease theory is often interpreted as implying that problem drinkers are incapable of returning to 'normal' problem free drinking, and therefore that treatment should focus on total abstinence. Some critics have used [http://findings.org.uk/count/downloads/download.php?file=cont_drink.hot evidence of controlled drinking] in formerly dependent drinkers to dispute the disease theory of alcoholism.\n\nThe first major empirical challenge to this interpretation of the disease theory followed a 1962 study by Dr. D.

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying \u0394FosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that \u0394FosB research will now progress into a new era \u2013 the use of \u0394FosB as a biomarker. If \u0394FosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...<br /><br />Conclusions<br />\u0394FosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cellular basis\">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin.

The report highlights the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms of action of different types of psychoactive substances, and explains how the use of these substances can lead to the development of dependence syndrome.\" The report states that \"dependence has not previously been recognized as a disorder of the brain, in the same way that psychiatric and mental illnesses were not previously viewed as being a result of a disorder of the brain. However, with recent advances in neuroscience, it is clear that dependence is as much a disorder of the brain as any other neurological or psychiatric illness.\"\n\nThe [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] and the [[American Medical Association]] both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism.

It funds approximately 90 percent of all such research in the United States. The official NIAAA position is that \"alcoholism is a disease. The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems. Like many other diseases, alcoholism is chronic, meaning that it lasts a person's lifetime; it usually follows a predictable course; and it has symptoms.

Those with a family history of alcoholism are more likely to develop it themselves (Enoch & Goldman, 2001); however, many individuals have developed alcoholism without a family history of the disease.  Since the consumption of alcohol is necessary to develop alcoholism, the availability of and attitudes towards alcohol in an individual's environment affect their likelihood of developing the disease.

These policies were developed in 1987 in part because third-party reimbursement for treatment was difficult or impossible unless alcoholism were categorized as a disease. The policies of the AMA, formed through consensus of the federation of state and specialty medical societies within their House of Delegates, state, in part: <blockquote>\"The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies, including alcoholism, are diseases and that their treatment is a legitimate part of medical practice.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1991, the AMA further endorsed the dual classification of alcoholism by the International Classification of Diseases under both psychiatric and medical sections.\n\n== Controlled drinking ==\nThe disease theory is often interpreted as implying that problem drinkers are incapable of returning to 'normal' problem free drinking, and therefore that treatment should focus on total abstinence.

The formation of \u0394FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for \u0394FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of \u0394FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of \u0394FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a \u2018\u2018molecular switch\u2019\u2019 (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of \u0394FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}</ref><ref name=\"Cellular basis\">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin.

The report highlights the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms of action of different types of psychoactive substances, and explains how the use of these substances can lead to the development of dependence syndrome.\" The report states that \"dependence has not previously been recognized as a disorder of the brain, in the same way that psychiatric and mental illnesses were not previously viewed as being a result of a disorder of the brain. However, with recent advances in neuroscience, it is clear that dependence is as much a disorder of the brain as any other neurological or psychiatric illness.\"\n\nThe [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] and the [[American Medical Association]] both maintain extensive policy regarding alcoholism.  The [[American Psychiatric Association]] recognizes the existence of \"alcoholism\" as the equivalent of alcohol dependence. The [[American Hospital Association]], the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], and the [[American College of Physicians]] classify \"alcoholism\" as a [[disease]].\n\nIn the US, the [[National Institutes of Health]] has a specific institute, the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA), concerned with the support and conduct of biomedical and behavioral research on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems. It funds approximately 90 percent of all such research in the United States. The official NIAAA position is that \"alcoholism is a disease. The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems. Like many other diseases, alcoholism is chronic, meaning that it lasts a person's lifetime; it usually follows a predictable course; and it has symptoms. The risk for developing alcoholism is influenced both by a person's genes and by his or her lifestyle.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/FAQs/General-English/default.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165736/http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/FAQs/General-English/default.htm|url-status=dead|title=FAQs for the General Public<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nCertain medications including opioid antagonists such as [[naltrexone]] have been shown to be effective in the treatment of alcoholism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R\u00f6sner|first=Susanne|last2=Hackl-Herrwerth|first2=Andrea|last3=Leucht|first3=Stefan|last4=Vecchi|first4=Simona|last5=Srisurapanont|first5=Manit|last6=Soyka|first6=Michael|date=2010-12-08|title=Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=12|pages=CD001867|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001867.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=21154349|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nSome physicians, scientists and others have rejected the disease theory of alcoholism on logical, empirical and other grounds.<ref>Heavy Drinking, Fingarette, Herbert, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1998 {{ISBN|0-520-06754-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robinroom.net|title=Robin Room|work=robinroom.net}}</ref><ref>Peele, S.

A disease cannot be cured by force of will; therefore, adding the medical label transfers the responsibility from the abuser to caregivers. Inevitably the abusers become unwilling victims, and just as inevitably they take on that role.  They argue that the disease theory of alcoholism exists only to benefit the professionals' and governmental agencies responsible for providing recovery services, and the disease model has not offered a solution for those attempting to stop abusive alcohol and drug use.<ref name=\"baldwinresearch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baldwinresearch.com/alcoholism.cfm |title=Alcoholism: A disease of speculation |publisher=Baldwinresearch.com |date=2002-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>\n\nThese critics hold that by removing some of the stigma and personal responsibility the disease concept actually increases alcoholism and drug abuse and thus the need for treatment.<ref name=\"baldwinresearch\" />  This is somewhat supported by a study which found that a greater belief in the disease theory of alcoholism and higher commitment to total abstinence to be factors correlated with increased likelihood that an alcoholic would have a full-blown relapse (substantial continued use) following an initial lapse (single use).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller WR, Westerberg VS, Harris RJ, Tonigan JS  | title = What predicts relapse?

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994\u20131995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare]] and raids on the flatlands in spite of Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]]. The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]]. During the war Russian forces largely recaptured the separatist region of [[Chechnya]].<ref>GlobalSecurity.org, [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm Second Chechnya War \u2013 1999\u2013???]</ref> The campaign largely reversed the outcome of the [[First Chechen War]], in which the region gained de facto [[independence]] as the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].\n*The [[Kargil War]] (1999) \u2013 In May 1999, Pakistan sent troops covertly to occupy strategic peaks in [[Kashmir]]. A month later the [[Kargil War]] with India results in a political fiasco for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident leads to a military [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in October, in which Sharif is ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].

The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992\u20131995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since World War II at that time as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombard and attack [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occur including [[ethnic cleansing]] and destruction of civilian property.\n**The final fighting in Croatian and Bosnian wars ends in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces and the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia in 1995; Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces; and finally the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat federation]].\n*[[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999) \u2013 the war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]] begins in 1996 and escalates in 1998 with increasing reports of atrocities taking place.\n**In 1999, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) led by the United States launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]] due to accusations of war crimes being committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups.

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments.

These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/kyoto-protocol-to-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change/963B9A4FEEB7342563BFE2A5B17AD188|title=The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|last1=Breidenich|first1=Clare|last2=Magraw|first2=Daniel|last3=Rowley|first3=Anne|last4=Rubin|first4=James W.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=April 1998|accessdate=April 9, 2020|volume=92|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2998044}}</ref>\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent.

Popular American contemporary R&B artists included [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[En Vogue]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[Vanessa L. Williams]].\n\nThe [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] brought 120,000 people together in the interest of increased human rights and autonomy for [[Tibet]] from China. [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s. The 1990s also became the most important decade for [[ska punk]]/[[reggae fusion|reggae rock]], with the success of many bands like [[Buck-O-Nine]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[No Doubt]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Save Ferris]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Sugar Ray]].\n\nThe [[rave]] movement that emerged in the late 1980s rose. Rave spawned genres such as [[Intelligent dance music]] and [[Drum and bass]]. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]].

''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down.

The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power.

The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]].

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere.

Popular American contemporary R&B artists included [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[En Vogue]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[Vanessa L.

[[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s. The 1990s also became the most important decade for [[ska punk]]/[[reggae fusion|reggae rock]], with the success of many bands like [[Buck-O-Nine]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[No Doubt]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Save Ferris]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Sugar Ray]].\n\nThe [[rave]] movement that emerged in the late 1980s rose. Rave spawned genres such as [[Intelligent dance music]] and [[Drum and bass]]. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]. Popular artists included [[Moby]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[the Orb]], [[the Chemical Brothers]], [[Basement Jaxx]], [[Todd Terry]], [[808 State]], [[Primal Scream]], [[the Shamen]], [[the KLF]] and [[the Prodigy]].\n\nThe rise of [[industrial music]], somewhat a fusion of [[synthpop]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], rose to worldwide popularity with bands like [[Godflesh]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Rammstein]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. [[Groove metal]] was born through the efforts of [[Pantera]], whose seventh studio album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'' (1994) was notable for going number one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Another heavy metal subgenre called nu metal, which mixed metal with hip hop influences, becomes popular with bands like [[Korn]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] selling millions of albums worldwide. [[Metallica]]'s 1991 eponymous album ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' is the best-selling album of the [[Soundscan|SoundScan]] era, while [[extreme metal]] acts such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Cannibal Corpse]] and others experienced popularity throughout the decade.\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Shania Twain]] and [[Garth Brooks]].<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en|title=Country is No. 1 musical style|date=19 August 1992|newspaper=Reading Eagle|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en|title=Country music reflects the time|date=27 September 1992|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google|title=Country music is making waves across the seas|date=25 November 1993|work=The Star|accessdate=26 July 2010|first=Jack|last=Hurst}}</ref> The latter enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

Lasting for 9 seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects, and was one of the few shows ever to perform karate.\n\n1993 also saw its debut of the [[medical]]\u2013[[:wikt:mystery|mystery]] drama, ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Dick Van Dyke]], who guest-starred on an episode of its sequel, ''[[Jake and The Fatman]]'', where the show got off to a rocky start, and became one of television's long-running mysteries, that lasted until its cancelation in 2001.\n\nMedical dramas started to come into television in the '90s. One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000. It established the teen soap genre paving the way for ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', and other shows airing in later years. The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down. After the successful debuts of ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Don Johnson]], lasting 6 seasons (1996\u20132001) which also dealt with escapist entertainment, rather than tackling issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-25/entertainment/ca-62314_1_miami-vice|title=With a New Beat and Attitude, the 'Vice' Man Cometh|first=HEATHER|last=McCABE|date=25 April 1996|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nReality television began on MTV; this would grow in importance in the western world into the next decade.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, two of the biggest professional wrestling companies: ''[[World Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[World Wrestling Federation]]'' were in a ratings battle that was dubbed the Monday Night Wars (1995\u20132001). Each company fought to draw more viewers to their respective Monday night wrestling show. The \"War\" ended in 2001 when ''[[WWE]]'' bought ''[[WCW]]''. In November 2001, there was a Winner Takes All match with both companies in a Pay-Per-View called ''[[Survivor Series]]''. WWF won the match; putting a final end to WCW.\n\nAs an animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', debuted in December 1989, became a domestic and international success in the 1990s. The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

One of Nickelodeon's most popular and longest running series, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', started in 1999 and became a huge success.\n\nAmerican animated children's programs went through a renaissance during the decade with studios producing many critically acclaimed shows. Specifically ''[[Warner Bros Animation]]'' shows like''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Also syndicated shows like ''[[Phantom 2040]]''.\n\nThe late 90s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', hosted by [[Regis Philbin]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as other first-run game shows aired in primetime on the newly launched [[Game Show Network]].\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1990s in fashion}}\n[[File:Jonathan Brandis Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Grunge]]-style flannel shirt and [[curtained hair]]]]\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1990s include:\n*[[Rachel haircut|The Rachel]], [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s hairstyle on the hit show ''[[Friends]]'', became a cultural phenomenon with millions of women copying it worldwide.\n*The [[Curtained hair|Curtained Haircut]] increased in popularity in fashion and culture among teenage boys and young men in the 1990s, mainly after it was popularized in the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' by the actor [[Edward Furlong]].\n*The model 1300 [[Wonderbra]] style has a resurgence of popularity in Europe in 1992 which kicks off a multinational media sensation, the 1994 re-introduction of \"The Wonderbra\" brand, and a spike in push-up, plunge bras around the world.\n*Additional fashion trends of the 1990s include the [[Tamagotchi]], [[Inline skates|Rollerblades]], [[Pogs]] and [[Dr. Martens]] shoes.\n*Bleached Blond hair became very popular in the late '90s, as was men with short hair with the bangs \"flipped up\".\n*The 1990s also saw the return of '70s teen female fashion with long, straight hair and denim hot pants.\n*''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'' sideburns also became popular in the early and mid-1990s.\n*[[Slap bracelet]]s were a popular fad among children, pre-teens and teenagers in the early 1990s and were available in a wide variety of patterns and colors.

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999.
