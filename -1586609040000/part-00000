{"title_page": "Psychology of self", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience}}\n{{distinguish|Self psychology}}\nThe '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[Conative function|conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology derived from the distinction between the self as ''I,'' the subjective knower, and the self as ''Me'', the object that is known.<ref>James, W. (1891).  ''The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1891)</ref>\n\nCurrent views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].<ref>Sedikides, C. & Spencer, S. J. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Self''. New York: Psychology Press</ref> It may be the case that we can now usefully attempt to ground experience of self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of modern identity are composed.\n\nThe self has many facets that help make up integral parts of it, such as [[self-awareness]], [[self-esteem]], [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and [[self-perception]]. All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society.\n\nA useful accounting of contributing factors to what we call \"selfhood\" is the self gradually emerges and arises at the intersection between:\n*the habits in our biological-metabolic processes,\n*the socio-cultural habits of local culture inculcated into us,\n*our role models, good and bad,\n*how much responsibility the individual takes to make healthy choices gain and again, develop and strengthen their own Chooser self.\n\n==Kohut's formulation==\n{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}\nHeinz Kohut<ref>H. Kohut (1966), \"Forms and Transformations of Narcissism\" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97\u2013123</ref> initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''<ref>H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press</ref>), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.\n\nKohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic [[transference]] (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.\n\nKohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.\n\nKohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.\n\nAccording to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',<ref>A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978<ref>\"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment\", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425</ref> explain:\n\n''\"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)\"''\n\nKohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient\u2014to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).\n\n==Winnicott's selves==\n{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}\nDonald Winnicott distinguished what he called the \"true self\" from the \"false self\" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230</ref> As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about \"being active\", but not about \"just growing, just breathing\"':<ref>Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82</ref> it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.\n\nNevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization \u2013 a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318</ref>\nFive levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\">Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148</ref> \n# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.<ref>Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149</ref>  \n# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.\n# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.\n# Even closer to health, we find the false self \"... established on the basis of identifications\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 121</ref>\n# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\"/>\n\nAs for the true self, Winnicott linked it both to playing, and to a kind of  \"hide and seek\"' designed to protect creative ownership of one's real self against exploitation,<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 121</ref> without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 187</ref>\n\n==Berne's transactional analysis==\n<!--This section is linked from [[Inner critic]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])-->\n{{Main|Eric Berne|Transactional analysis}}\nIn his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality's [[Transactional Analysis#The Ego-State (or Parent-Adult-Child, PAC) model|ego states]] - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called 'the real Self, the one that can move from one ego state to another'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 276</ref>\n* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.\n* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.\n* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The less people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf|title=Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. \"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics.\" Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22.}}</ref>\nBerne considered that 'the feeling of \"Self\" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.<ref>Berne, p. 248-9</ref>\n\nA person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/>\n\nTransactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/> Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'<ref>Berne, p. 276</ref>\n\n== Jungian archetype of the self ==\n{{Main|Self (Jung)}}\nIn classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\">Fadiman, J. [http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php Transpersonal Pioneers: Carl Jung.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425105134/http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=2013-04-25 }} Personality and Personal Growth. By R. Frager. Excerpt from ''Personality and Personal Growth'' 6th ed. New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 56. Sofia University.</ref> The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the consciousness and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\">Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208</ref>\n\nWhat distinguishes classical Jungian psychology from earlier theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality\u2014including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: \"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc.\"<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/>\n\nThe Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being. Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy| author=Thompson, E | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2017 | url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/waking-dreaming-being/9780231137096}}</ref>\n\n==Critiques of the concept==\n'Selfhood' or complete autonomy is a common Western approach to psychology and models of self are employed constantly in areas such as [[psychotherapy]] and [[self-help]]. [[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.\n\nThe very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',<ref>Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78</ref> thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].\n\n<!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[\u2018the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. -->\nIt is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.\n\nAs for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31</ref> is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to \"make my living\" by keeping his mother alive'.<ref>Minsky, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.<ref name=Self>Tapu, CS (2001). ''[http://relationtherapy.webs.com/Hypostatic_Personality/Hypostatic_Personality.htm Hypostatic Personality: Psychopathology of Doing and Being Made]''. Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.</ref> The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.\n\"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.\"<ref name=Self />\n\n==Memory and the self==\n\nMemory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf|title=Conway, Martin A. \"Memory and the Self.\" Journal of Memory and Language 53 (2005): 594-628.

The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.<ref name=\"The Self\">Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. \"The Self.\" Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57\u201396. Print.</ref>\n\n===Self-knowledge===\n{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}\nSelf-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSelf-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.<ref name= \"McLeod\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref> People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.<ref name=\"McLeod\"/> In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> People with low self-esteem typically:\n\n:*do not wish to fail\n:*are less confident in their success rate\n:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)\n:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]\n:*are more prone to emotional imbalances<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people\n:*worry what others think about them consistently\n:*have more pessimistic thinking\n:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people<ref name=\"McLeod\"/>\n\n:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:*overestimating their own good qualities\n:*their control over happenings in their life\n:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n===Interpersonal self===\nInterpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSocial roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the \"expected\" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref>\n\nSocial norms constitute the \"unwritten rules\" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\"/>\n\n===Agent self===\nThe agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n{{Main|Outline of self}}\n*[[Identity (social science)]]\n*[['I' and the 'me']]\n*[[Personality psychology|Personality]]\n*[[Self-concept]]\n*[[Self-discovery]]\n*[[Self-schema]]\n*[[Self (philosophy)]]\n*[[Self psychology]]\n*[[Self (sociology)]]\n*[[Ego (spirituality)]]\n*[[Ho'oponopono]]\n*[[Dialogical self]]\n*[[Reflexive self-consciousness]]\n*[[Future self]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wilderdom.com/self Definitions of Various Self Constructs] - Self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence & self-concept.\n*[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/self.htm Discussion of Self] \u2013 Page of the Emotional Competency website.\n*[http://iautistic.com/autism-theory-of-mind-revisited.php Theory of Self] - Proposed by an autistic to explain autism\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=OE0yeuILAlMC&pg=PA1 Images of the Self]\n*[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/false-self False self]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self (Psychology)}}\n[[Category:Self|*]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of self|Psychological]]\n[[Category:Ego psychology]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n\n[[cs:Bytostn\u00e9 j\u00e1]]\n[[da:Selvet (psykologi)]]\n[[fr:Soi (psychologie)]]\n[[ja:\u81ea\u5df1]]\n[[sk:Selbst]]\n[[sr:\u0408\u0430]]\n[[sv:Sj\u00e4lvet]]\n[[yi:\u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc]]\n[[zh:\u81ea\u6027]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience}}\n{{distinguish|Self psychology}}\nThe '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[Conative function|conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology derived from the distinction between the self as ''I,'' the subjective knower, and the self as ''Me'', the object that is known.<ref>James, W. (1891).  ''The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.

New York: Psychology Press</ref> It may be the case that we can now usefully attempt to ground experience of self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of modern identity are composed.\n\nThe self has many facets that help make up integral parts of it, such as [[self-awareness]], [[self-esteem]], [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and [[self-perception]]. All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society. \n\nA useful accounting of contributing factors to what we call \"selfhood\" is the self gradually emerges and arises at the intersection between:\n*the habits in our biological-metabolic processes,\n*the socio-cultural habits of local culture inculcated into us,\n*our role models, good and bad,\n*how much responsibility the individual takes to make healthy choices gain and again, develop and strengthen their own Chooser self.\n\n==Kohut's formulation==\n{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}\nHeinz Kohut<ref>H. Kohut (1966), \"Forms and Transformations of Narcissism\" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97\u2013123</ref> initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''<ref>H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press</ref>), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.\n\nKohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic [[transference]] (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.\n\nKohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.\n\nKohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.\n\nAccording to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',<ref>A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978<ref>\"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment\", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425</ref> explain:\n\n''\"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)\"''\n\nKohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient\u2014to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).\n\n==Winnicott's selves==\n{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}\nDonald Winnicott distinguished what he called the \"true self\" from the \"false self\" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230</ref> As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about \"being active\", but not about \"just growing, just breathing\"':<ref>Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82</ref> it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.\n\nNevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization \u2013 a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318</ref>\nFive levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\">Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148</ref> \n# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.<ref>Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149</ref>  \n# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.\n# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.\n# Even closer to health, we find the false self \"... established on the basis of identifications\".<ref>D. W.

(1974) p. 276</ref>\n* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.\n* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.\n* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The less people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf|title=Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. \"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics.\" Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22.}}</ref>\nBerne considered that 'the feeling of \"Self\" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.<ref>Berne, p. 248-9</ref>\n\nA person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/>\n\nTransactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/> Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'<ref>Berne, p. 276</ref>\n\n== Jungian archetype of the self ==\n{{Main|Self (Jung)}}\nIn classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\">Fadiman, J. [http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php Transpersonal Pioneers: Carl Jung.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425105134/http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=2013-04-25 }} Personality and Personal Growth. By R. Frager. Excerpt from ''Personality and Personal Growth'' 6th ed. New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 56. Sofia University.</ref> The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the consciousness and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\">Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208</ref>\n\nWhat distinguishes classical Jungian psychology from earlier theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality\u2014including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: \"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc.\"<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/>\n\nThe Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being.

[[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.\n\nThe very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',<ref>Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78</ref> thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].\n\n<!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[\u2018the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. -->\nIt is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.\n\nAs for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31</ref> is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to \"make my living\" by keeping his mother alive'.<ref>Minsky, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.<ref name=Self>Tapu, CS (2001).

Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.</ref> The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.\n\"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.\"<ref name=Self />\n\n==Memory and the self==\n\nMemory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf|title=Conway, Martin A. \"Memory and the Self.\" Journal of Memory and Language 53 (2005): 594-628.

One example of this is a study by Conway and Ross,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Michael|last2=Ross|first2=Michael|title=Getting what you want by revising what you had.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738|year=1984}}</ref> which demonstrates that if a change in skill is expected, but there is no actual improvement, people will believe that their past skill state was worse than it was.\n\n=== Recalling Pain ===\nIn general recollection of pain is fairly accurate, although differences are seen between recollection of acute and chronic pain. Research suggests that recall for acute pain is more accurate than recall for chronic pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Myra|last2=Philips|first2=Clare|last3=Rachman|first3=Stanley|title=Memory for pain|journal=Pain|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35\u201346|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6|pmid=424233|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting phenomenon seen in recollection of pain in the self is the peak-end phenomenon. Research has shown that when enduring painful experiences, people will 'prefer' more drawn out experiences that end with lower levels of pain, over shorter experiences that end with higher levels of pain, even though the shorter experiences provide less pain overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A|last2=Katz|first2=Joel|last3=Kahneman|first3=Daniel|title=Memories of colonoscopy: a randomized trial|journal=Pain|volume=104|issue=1|pages=187\u2013194|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(03)00003-4|year=2003|hdl=10315/7959}}</ref>\n\nRecalled ratings of pain are more closely related to a combination of the peak pain in the experience, and the end pain of the experience.

The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.<ref name=\"The Self\">Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. \"The Self.\" Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57\u201396. Print.</ref>\n\n===Self-knowledge===\n{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}\nSelf-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSelf-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.<ref name= \"McLeod\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref> People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.<ref name=\"McLeod\"/> In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> People with low self-esteem typically:\n\n:*do not wish to fail\n:*are less confident in their success rate\n:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)\n:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]\n:*are more prone to emotional imbalances<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people\n:*worry what others think about them consistently\n:*have more pessimistic thinking\n:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people<ref name=\"McLeod\"/>\n\n:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:*overestimating their own good qualities\n:*their control over happenings in their life\n:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n===Interpersonal self===\nInterpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSocial roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the \"expected\" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref>\n\nSocial norms constitute the \"unwritten rules\" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\"/>\n\n===Agent self===\nThe agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n{{Main|Outline of self}}\n*[[Identity (social science)]]\n*[['I' and the 'me']]\n*[[Personality psychology|Personality]]\n*[[Self-concept]]\n*[[Self-discovery]]\n*[[Self-schema]]\n*[[Self (philosophy)]]\n*[[Self psychology]]\n*[[Self (sociology)]]\n*[[Ego (spirituality)]]\n*[[Ho'oponopono]]\n*[[Dialogical self]]\n*[[Reflexive self-consciousness]]\n*[[Future self]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wilderdom.com/self Definitions of Various Self Constructs] - Self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence & self-concept.\n*[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/self.htm Discussion of Self] \u2013 Page of the Emotional Competency website.\n*[http://iautistic.com/autism-theory-of-mind-revisited.php Theory of Self] - Proposed by an autistic to explain autism\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=OE0yeuILAlMC&pg=PA1 Images of the Self]\n*[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/false-self False self]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self (Psychology)}}\n[[Category:Self|*]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of self|Psychological]]\n[[Category:Ego psychology]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n\n[[cs:Bytostn\u00e9 j\u00e1]]\n[[da:Selvet (psykologi)]]\n[[fr:Soi (psychologie)]]\n[[ja:\u81ea\u5df1]]\n[[sk:Selbst]]\n[[sr:\u0408\u0430]]\n[[sv:Sj\u00e4lvet]]\n[[yi:\u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc]]\n[[zh:\u81ea\u6027]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 2 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_self"}

The family exhibits considerable [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and includes the '''crakes''', '''coots''', and '''gallinules'''. Many [[species]] are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, [[Polar climate|polar]] regions, and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas above the [[snow line]]. Members of the Rallidae occur on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Numerous island species are known. The most common rail habitats are [[marsh]]land and dense forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation.<ref name=h&r2003-206-7>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\n\"Rail\" is derived from French ''r\u00e2le'', from Old French ''rasle''.  It is named from its harsh cry, in [[Vulgar Latin]] *''rascula'', from [[Latin]] ''r\u0101dere'' ('to scrape').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-q6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&dq=rasculum+rail#v=onepage|title=Lapwings, Loons and Lousy Jacks: The How and Why of Bird Names|first=Ray|last=Reedman|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Pelagic Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784270933|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Takahe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|South Island [[takahe]] (''Porphyrio hochstetteri'') from behind, showing the short, soft, and fluffy [[Flight feather|remiges]] typical of flightless rails]]\nThe rails are a family of small to medium-sized, ground-living birds. They vary in length from {{convert|12|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} and in weight from {{convert|20|to|3000|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.\n\nThe [[beak|bill]] is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the [[clapper rail]] of [[the Americas]]); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the [[coot]]s), or massive (as in the [[Porphyrio|purple gallinules]]).<ref name=h&r2003-208>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 208</ref> A few coots and gallinules have a [[frontal shield]], which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the [[horned coot]].<ref name=h&r2003-210>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 210</ref>\n\nRails exhibit very little [[sexual dimorphism]] in either [[plumage]] or size.\n\n===Flight and flightlessness===\nThe wings of all rails are short and rounded. The [[bird flight|flight]] of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species [[bird migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]], a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] periods.<ref name=h&r2003-209>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 209</ref>\n\nFlightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of [[parallel evolution]] in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors.<ref>Kirchman (2012)</ref> This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.\n\nMany island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight in flying Rallidae species. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, reduces the flightless rail's energy expenditures.<ref>McNab & Ellis (2006)</ref> For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\">McNab (1994)</ref> This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to find niches.<ref>Trewick (1997)</ref>\n\nIn addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively shortened wings to begin with, which in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, lends speed to the evolution of flightlessness, making it remarkably fast;<ref>Livezey 2003</ref> as few as 125,000 years were needed for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly.<ref>Slikas ''et al.'' (2002)</ref> Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\">McNab 2002</ref>\n[[File:American Coot skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[American coot]] (Fulica americana) skeleton on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]].]]\nIt is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands.<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\">McNab and Ellis 2006</ref> Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, ''[[buff-banded rail|Gallirallus philippensis]]'', ''[[purple swamphen|Porphyrio porphyrio]]'', and ''[[spotless crake|Porzana tabuensis]]'', exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands,<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\"/> though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\">Kirchman 2012</ref> In examining the phylogeny of ''G. philippensis'', although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\"/>\n\nA consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their \"tolerance\" and \"approachability\".<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican [[blue tit]]s exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts,<ref>Perret and Blondel 1993</ref> but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives.<ref>Granjon and Cheylan 1989</ref> The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIn general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat [[invertebrate]]s, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]].<ref name=h&r2003-206-7 /> The [[bird song|calls]] of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike.<ref name=\"Perrins p207\">Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p.&nbsp;207</ref> Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]].<ref name=h&r2003-208 />\n\nThe most typical family members occupy dense [[vegetation]] in damp environments near [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, or [[river]]s. [[Reed bed]]s are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that [[bird migration|migrate]] do so at night.\n\nMost [[bird nest|nest]] in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak [[Bird flight|fliers]], they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become [[Flightless bird|flightless]], and many of them are now [[Extinction|extinct]] following the introduction of terrestrial [[Predation|predators]] such as [[cat]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[pig]]s.\n\nMany reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), [[crepuscular]], and have laterally flattened bodies. In the [[Old World]], long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. [[North America]]n species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is [[Swinhoe's rail]], at {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} and 25&nbsp;g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names. The black coots are more adapted to open water than their relatives, and some other large species are called gallinules and swamphens. The largest of this group is the [[takahe]], at {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rails have suffered disproportionally from human changes to the environment, and an estimated<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Magnitude and variation of prehistoric bird extinctions in the Pacific|first1=Richard P.|last1=Duncan|first2=Alison G.|last2=Boyer|first3=Tim M.|last3=Blackburn|year=2013|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=16|pages=6436\u20136441|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216511110|pmid=23530197|pmc=3631643}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therevelator.org/memorial-day-wake-island-rail/|title=Memorializing the Wake Island Rail: An Extinction Caused by War|last=Platt|first=John R.|date=May 2018|website=TheRevelator.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Extinction and Biogeography of Tropical Pacific Birds|last=Steadman|first=David W.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=9780226771427|location=|pages=296}}</ref> several hundred species of island rails have become extinct because of this. Several island species of rails remain [[endangered species|endangered]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]] organisations and governments continue to work to prevent their extinction.\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding behaviors of many Rallidae species are poorly understood or unknown. Most are thought to be [[Monogamy|monogamous]], although [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry]] have been reported.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210</ref> Most often, they lay five to 10 [[egg (biology)|eggs]].

They often depend on their parents until fledging, which happens around 1 month old.<ref name=h&r2003-210 />\n\n==Rallidae and humans==\n[[File:GuamRail02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Guam rail]] is an example of an island species that has been badly affected by [[introduced species]].]]\n\nSome larger, more abundant rails are [[hunting|hunted]] and their eggs collected for food.<ref name=h&r2003-211>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 211</ref> The [[Wake Island rail]] was hunted to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison after the island was cut off from supply during [[World War II]].<ref>BLI (2007)</ref> At least two species, the [[common moorhen]] and the [[American purple gallinule]], have been considered [[Pest (organism)|pests]].<ref name=h&r2003-211 />\n\n===Threats and conservation===\nDue to their tendencies towards flightlessness, many island species have been unable to cope with introduced species. The most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] as people colonised the islands of [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]], and [[Micronesia]], during which an estimated 750\u20131800 species of birds became extinct, half of which were rails.<ref>Steadman (2006)</ref> Some species that came close to extinction, such as the [[Lord Howe woodhen]], and the takahe, have made modest recoveries due to the efforts of conservation organisations. The [[Guam rail]] came perilously close to extinction when [[brown tree snake]]s were introduced to [[Guam]], but some of the last remaining individuals were taken into captivity and are breeding well, though attempts at reintroduction have met with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/GUAM-BROWN-TREE-SNAKE-RESPONSIBLE-FOR-EXTINCTION-OF-5-SPECIES/4b735e75e7fe9b8d2ef464b66ecaaa0c?searchfilter=Compilations%2Furl%2FAnimal+Attacks%2F46|title=GUAM: BROWN TREE SNAKE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTINCTION OF 5 SPECIES|last=|first=|date=February 1996|website=AP Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/guam-rail|title=Guam Rail Gallirallus owstoni|last=|first=|date=|website=San Diego Zoo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/guam-bird-coming-back-extinction-wild|title=Is this Guam bird coming back from extinction in the wild?|last=Hurrell|first=Shaun|date=|website=BirdLife International.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\nThe family Rallidae was introduced (as Rallia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=70 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310148 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=136, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref>\nThe family has traditionally been grouped with two families of larger birds, the [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[bustard]]s, as well as several smaller families of usually \"primitive\" midsized amphibious birds, to make up the order [[Gruiformes]].

The family exhibits considerable [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and includes the '''crakes''', '''coots''', and '''gallinules'''. Many [[species]] are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, [[Polar climate|polar]] regions, and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas above the [[snow line]]. Members of the Rallidae occur on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Numerous island species are known. The most common rail habitats are [[marsh]]land and dense forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation.<ref name=h&r2003-206-7>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\n\"Rail\" is derived from French ''r\u00e2le'', from Old French ''rasle''.  It is named from its harsh cry, in [[Vulgar Latin]] *''rascula'', from [[Latin]] ''r\u0101dere'' ('to scrape').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-q6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&dq=rasculum+rail#v=onepage|title=Lapwings, Loons and Lousy Jacks: The How and Why of Bird Names|first=Ray|last=Reedman|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Pelagic Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784270933|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Takahe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|South Island [[takahe]] (''Porphyrio hochstetteri'') from behind, showing the short, soft, and fluffy [[Flight feather|remiges]] typical of flightless rails]]\nThe rails are a family of small to medium-sized, ground-living birds. They vary in length from {{convert|12|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} and in weight from {{convert|20|to|3000|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.\n\nThe [[beak|bill]] is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the [[clapper rail]] of [[the Americas]]); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the [[coot]]s), or massive (as in the [[Porphyrio|purple gallinules]]).<ref name=h&r2003-208>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 208</ref> A few coots and gallinules have a [[frontal shield]], which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the [[horned coot]].<ref name=h&r2003-210>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 210</ref>\n\nRails exhibit very little [[sexual dimorphism]] in either [[plumage]] or size.\n\n===Flight and flightlessness===\nThe wings of all rails are short and rounded. The [[bird flight|flight]] of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species [[bird migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]], a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] periods.<ref name=h&r2003-209>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 209</ref>\n\nFlightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of [[parallel evolution]] in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors.<ref>Kirchman (2012)</ref> This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.\n\nMany island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight in flying Rallidae species. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, reduces the flightless rail's energy expenditures.<ref>McNab & Ellis (2006)</ref> For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\">McNab (1994)</ref> This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to find niches.<ref>Trewick (1997)</ref>\n\nIn addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively shortened wings to begin with, which in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, lends speed to the evolution of flightlessness, making it remarkably fast;<ref>Livezey 2003</ref> as few as 125,000 years were needed for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly.<ref>Slikas ''et al.'' (2002)</ref> Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\">McNab 2002</ref>\n[[File:American Coot skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[American coot]] (Fulica americana) skeleton on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]].]]\nIt is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands.<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\">McNab and Ellis 2006</ref> Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, ''[[buff-banded rail|Gallirallus philippensis]]'', ''[[purple swamphen|Porphyrio porphyrio]]'', and ''[[spotless crake|Porzana tabuensis]]'', exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands,<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\"/> though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\">Kirchman 2012</ref> In examining the phylogeny of ''G. philippensis'', although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\"/>\n\nA consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their \"tolerance\" and \"approachability\".<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican [[blue tit]]s exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts,<ref>Perret and Blondel 1993</ref> but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives.<ref>Granjon and Cheylan 1989</ref> The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIn general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat [[invertebrate]]s, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]].<ref name=h&r2003-206-7 /> The [[bird song|calls]] of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike.<ref name=\"Perrins p207\">Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p.&nbsp;207</ref> Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]].<ref name=h&r2003-208 />\n\nThe most typical family members occupy dense [[vegetation]] in damp environments near [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, or [[river]]s. [[Reed bed]]s are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that [[bird migration|migrate]] do so at night.\n\nMost [[bird nest|nest]] in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak [[Bird flight|fliers]], they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become [[Flightless bird|flightless]], and many of them are now [[Extinction|extinct]] following the introduction of terrestrial [[Predation|predators]] such as [[cat]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[pig]]s.\n\nMany reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), [[crepuscular]], and have laterally flattened bodies. In the [[Old World]], long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. [[North America]]n species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is [[Swinhoe's rail]], at {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} and 25&nbsp;g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names. The black coots are more adapted to open water than their relatives, and some other large species are called gallinules and swamphens. The largest of this group is the [[takahe]], at {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rails have suffered disproportionally from human changes to the environment, and an estimated<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Magnitude and variation of prehistoric bird extinctions in the Pacific|first1=Richard P.|last1=Duncan|first2=Alison G.|last2=Boyer|first3=Tim M.|last3=Blackburn|year=2013|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=16|pages=6436\u20136441|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216511110|pmid=23530197|pmc=3631643}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therevelator.org/memorial-day-wake-island-rail/|title=Memorializing the Wake Island Rail: An Extinction Caused by War|last=Platt|first=John R.|date=May 2018|website=TheRevelator.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Extinction and Biogeography of Tropical Pacific Birds|last=Steadman|first=David W.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=9780226771427|location=|pages=296}}</ref> several hundred species of island rails have become extinct because of this. Several island species of rails remain [[endangered species|endangered]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]] organisations and governments continue to work to prevent their extinction.\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding behaviors of many Rallidae species are poorly understood or unknown. Most are thought to be [[Monogamy|monogamous]], although [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry]] have been reported.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210</ref> Most often, they lay five to 10 [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. [[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch]]es as small as one or as large as 15 eggs are known.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10 /> Egg clutches may not always hatch at the same time. Chicks become mobile after a few days. They often depend on their parents until fledging, which happens around 1 month old.<ref name=h&r2003-210 />\n\n==Rallidae and humans==\n[[File:GuamRail02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Guam rail]] is an example of an island species that has been badly affected by [[introduced species]].]]\n\nSome larger, more abundant rails are [[hunting|hunted]] and their eggs collected for food.<ref name=h&r2003-211>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 211</ref> The [[Wake Island rail]] was hunted to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison after the island was cut off from supply during [[World War II]].<ref>BLI (2007)</ref> At least two species, the [[common moorhen]] and the [[American purple gallinule]], have been considered [[Pest (organism)|pests]].<ref name=h&r2003-211 />\n\n===Threats and conservation===\nDue to their tendencies towards flightlessness, many island species have been unable to cope with introduced species. The most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] as people colonised the islands of [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]], and [[Micronesia]], during which an estimated 750\u20131800 species of birds became extinct, half of which were rails.<ref>Steadman (2006)</ref> Some species that came close to extinction, such as the [[Lord Howe woodhen]], and the takahe, have made modest recoveries due to the efforts of conservation organisations. The [[Guam rail]] came perilously close to extinction when [[brown tree snake]]s were introduced to [[Guam]], but some of the last remaining individuals were taken into captivity and are breeding well, though attempts at reintroduction have met with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/GUAM-BROWN-TREE-SNAKE-RESPONSIBLE-FOR-EXTINCTION-OF-5-SPECIES/4b735e75e7fe9b8d2ef464b66ecaaa0c?searchfilter=Compilations%2Furl%2FAnimal+Attacks%2F46|title=GUAM: BROWN TREE SNAKE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTINCTION OF 5 SPECIES|last=|first=|date=February 1996|website=AP Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/guam-rail|title=Guam Rail Gallirallus owstoni|last=|first=|date=|website=San Diego Zoo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/guam-bird-coming-back-extinction-wild|title=Is this Guam bird coming back from extinction in the wild?|last=Hurrell|first=Shaun|date=|website=BirdLife International.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\nThe family Rallidae was introduced (as Rallia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=70 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310148 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=136, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref>\nThe family has traditionally been grouped with two families of larger birds, the [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[bustard]]s, as well as several smaller families of usually \"primitive\" midsized amphibious birds, to make up the order [[Gruiformes]].

However, such a group would probably also include the [[Heliornithidae]] (finfoots and sungrebes), an exclusively [[Tropics|tropical]] group that is somewhat [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with [[grebe]]s, and usually united with the rails in the Ralli.\n\n===Extant and recently extinct genera===\n[[File:Red-Legged Crake.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red-legged crake]], ''Rallina fasciata'']]\n[[File:Rallus aquaticus 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|right|[[Water rail]], ''Rallus aquaticus'']]\n[[File:Porzana porzana 5 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|right|Immature [[spotted crake]] (''Porzana porzana'')]]\nThe list maintained by [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]] and David Donsker on behalf of the [[International Ornithological Committee]] (IOC) contains 156 species divided into 41 genera.<ref name=ioc>{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor1-link=Frank Gill (ornithologist) | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | year=2019 | title=Flufftails, finfoots, rails, trumpeters, cranes, limpkin | work=World Bird List Version 9.2 | url=https://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/flufftails/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union | accessdate=8 July 2019 }}</ref> For more detail, see [[List of rail species]].\n\n* ''Himantornis'' \u2013 [[Nkulengu rail]]\n* ''Canirallus'' \u2013 [[grey-throated rail]]\n* ''[[Coturnicops]]'' (3 species)\n* ''Micropygia'' \u2013 [[ocellated crake]]\n* ''[[Rallicula]]'' \u2013 forest rails (4 species)\n* ''[[Rallina]]'' (4 species)\n* ''Anurolimnas'' \u2013 [[chestnut-headed crake]]\n* ''[[Laterallus]]'' (11 species)\n* ''[[Nesoclopeus]]'' (1 living species, 1 recently extinct)\n* ''[[Gallirallus]]'' \u2013 Austropacific rails (including ''Tricholimnas''; 11 living species, four recently extinct)\n* ''Diaphorapteryx'' \u2013 [[Hawkins's rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''[[Rallus]]'' \u2013 typical rails (14 species)\n* ''[[Lewinia]]'' (3 species)\n* ''[[Dryolimnas]]'' (1 living species, 1 recently extinct)\n* ''Aphanapteryx'' \u2013 [[red rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''Erythromachus'' \u2013 [[Rodrigues rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''[[Crex]]'' (2 species)\n* ''Rougetius'' \u2013 [[Rouget's rail]]\n* ''Aramidopsis'' \u2013 [[snoring rail]]\n* ''Mundia'' \u2013 [[Ascension crake]] (recently extinct)\n* ''Aphanocrex'' \u2013 [[Saint Helena Rail]] (recently extinct)\n* ''Atlantisia'' \u2013 [[Inaccessible Island rail]]\n* ''[[Aramides]]'' \u2013 wood rails (8 species)\n* ''Amaurolimnas'' \u2013 [[uniform crake]]\n* ''[[Gymnocrex]]'' (3 species)\n* ''[[Amaurornis]]'' \u2013 bush-hens (8 species)\n* ''[[Porzana]]'' \u2013 typical crakes (14 living species, 5 recently extinct)\n* ''Aenigmatolimnas'' \u2013 [[striped crake]]\n* ''Cyanolimnas'' \u2013 [[Zapata rail]]\n* ''[[Neocrex]]'' (2 species)\n* ''[[Pardirallus]]'' (3 species)\n* ''Eulabeornis'' \u2013 [[chestnut rail]]\n* ''Habroptila'' \u2013 [[invisible rail]]\n* ''Megacrex'' \u2013 [[New Guinea flightless rail]]\n* ''Gallicrex'' \u2013 [[watercock]]\n* ''[[Porphyrio]]'' \u2013 swamphens and purple gallinules (10 living species, 2 recently extinct)\n* ''[[Moorhen|Gallinula]]'' \u2013 typical gallinules (5 living species, 2 recently extinct)\n* ''Paragallinula'' \u2013 [[lesser moorhen]]\n* ''Porphyriops'' \u2013 [[spot-flanked gallinule]]\n* ''[[Tribonyx]]'' \u2013 nativehens (2 living species)\n* ''[[Coot|Fulica]]'' \u2013 coots (10 living species, one recently extinct)\n* ''[[Mustelirallus]]'' (three species)\n\nAdditionally, many prehistoric rails of extant genera are known only from [[fossil]] or subfossil remains, such as the [[Ibiza rail]] (''Rallus eivissensis'').

He also made [[breach of contract]] claims stating that he and Disney signed a contract barring Disney from using the ideas contained in his works. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n\n== Facts and procedural history ==\nIn May 2006, The Walt Disney Company released an award-winning movie called ''Cars'', based on a story about an anthropomorphic racing car whose journey transforms him from an arrogant hotshot into someone who has learned the true meaning of love, friendship, family and life. Five years after the release of the film, Jake Mandeville-Anthony filed a complaint against Walt Disney claiming that their works ''Cars'', ''Cars 2'', and ''Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales'' infringed on his copyrighted works ''Cookie'' and ''Cars Chaos''. ''Cookie'' was a story of two eccentric businessmen who won a vintage car endurance rally from London to Sydney. ''Cars Chaos'' was a television series which contained general ideas in its script about a fast, good looking car that would race in different parts of the world.<ref name=\"mandeville-anthony_v_walt-disney-pixar-ruling\">[http://www.loeb.com/files/Publication/de158486-43c2-4090-b91d-6a81eedab7b2/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/28120569-d6e1-40d3-83f9-6d3503db43e3/Mandeville-Anthony%20v.%20Disney%20opinion.pdf Civil Minutes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102161644/http://www.loeb.com/files/Publication/de158486-43c2-4090-b91d-6a81eedab7b2/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/28120569-d6e1-40d3-83f9-6d3503db43e3/Mandeville-Anthony%20v.%20Disney%20opinion.pdf |date=2013-11-02 }}, Jake Mandeville-Anthony v.

It also ruled that the plaintiff showed a justified need for the film and actual harm if he did not receive a copy of it, because he would not be able to bring a [[preliminary injunction]] motion without it.

The county was organized in 1836, and in 1837 three pioneers\u2014John Martin, John Chisom, and John Craig\u2014purchased land from Hoka, a female Chickasaw landowner, as a site for the town.<ref>Jack Lamar Mayfield. ''Oxford and Ole Miss''. Arcadia Publishing, 2009, p. 7.</ref> They named it \"Oxford\", intending to promote it as a center of learning in the [[Old Southwest]]. In 1841, the Mississippi legislature selected Oxford as the site of the state university, which opened in 1848.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Oxford was occupied by [[Union Army]] troops under Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William T. Sherman]] in 1862; in 1864 Major General [[Andrew Jackson Smith]] burned the buildings in the town square, including the county courthouse. In the postwar [[Reconstruction era]], the town recovered slowly, aided by federal judge [[Robert Andrews Hill]], who secured funds to build a new courthouse in 1872. During this period many African American [[freedman|freedmen]] moved from farms into town and established a neighborhood known as \"Freedmen Town\", where they built houses, businesses, churches and schools, and exercised all the rights of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805025400/http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |archivedate=2008-08-05 }}</ref> Even after Mississippi [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans in the [[Constitution of Mississippi|Constitution of 1890]], they continued to build their lives in the face of discrimination.\n\nDuring the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Oxford drew national attention in the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]]. State officials, including Governor [[Ross Barnett]], prevented [[James Meredith]], an African American, from enrolling at the University of Mississippi, even after the federal courts had ruled that he be admitted.  In late September 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]], following secret face-saving negotiations with Barnett, ordered [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] to accompany Meredith, while Barnett agreed to use [[Mississippi Highway Patrol]] to keep the peace. Thousands of armed \"volunteers\" flowed into the Oxford area. Meredith traveled to Oxford under armed guard to register, but riots by segregationists broke out in protest of his admittance. That evening, cars were burned, federal marshals were pelted with rocks, bricks and small arms fire, and university property was damaged by three thousand rioters. Two civilians were killed by gunshot wounds. The riot spread into adjacent areas of the city of Oxford.<ref>Doyle, William.

The region is known for its heavily forested hills made up of red clay. The area is higher and greater in relief than areas to the west (such as the [[Mississippi Delta]] or loess bluffs along the Delta), but lower in elevation than areas in northeast Mississippi. The changes in elevation can be noticed when traveling on the Highway 6 bypass, since the east-west highway tends to transect many of the north-south ridges. Downtown Oxford sits on one of these ridges and the University of Mississippi sits on another one, while the main commercial corridors on either side of the city sit in valleys.\n\nOxford is located at the confluence of highways from eight directions: [[Mississippi Highway 6]] (now co-signed with [[U.S. Route 278|US-278]]) runs west {{Convert|25|mi}} to [[Batesville, Mississippi|Batesville]] and east {{convert|31|mi}} to [[Pontotoc, Mississippi|Pontotoc]]; [[Mississippi Highway 7|Highway 7]] runs north {{convert|30|mi}} to [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] and south {{convert|18|mi}} to [[Water Valley, Mississippi|Water Valley]]. [[Mississippi Highway 30|Highway 30]] goes northeast {{convert|33|mi}} to [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]]; Highway 334 (\"Old Highway 6\") leads southeast {{convert|19|mi}} to [[Toccopola, Mississippi|Toccopola]]; Taylor Road leads southwest {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Taylor, Mississippi|Taylor]]; and Highway 314 (\"Old Sardis Road\") leads northwest, formerly to [[Sardis, Mississippi|Sardis]] but now {{convert|11|mi}} to the Clear Creek Recreation Area on [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]].\n\nThe streets in the downtown area follow a grid pattern with two [[street name|naming conventions]]. Many of the north-south streets are numbered from west to east, beginning at the old railroad depot, with numbers from four to nineteen. The place of \"Twelfth Street\", however, is taken by North and South Lamar Boulevard (formerly North Street and South Street). The east-west avenues are named for the U.S. presidents in chronological order from north to south, from [[George Washington|Washington]] to [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]]; here again, there are gaps: there is no street for [[John Quincy Adams]], who shares a last name with [[John Adams]]; \"Polk Avenue\" is replaced by University Avenue; and \"Arthur Avenue\" is lacking.\n\nOxford has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and is in [[hardiness zone]] 7b.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 492\n|1870= 1422\n|1880= 1534\n|1890= 1546\n|1900= 1820\n|1910= 2014\n|1920= 2150\n|1930= 2890\n|1940= 3433\n|1950= 3956\n|1960= 5283\n|1970= 8519\n|1980= 9882\n|1990= 9984\n|2000= 11756\n|2010= 18916\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24528\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref><br />1920-1930<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 18,916 people, with 8,648 households residing in the city.

The body of the lynched black man was then placed in the front window of a lawyer's office on the Square for several days to intimidate black Oxonians.\n\nIn addition to the historic Lafayette County Courthouse, the Square is known for an abundance of locally owned restaurants, specialty boutiques, and professional offices, along with Oxford City Hall.\n\n* The J. E. Neilson Co., located on the southeast corner of the Square, is the South's oldest documented store. Founded as a trading post in 1839, Neilson's continues to anchor the Oxford square. Neilsons (pronounced Nelsons) was one of the few stores to survive the burning of Oxford during the Civil war. It stands within eyesight of one of Oxford's two confederate statues (one was erected after the original faced south because the South \"never retreats;\" a Falkner (William added a \"U\") paid for the second). Neilson's also features a letter from William Faulkner, who repeatedly refused to pay debts owed to the department store. When the [[Great Depression]] hit Oxford and most of the banks in town closed, Neilson's acted as a surrogate bank, cashing paychecks for university employees and others. Neilson's is also the only store in Oxford to carry supplies for Boy Scout uniforms. \n* [[Square Books]], founded in 1979, is an [[independent bookstore]]. A sister store, Off Square Books, is several doors down the street to the east. It deals in used and remainder books and is the venue for a radio show called ''Thacker Mountain Radio'', with host Jim Dees, that is broadcast statewide on Mississippi Public Broadcasting. The show often draws comparisons to [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' for its mix of author readings and musical guests. A third store, Square Books Jr., deals exclusively in children's books and educational toys.\n* [[Lyric Theater (Oxford, Mississippi)|The Lyric Theater]], just off the courthouse square, is Oxford's largest music venue, with a capacity near 1200. Originally built in the late 1800s, the structure became a livery stable owned by William Faulkner's family in the early part of the 20th century. During the 1920s it became Oxford's first motion picture theater, the Lyric. In 1949, Faulkner walked from [[Rowan Oak|his home]] in Oxford to his childhood stable for the world premiere of MGM's ''Intruder in the Dust'', adapted from one of his novels. The building housed office space and a health center from the early 1980s. After extensive restoration, the Lyric reopened on 3 July 2008 as a live music venue. It also is used occasionally for film and live drama. \n* The Gertrude Castellow Ford Center for the Performing Arts on the [[University of Mississippi]]'s campus hosts a broad range of events, such as symphony performances, operas, musicals, plays, comedy tours, chamber music, and guest lectures. The Ford Center, as it is commonly known, also hosted the 2008 Presidential Debate between former President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain. \n* The [[University of Mississippi Museum]] is located on the University of Mississippi's main campus. The Robinson collection of Greek and Roman antiquities and the Millington-Barnard collection of 19th century scientific instruments are permanent collections of the museum. The museum is also home to the personal collections of Kate Skipwith and Mary Buie.

of, [[Lafayette County, Mississippi|Lafayette County]], [[Mississippi]], United States. Founded in 1837, it was named after the British university city of [[Oxford]] in hopes of having the state university located there, which it did successfully attract.\n\nAs of the 2010 US Census, the population was 18,916;<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=1600000US2854840&tid=DECENNIALSF12010.P1| title=Total Population: 2010 Census DEC Summary File 1 (P1), Oxford city, Mississippi| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| website=data.census.gov| accessdate=March 25, 2020}}</ref> the Census Bureau estimated the city's 2018 population at 24,528.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> Oxford is the home of the [[University of Mississippi]], founded in 1848, also commonly known as \"Ole Miss\".\n\n==History==\nOxford and Lafayette County were formed from lands ceded by the [[Chickasaw people]] in the [[Treaty of Pontotoc Creek]] in 1832. The county was organized in 1836, and in 1837 three pioneers\u2014John Martin, John Chisom, and John Craig\u2014purchased land from Hoka, a female Chickasaw landowner, as a site for the town.<ref>Jack Lamar Mayfield. ''Oxford and Ole Miss''. Arcadia Publishing, 2009, p. 7.</ref> They named it \"Oxford\", intending to promote it as a center of learning in the [[Old Southwest]]. In 1841, the Mississippi legislature selected Oxford as the site of the state university, which opened in 1848.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Oxford was occupied by [[Union Army]] troops under Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William T. Sherman]] in 1862; in 1864 Major General [[Andrew Jackson Smith]] burned the buildings in the town square, including the county courthouse. In the postwar [[Reconstruction era]], the town recovered slowly, aided by federal judge [[Robert Andrews Hill]], who secured funds to build a new courthouse in 1872. During this period many African American [[freedman|freedmen]] moved from farms into town and established a neighborhood known as \"Freedmen Town\", where they built houses, businesses, churches and schools, and exercised all the rights of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805025400/http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |archivedate=2008-08-05 }}</ref> Even after Mississippi [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans in the [[Constitution of Mississippi|Constitution of 1890]], they continued to build their lives in the face of discrimination.\n\nDuring the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Oxford drew national attention in the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]]. State officials, including Governor [[Ross Barnett]], prevented [[James Meredith]], an African American, from enrolling at the University of Mississippi, even after the federal courts had ruled that he be admitted.  In late September 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]], following secret face-saving negotiations with Barnett, ordered [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] to accompany Meredith, while Barnett agreed to use [[Mississippi Highway Patrol]] to keep the peace. Thousands of armed \"volunteers\" flowed into the Oxford area. Meredith traveled to Oxford under armed guard to register, but riots by segregationists broke out in protest of his admittance. That evening, cars were burned, federal marshals were pelted with rocks, bricks and small arms fire, and university property was damaged by three thousand rioters. Two civilians were killed by gunshot wounds. The riot spread into adjacent areas of the city of Oxford.<ref>Doyle, William. ''An American Insurrection: James Meredith and the Battle of Oxford, Mississippi, 1962.''

The region is known for its heavily forested hills made up of red clay. The area is higher and greater in relief than areas to the west (such as the [[Mississippi Delta]] or loess bluffs along the Delta), but lower in elevation than areas in northeast Mississippi. The changes in elevation can be noticed when traveling on the Highway 6 bypass, since the east-west highway tends to transect many of the north-south ridges. Downtown Oxford sits on one of these ridges and the University of Mississippi sits on another one, while the main commercial corridors on either side of the city sit in valleys.\n\nOxford is located at the confluence of highways from eight directions: [[Mississippi Highway 6]] (now co-signed with [[U.S. Route 278|US-278]]) runs west {{Convert|25|mi}} to [[Batesville, Mississippi|Batesville]] and east {{convert|31|mi}} to [[Pontotoc, Mississippi|Pontotoc]]; [[Mississippi Highway 7|Highway 7]] runs north {{convert|30|mi}} to [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] and south {{convert|18|mi}} to [[Water Valley, Mississippi|Water Valley]]. [[Mississippi Highway 30|Highway 30]] goes northeast {{convert|33|mi}} to [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]]; Highway 334 (\"Old Highway 6\") leads southeast {{convert|19|mi}} to [[Toccopola, Mississippi|Toccopola]]; Taylor Road leads southwest {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Taylor, Mississippi|Taylor]]; and Highway 314 (\"Old Sardis Road\") leads northwest, formerly to [[Sardis, Mississippi|Sardis]] but now {{convert|11|mi}} to the Clear Creek Recreation Area on [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]].\n\nThe streets in the downtown area follow a grid pattern with two [[street name|naming conventions]]. Many of the north-south streets are numbered from west to east, beginning at the old railroad depot, with numbers from four to nineteen. The place of \"Twelfth Street\", however, is taken by North and South Lamar Boulevard (formerly North Street and South Street). The east-west avenues are named for the U.S. presidents in chronological order from north to south, from [[George Washington|Washington]] to [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]]; here again, there are gaps: there is no street for [[John Quincy Adams]], who shares a last name with [[John Adams]]; \"Polk Avenue\" is replaced by University Avenue; and \"Arthur Avenue\" is lacking.\n\nOxford has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and is in [[hardiness zone]] 7b.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 492\n|1870= 1422\n|1880= 1534\n|1890= 1546\n|1900= 1820\n|1910= 2014\n|1920= 2150\n|1930= 2890\n|1940= 3433\n|1950= 3956\n|1960= 5283\n|1970= 8519\n|1980= 9882\n|1990= 9984\n|2000= 11756\n|2010= 18916\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24528\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref><br />1920-1930<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2010, there were 18,916 people, with 8,648 households residing in the city.

The body of the lynched black man was then placed in the front window of a lawyer's office on the Square for several days to intimidate black Oxonians.\n\nIn addition to the historic Lafayette County Courthouse, the Square is known for an abundance of locally owned restaurants, specialty boutiques, and professional offices, along with Oxford City Hall.\n\n* The J. E. Neilson Co., located on the southeast corner of the Square, is the South's oldest documented store. Founded as a trading post in 1839, Neilson's continues to anchor the Oxford square. Neilsons (pronounced Nelsons) was one of the few stores to survive the burning of Oxford during the Civil war. It stands within eyesight of one of Oxford's two confederate statues (one was erected after the original faced south because the South \"never retreats;\" a Falkner (William added a \"U\") paid for the second). Neilson's also features a letter from William Faulkner, who repeatedly refused to pay debts owed to the department store. When the [[Great Depression]] hit Oxford and most of the banks in town closed, Neilson's acted as a surrogate bank, cashing paychecks for university employees and others. Neilson's is also the only store in Oxford to carry supplies for Boy Scout uniforms. \n* [[Square Books]], founded in 1979, is an [[independent bookstore]]. A sister store, Off Square Books, is several doors down the street to the east. It deals in used and remainder books and is the venue for a radio show called ''Thacker Mountain Radio'', with host Jim Dees, that is broadcast statewide on Mississippi Public Broadcasting. The show often draws comparisons to [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' for its mix of author readings and musical guests. A third store, Square Books Jr., deals exclusively in children's books and educational toys.\n* [[Lyric Theater (Oxford, Mississippi)|The Lyric Theater]], just off the courthouse square, is Oxford's largest music venue, with a capacity near 1200. Originally built in the late 1800s, the structure became a livery stable owned by William Faulkner's family in the early part of the 20th century. During the 1920s it became Oxford's first motion picture theater, the Lyric. In 1949, Faulkner walked from [[Rowan Oak|his home]] in Oxford to his childhood stable for the world premiere of MGM's ''Intruder in the Dust'', adapted from one of his novels. The building housed office space and a health center from the early 1980s. After extensive restoration, the Lyric reopened on 3 July 2008 as a live music venue. It also is used occasionally for film and live drama. \n* The Gertrude Castellow Ford Center for the Performing Arts on the [[University of Mississippi]]'s campus hosts a broad range of events, such as symphony performances, operas, musicals, plays, comedy tours, chamber music, and guest lectures. The Ford Center, as it is commonly known, also hosted the 2008 Presidential Debate between former President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain. \n* The [[University of Mississippi Museum]] is located on the University of Mississippi's main campus. The Robinson collection of Greek and Roman antiquities and the Millington-Barnard collection of 19th century scientific instruments are permanent collections of the museum. The museum is also home to the personal collections of Kate Skipwith and Mary Buie.

L. Burnside]] and [[Junior Kimbrough]], as well as [[The Black Keys]].  [[Johnny Marr]], former [[guitarist]] for [[The Smiths]] and current member of [[Modest Mouse]] bought a home in Oxford but no longer lives in it.

{"title_page": "Standard Singaporean Mandarin", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n\nq \nIn terms of [[phonology]], [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]], Standard Singaporean Mandarin is similar to Putonghua ([[Standard Chinese]] in the People's Republic of China). Minor discrepancies appear in different vocabulary usage.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] (the [[standard language]] of China based on northern dialects) has been used as a [[lingua franca]] in Singapore alongside [[Hokkien]] (a south-eastern Chinese topolect) since the end of the Second World War. Before the standardisation of Singaporean Mandarin in the year 1979, Mandarin was largely used in a colloquial form based on the speech of Beijing, with infusions from various southern non-Mandarin [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] such as [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hainanese]] and [[Hakka]]. This colloquial form of Mandarin served as a bridge between speakers of various mutually unintelligible southern varieties. Mandarin was also the language of instruction in the now defunct Chinese-medium schools and education system. The use of Mandarin in the Chinese-medium schools led its use mainly by the Chinese-educated or Chinese elites in Singapore.\n\nAfter Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] announced and kickstarted the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] in 1979, the [[Promote Mandarin Council]] started research on Mandarin standardisation based on case studies in Mainland China and Taiwan.\n\n==Differences between standard and colloquial forms==\n\nMajor differences between Standard Singaporean Mandarin and [[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] lie in their linguistic features. Standard Singaporean Mandarin uses standard Mandarin vocabulary and grammar which are very similar to that of the Beijing standard ([[Putonghua]]), both spoken and written. Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, though based on Standard Mandarin, is often mixed with loan words and syntax from other Chinese varieties (especially those in southern China), and to a lesser extent, Malay and English. This is due to the multilingual nature of Singaporean families and society. There are also often cases when Singaporeans (due to their poorer command of Mandarin) find it hard to find or recall a Mandarin term and thus use loan words from other languages instead.\n\nThe term \"rojak\" (a Malay food used for describing \"mixture\") is most appropriate in describing colloquial Singaporean Mandarin. Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin is the equivalent of [[Singlish]] in the Mandarin speaking world of Singapore. The word \"''Singdarin''\" has been used to name the Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin also differs from colloquial Singaporean Mandarin in terms of vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation. This is because not all Singaporean Chinese speak Mandarin at home. Some could speak other Non-Mandarin Chinese varieties or English most of the time and have less exposure to Standard Mandarin. All these factors have influenced the way in which colloquial Singaporean Mandarin is formed.\n\nColloquial Singaporean Mandarin uses a variety of Southern Chinese exclamatory particles, in lieu of standard Mandarin equivalents. An example is the loan exclamatory final particle \u56c9 (''lor'') from [[Cantonese]] (analogous to Singlish usage), instead of the Mandarin exclamatory final particle \u561b/\u5440/\u554a (''ma/ya/a''):\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c31|ji\u00f9}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u662f|sh\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf4|shu\u014d}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''\u561b/\u5440/\u554a'''|'''ma/ya/a'''}}\uff01(standard)\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c31|ji\u00f9}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u662f|sh\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf4|shu\u014d}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''\u56c9'''|'''lor'''}}\uff01(colloquial)\n:\"That's what I'm saying!\"\n\nAnother example is the use of the [[Cantonese]] expression \"\u505a\u54a9\" (''zou me''):\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48|w\u00e8ish\u00e9nme}}\uff1f (standard)\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u505a|zu\u00f2}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u83ab|m\u00f2}}\uff1f (colloquial)\n:\"Why?\" / \"Doing what?\"\n\nThe exclamatory final particle \u54a7 (''leh'') from [[Hokkien]] is used in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin:\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e0d\u662f|b\u00fash\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8fd9\u6837|zh\u00e8y\u00e0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u5b50|z\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u7684|de}}\uff01 (standard)\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e0d\u662f|b\u00fash\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8fd9\u6837|zh\u00e8y\u00e0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u5b50|z\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u7684|de}}  {{ruby-zh-p|'''\u54a7'''|leh}}\uff01 (colloquial)\n:\"It's not like this!\"\n\nAnother phrase found in colloquial Mandarin is derived from the [[Hokkien]] expression ''si\u00e1\u207f-mih l\u00e2i \u00ea'' (\u5565\u7269\u4f86\u7684):\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8fd9|zh\u00e8}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u662f|sh\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|shenme}}\uff1f (standard)\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|sh\u011bnm\u00e8}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u6765|l\u00e1i}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u7684|d\u00e8}}\uff1f (colloquial)\n:\"What is this?\"\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin uses pure Mandarin words. Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, on the other hand, uses loan words from other languages. The English loan word \"then\" is commonly used in place of Mandarin word ''\u624d'' in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin. Again, a loan exclamatory final particle \u56c9 (''lor'') from [[Cantonese]] is used instead of Mandarin exclamatory final particle \u554a/\u5440 (''a/ya'').

The written form of Chinese used in Singapore is also based on this standard. Standard Singaporean Mandarin is also the register of Mandarin used by the Chinese elites of Singapore and is easily distinguishable from the [[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] spoken by the general populace.\n \nIn terms of [[phonology]], [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]], Standard Singaporean Mandarin is similar to Putonghua ([[Standard Chinese]] in the People's Republic of China). Minor discrepancies appear in different vocabulary usage.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] (the [[standard language]] of China based on northern dialects) has been used as a [[lingua franca]] in Singapore alongside [[Hokkien]] (a south-eastern Chinese topolect) since the end of the Second World War. Before the standardisation of Singaporean Mandarin in the year 1979, Mandarin was largely used in a colloquial form based on the speech of Beijing, with infusions from various southern non-Mandarin [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] such as [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hainanese]] and [[Hakka]]. This colloquial form of Mandarin served as a bridge between speakers of various mutually unintelligible southern varieties. Mandarin was also the language of instruction in the now defunct Chinese-medium schools and education system. The use of Mandarin in the Chinese-medium schools led its use mainly by the Chinese-educated or Chinese elites in Singapore.\n\nAfter Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] announced and kickstarted the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] in 1979, the [[Promote Mandarin Council]] started research on Mandarin standardisation based on case studies in Mainland China and Taiwan.\n\n==Differences between standard and colloquial forms==\n\nMajor differences between Standard Singaporean Mandarin and [[Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin]] lie in their linguistic features. Standard Singaporean Mandarin uses standard Mandarin vocabulary and grammar which are very similar to that of the Beijing standard ([[Putonghua]]), both spoken and written. Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, though based on Standard Mandarin, is often mixed with loan words and syntax from other Chinese varieties (especially those in southern China), and to a lesser extent, Malay and English. This is due to the multilingual nature of Singaporean families and society. There are also often cases when Singaporeans (due to their poorer command of Mandarin) find it hard to find or recall a Mandarin term and thus use loan words from other languages instead.\n\nThe term \"rojak\" (a Malay food used for describing \"mixture\") is most appropriate in describing colloquial Singaporean Mandarin. Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin is the equivalent of [[Singlish]] in the Mandarin speaking world of Singapore. The word \"''Singdarin''\" has been used to name the Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin also differs from colloquial Singaporean Mandarin in terms of vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation. This is because not all Singaporean Chinese speak Mandarin at home. Some could speak other Non-Mandarin Chinese varieties or English most of the time and have less exposure to Standard Mandarin. All these factors have influenced the way in which colloquial Singaporean Mandarin is formed.\n\nColloquial Singaporean Mandarin uses a variety of Southern Chinese exclamatory particles, in lieu of standard Mandarin equivalents. An example is the loan exclamatory final particle \u56c9 (''lor'') from [[Cantonese]] (analogous to Singlish usage), instead of the Mandarin exclamatory final particle \u561b/\u5440/\u554a (''ma/ya/a''):\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c31|ji\u00f9}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u662f|sh\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf4|shu\u014d}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''\u561b/\u5440/\u554a'''|'''ma/ya/a'''}}\uff01(standard)\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c31|ji\u00f9}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u662f|sh\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf4|shu\u014d}} {{ruby-zh-p|'''\u56c9'''|'''lor'''}}\uff01(colloquial)\n:\"That's what I'm saying!\"\n\nAnother example is the use of the [[Cantonese]] expression \"\u505a\u54a9\" (''zou me''):\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48|w\u00e8ish\u00e9nme}}\uff1f (standard)\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u505a|zu\u00f2}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u83ab|m\u00f2}}\uff1f (colloquial)\n:\"Why?\" / \"Doing what?\"\n\nThe exclamatory final particle \u54a7 (''leh'') from [[Hokkien]] is used in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin:\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e0d\u662f|b\u00fash\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8fd9\u6837|zh\u00e8y\u00e0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u5b50|z\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u7684|de}}\uff01 (standard)\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e0d\u662f|b\u00fash\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8fd9\u6837|zh\u00e8y\u00e0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u5b50|z\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u7684|de}}  {{ruby-zh-p|'''\u54a7'''|leh}}\uff01 (colloquial)\n:\"It's not like this!\"\n\nAnother phrase found in colloquial Mandarin is derived from the [[Hokkien]] expression ''si\u00e1\u207f-mih l\u00e2i \u00ea'' (\u5565\u7269\u4f86\u7684):\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8fd9|zh\u00e8}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u662f|sh\u00ec}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|shenme}}\uff1f (standard)\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|sh\u011bnm\u00e8}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u6765|l\u00e1i}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u7684|d\u00e8}}\uff1f (colloquial)\n:\"What is this?\"\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin uses pure Mandarin words. Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, on the other hand, uses loan words from other languages. The English loan word \"then\" is commonly used in place of Mandarin word ''\u624d'' in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin. Again, a loan exclamatory final particle \u56c9 (''lor'') from [[Cantonese]] is used instead of Mandarin exclamatory final particle \u554a/\u5440 (''a/ya'').

Based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|1999 novel of the same name]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Claire Danes]], [[Charlie Cox]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Robert De Niro]], with narration by [[Ian McKellen]].\n\nThe film follows Tristan, a young man from the fictional town of Wall in the [[United Kingdom]]. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his crush Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. He collects the star who, to his surprise, is a woman named Yvaine. [[Witches]] and the Princes of Stormhold are also hunting for Yvaine. Meanwhile, Tristan tries to get her back to Wall with him before Victoria's birthday, the deadline of her offer.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews and grossed $137 million on a $70\u201388.5 million budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> In 2008, it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].<ref name=\"hugo\" /> ''Stardust'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] on December 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\nThe English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A guard prevents anyone from crossing. Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. He meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass [[snowdrop]] in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying the baby's name is Tristan.\n\nEighteen years later, the dying King of Stormhold throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that his successor will be the first of his [[fratricidal]] sons to recover it. The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the now clear gem.\n\nIn Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she left for him, which can take the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He chains her to bring her to Victoria.\n\nThree ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.\n\nYvaine becomes tired, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to bring food. In his absence, a [[unicorn]] releases her, but unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone, but the stars whisper that she is in danger, telling him to get on a passing coach, which happens to be Primus'. At the inn, they interrupt Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine use the Babylon candle to escape into the clouds, where they are captured by [[Air pirate|pirates]] in a flying ship. The leader, Captain Shakespeare, befriends Tristan and Yvaine, teaching Tristan how to [[fencing|fence]] and Yvaine how to dance.\n\nSeptimus discovers that as the last surviving son, he needs only find the stone to claim the throne. He learns it is in the possession of the fallen star and realizes that the heart of a star grants [[immortality]].\n\nAfter leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine confess their love for one another and spend the night together at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall with a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria he will not marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and rushes back to save her.\n\nYvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the [[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|caravan]] of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to stop her. Lamia kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.\n\nSeptimus and Tristan kill two of the witches, but Lamia uses a [[voodoo doll]] to kill Septimus. Lamia is about to finish Tristan off, when she appears to break down over the loss of her sisters. Lamia frees Yvaine, but her feigned defeat was a ruse, and she tries to kill them both. As Tristan and Yvaine embrace, their love allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia.\n\nTristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. As the jewel turns red, Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. He becomes king with Yvaine as his queen while Dunstan and Una are reunited. After eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where they live together as stars.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Yvaine, the fallen star\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Tristan Thorn\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lamia\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Prince Septimus\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Shakespeare of the ''Caspartine''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Prince Primus\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Prince Secundus\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Ferdiland \"Ferdy\" the [[Fence (criminal)|Fence]]\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Victoria Forester\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as the dying King of Stormhold\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Narrator\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Princess Una\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Mormo, Lamia's sister\n* [[Sarah Alexander]] as Empusa,  Lamia's other sister\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Prince Tertius\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as the ghost of Prince Quartus\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as the ghost of Prince Quintus\n* [[David Walliams]] as the ghost of Prince Sextus\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Dunstan Thorn\n** [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as a young Dunstan Thorn\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Humphrey, Victoria's boyfriend\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as the Wall Guard\n* [[Melanie Hill]] as Ditchwater Sal\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Billy, the Goat converted into human form\n* [[Jake Curran]] as Bernard\n** [[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] as Bernard's female form\n* [[George Innes]] as the Soothsayer\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as the Skinny Pirate\n* [[Eliot Sumner|Eliot (Coco) Sumner]] as Ingrid, Yvaine's sister\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as the New Bishop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' is an [[Fantasy literature|illustrated fantasy story]] created by [[Neil Gaiman]], with art by [[Charles Vess]].

Encouraged by publisher Avon Gaiman decided to adapt ''Stardust'' and in 1999 it was republished as a conventional novel in hardback without illustrations. Gaiman has compared the story to a fantasy version of the 1934 romantic comedy film ''[[It Happened One Night]]''.<ref name=\"den-10\" /><ref name=\"aintitcool\" />\n\nIn 1998 ''Stardust'' was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] for a film adaptation by [[Bob Weinstein]] at [[Miramax]].

Gilliam dropped out following his involvement with ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'' not wanting to do another fairytale. Vaughn left to produce ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' but became the director for the first time on that project. After Vaughn withdrew from helming the film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' talks resumed and in January 2005, Vaughn acquired the option to develop the [[film adaptation]].<ref>{{cite news | date=16 January 2005 | author=Adam Dawtrey | url= https://variety.com/2005/film/columns/vaughn-pushes-ahead-with-u-n-c-l-e-feature-1117916360/ | title= Vaughn pushes ahead with 'U.N.C.L.E.' feature | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date= 2019-07-23 }}</ref> In October 2005, the director entered final negotiations with [[Paramount Pictures]] to direct and produce ''Stardust'' with a budget estimated at {{US$}}70 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/1566862/stardust-author-neil-gaiman-tells-why-he-turns-down-most-adaptations-but-not-this-one/ | title='Stardust' Author Neil Gaiman Tells Why He Turns Down Most Adaptations \u2013 But Not This One | publisher=MTV | date=10 August 2007 | access-date=2008-02-14 }}</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe adapted screenplay was written by Vaughn and screenwriter [[Jane Goldman]] who had been recommended by Gaiman.<ref name=\"latimes-adams\" /><ref name=\"aintitcool\" /> When asked how the book inspired his vision for the film, Vaughn said that he wanted \"to do ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|Princess Bride]]'' with a ''[[Midnight Run]]'' overtone.\"<ref name=\"superherohype\">{{cite web |date= 2 August 2007 |last= Douglas |first= Edward |title=Exclusive: Stardust Director Matthew Vaughn |publisher=Superherohype.com |url= https://www.superherohype.com/features/94533-exclusive-stardust-director-matthew-vaughn |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160114033149/https://www.superherohype.com/features/94533-exclusive-stardust-director-matthew-vaughn |archive-date= 2016-01-14 |url-status= dead |access-date= 2019-07-24 }}</ref> One of the difficulties with adapting the novel was its earnest and dark nature: an adult fairy tale in which sex and violence are presented unflinchingly. As a result of changes, the movie version has a greater element of whimsy and humour, with Gaiman's blessing given to the screenwriters.

Budgetary concerns also factored into the adaptation, even with the level of 2006 technology.<ref name=\"Brooke Tarnoff\" /> The character Captain Shakespeare was expanded extensively from the novel, and the character Ferdy the Fence was created for the film. \n\nVaughn and Goldman decided that the witches needed names (as in the book they were collectively the [[Lilim]] and their names were lost beneath the sea); their [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] decisions included names also found in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (Empusa) and ''[[Neverwhere]]'' (Lamia).<ref>{{cite web | first = Neil | last = Gaiman | title = Neil Gaiman's Journal: April 2006 | url= http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061115080729/http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2006_04_01_archive.html | archive-date = 15 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn the film's differences from the novel, Gaiman commented: \"I sort of feel like my grounding in comics was actually very useful because in my head, that's just the [[Earth-Two]] version of ''Stardust''.

directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and co-written by Vaughn and [[Jane Goldman]]. Based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|1999 novel of the same name]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Claire Danes]], [[Charlie Cox]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Robert De Niro]], with narration by [[Ian McKellen]].\n\nThe film follows Tristan, a young man from the fictional town of Wall in the [[United Kingdom]]. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his crush Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. He collects the star who, to his surprise, is a woman named Yvaine. [[Witches]] and the Princes of Stormhold are also hunting for Yvaine. Meanwhile, Tristan tries to get her back to Wall with him before Victoria's birthday, the deadline of her offer.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews and grossed $137 million on a $70\u201388.5 million budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> In 2008, it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].<ref name=\"hugo\" /> ''Stardust'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] on December 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\nThe English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A guard prevents anyone from crossing. Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. He meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass [[snowdrop]] in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying the baby's name is Tristan.\n\nEighteen years later, the dying King of Stormhold throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that his successor will be the first of his [[fratricidal]] sons to recover it. The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the now clear gem.\n\nIn Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she left for him, which can take the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He chains her to bring her to Victoria.\n\nThree ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.\n\nYvaine becomes tired, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to bring food. In his absence, a [[unicorn]] releases her, but unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone, but the stars whisper that she is in danger, telling him to get on a passing coach, which happens to be Primus'. At the inn, they interrupt Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine use the Babylon candle to escape into the clouds, where they are captured by [[Air pirate|pirates]] in a flying ship. The leader, Captain Shakespeare, befriends Tristan and Yvaine, teaching Tristan how to [[fencing|fence]] and Yvaine how to dance.\n\nSeptimus discovers that as the last surviving son, he needs only find the stone to claim the throne. He learns it is in the possession of the fallen star and realizes that the heart of a star grants [[immortality]].\n\nAfter leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine confess their love for one another and spend the night together at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall with a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria he will not marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and rushes back to save her.\n\nYvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the [[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|caravan]] of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to stop her. Lamia kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.\n\nSeptimus and Tristan kill two of the witches, but Lamia uses a [[voodoo doll]] to kill Septimus. Lamia is about to finish Tristan off, when she appears to break down over the loss of her sisters. Lamia frees Yvaine, but her feigned defeat was a ruse, and she tries to kill them both. As Tristan and Yvaine embrace, their love allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia.\n\nTristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. As the jewel turns red, Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. He becomes king with Yvaine as his queen while Dunstan and Una are reunited. After eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where they live together as stars.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Yvaine, the fallen star\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Tristan Thorn\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lamia\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Prince Septimus\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Shakespeare of the ''Caspartine''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Prince Primus\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Prince Secundus\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Ferdiland \"Ferdy\" the [[Fence (criminal)|Fence]]\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Victoria Forester\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as the dying King of Stormhold\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Narrator\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Princess Una\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Mormo, Lamia's sister\n* [[Sarah Alexander]] as Empusa,  Lamia's other sister\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Prince Tertius\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as the ghost of Prince Quartus\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as the ghost of Prince Quintus\n* [[David Walliams]] as the ghost of Prince Sextus\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Dunstan Thorn\n** [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as a young Dunstan Thorn\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Humphrey, Victoria's boyfriend\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as the Wall Guard\n* [[Melanie Hill]] as Ditchwater Sal\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Billy, the Goat converted into human form\n* [[Jake Curran]] as Bernard\n** [[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] as Bernard's female form\n* [[George Innes]] as the Soothsayer\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as the Skinny Pirate\n* [[Eliot Sumner|Eliot (Coco) Sumner]] as Ingrid, Yvaine's sister\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as the New Bishop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' is an [[Fantasy literature|illustrated fantasy story]] created by [[Neil Gaiman]], with art by [[Charles Vess]].
