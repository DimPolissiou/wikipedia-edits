{"title_page": "Turnpikes of Oklahoma", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n[[Image:Ok-hwy-sys.png|thumb|350px|right|Oklahoma highway system, with turnpikes shown in green]]\nOklahoma has an extensive '''turnpike system''', maintained by the state government through the [[Oklahoma Turnpike Authority]]. All of Oklahoma's [[toll road|turnpikes]] are [[controlled-access highways]]. The majority have at least four lanes, though the Chickasaw Turnpike is [[Two-lane expressway|two lanes]].\n\nTolls on Oklahoma's turnpikes are collected through several methods, particular to each turnpike, involving mainline and sidegate toll plazas. Tolls can be paid through cash (at either unmanned exact-change bays or manned booths, depending on the plaza) or through the Pikepass transponder system.\n\n==Turnpikes==\n*The [[Cherokee Turnpike]] is part of [[U.S. Route 412 in Oklahoma|U.S. Highway 412]] (US-412) in eastern Oklahoma,\n*The [[Chickasaw Turnpike]] connects [[U.S. Route 177 in Oklahoma|US-177]] just north of [[Sulphur, Oklahoma|Sulphur]] to [[Oklahoma State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] (SH-1) south of [[Ada, Oklahoma|Ada]]. The turnpike is two lanes for its entire length.\n*The [[Cimarron Turnpike]] begins at [[Interstate 35 in Oklahoma|Interstate 35]] (I-35) in [[Noble County, Oklahoma|Noble County]] (east of [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]]) and ends in the western suburbs of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. The turnpike is part of US-412. It  also has a spur to the southwest to US-177 north of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]].\n*The [[Creek Turnpike]] runs around the outskirts of Tulsa, forming a southern bypass of Tulsa's core area. The Creek Turnpike terminates at [[Interstate 44 in Oklahoma|I-44]] on both ends, and acts as a bridge between the Turner and Will Rogers Turnpikes.\n*The [[H. E. Bailey Turnpike]] serves southwestern Oklahoma and is part of I-44. The H.E. Bailey turnpike has two separate parts, with a free section running through eastern [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. This turnpike connects [[Wichita Falls, Texas]] to Lawton, [[Chickasha]], and [[Oklahoma City]]. It has a spur to the east, the Norman Spur, towards [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] and [[Goldsby, Oklahoma|Goldsby]].\n*The [[Indian Nation Turnpike]] passes through southeast Oklahoma, beginning at [[Hugo, Oklahoma|Hugo]] and angling northwest to end at [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|I-40]] south of [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]].\n*The [[Kilpatrick Turnpike]] runs through the north and west sides of the Oklahoma City metro, running from I-40 to I-35/I-44, where it becomes the Turner Turnpike. This route acts as one quarter of a pseudo-[[beltway]], proving access to the suburbs of [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]] and [[Edmond, Oklahoma|Edmond]]. An extension to [[Oklahoma State Highway 152|SH-152]] is planned to start construction sometime in late 2016.\n*The [[Muskogee Turnpike]] begins at [[Oklahoma State Highway 51|SH-51]] in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma|Broken Arrow]] and continues southeast to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]]. A second section of the turnpike connects Muskogee to I-40 at [[Webbers Falls, Oklahoma|Webbers Falls]]. The two sections are connected by a freeway, carrying part of [[Oklahoma State Highway 165|SH-165]].\n*The [[Turner Turnpike]] was Oklahoma's first turnpike, connecting Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The Turner Turnpike parallels historic [[U.S. Route 66 in Oklahoma|US-66]] (now [[Oklahoma State Highway 66|SH-66]]), and carries I-44.\n*The [[Will Rogers Turnpike]] connects Tulsa to the [[Missouri]] state line near [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]. Like the Turner Turnpike, this turnpike serves as a parallel route to US-66 and carries I-44. The rest area near [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]] is promoted as containing the [[McDonald's (Will Rogers Turnpike)|World's Largest McDonald's]].\n\n===Surveyed but not built===\nShortly after the Turner Turnpike was built in 1953, the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority proposed other toll roads including one to be built from Oklahoma City north to the Kansas border near Braman to tie in with the southern terminus of the Kansas Turnpike at the state line. That routing was included as part of the Federal Highway Act of 1956 which created the Interstate Highway System. As a result, the OTA could not obtain financing to build that proposed turnpike and turned the initial plans including surveys and blueprints over to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation in 1956 for the construction of [[Interstate 35 in Oklahoma|I-35]] as a freeway on that same alignment, which was completed in several stages between 1958 and 1962.\n\nAlso proposed but never built was a toll road roughly following what would later become I-35 between Oklahoma City and the Red River north of Gainesville, Texas that included a spur route veering from the main route north of Ardmore veering northeastward past Ada to tie in with the Turner Turnpike near [[Stroud, Oklahoma]].\n\nAlso proposed in the 1990s but never built was an extension of the Muskogee Turnpike from its current southeastern terminus at [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|I-40]] southeastward toward [[Poteau, Oklahoma|Poteau]].\n\n==Pikepass==\n'''Pikepass''' is the [[electronic toll collection]] system used by the [[Oklahoma Turnpike Authority]]. Created in 1990 and launched on January 1, 1991, Pikepass provides a faster and cheaper alternative in paying cash tolls. The authority also saves millions with the system.<ref>{{cite news |date = November 17, 1990 |url = http://tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=175361 |title = Toll Booths Going High-Tech |work = Tulsa World |first = Janet |last = Pearson |accessdate = June 14, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Most customers pay an initial $40 in prepaid tolls, which they can refill at their own convenience or have funds automatically withdrawn to replenish the account if it falls below $10\u201315.

New turnpike corridors included in the package are a {{convert|adj=on|2+1/2|mi|km}} tolled extension of the [[Gilcrease Expressway]] in Tulsa; the [[Kickapoo Turnpike]], a  {{convert|adj=on|21|mi|km}} connection between [[I-40 (OK)|I-40]] and the Turner Turnpike in eastern [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]]; and a {{convert|adj=on|7|mi|km}} extension of the Kilpatrick Turnpike southeast to [[SH-152 (OK)|SH-152]] near [[Will Rogers World Airport]] in Oklahoma City. The package also provides funding for safety improvement projects on the H.E. Bailey, Muskogee, and Turner turnpikes.

All of Oklahoma's [[toll road|turnpikes]] are [[controlled-access highways]]. The majority have at least four lanes, though the Chickasaw Turnpike is [[Two-lane expressway|two lanes]].\n\nTolls on Oklahoma's turnpikes are collected through several methods, particular to each turnpike, involving mainline and sidegate toll plazas. Tolls can be paid through cash (at either unmanned exact-change bays or manned booths, depending on the plaza) or through the Pikepass transponder system.\n\n==Turnpikes==\n*The [[Cherokee Turnpike]] is part of [[U.S. Route 412 in Oklahoma|U.S. Highway 412]] (US-412) in eastern Oklahoma,\n*The [[Chickasaw Turnpike]] connects [[U.S. Route 177 in Oklahoma|US-177]] just north of [[Sulphur, Oklahoma|Sulphur]] to [[Oklahoma State Highway 1|State Highway 1]] (SH-1) south of [[Ada, Oklahoma|Ada]]. The turnpike is two lanes for its entire length.\n*The [[Cimarron Turnpike]] begins at [[Interstate 35 in Oklahoma|Interstate 35]] (I-35) in [[Noble County, Oklahoma|Noble County]] (east of [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]]) and ends in the western suburbs of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. The turnpike is part of US-412. It  also has a spur to the southwest to US-177 north of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]].\n*The [[Creek Turnpike]] runs around the outskirts of Tulsa, forming a southern bypass of Tulsa's core area. The Creek Turnpike terminates at [[Interstate 44 in Oklahoma|I-44]] on both ends, and acts as a bridge between the Turner and Will Rogers Turnpikes.\n*The [[H. E. Bailey Turnpike]] serves southwestern Oklahoma and is part of I-44. The H.E. Bailey turnpike has two separate parts, with a free section running through eastern [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. This turnpike connects [[Wichita Falls, Texas]] to Lawton, [[Chickasha]], and [[Oklahoma City]]. It has a spur to the east, the Norman Spur, towards [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] and [[Goldsby, Oklahoma|Goldsby]].\n*The [[Indian Nation Turnpike]] passes through southeast Oklahoma, beginning at [[Hugo, Oklahoma|Hugo]] and angling northwest to end at [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|I-40]] south of [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]].\n*The [[Kilpatrick Turnpike]] runs through the north and west sides of the Oklahoma City metro, running from I-40 to I-35/I-44, where it becomes the Turner Turnpike. This route acts as one quarter of a pseudo-[[beltway]], proving access to the suburbs of [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]] and [[Edmond, Oklahoma|Edmond]]. An extension to [[Oklahoma State Highway 152|SH-152]] is planned to start construction sometime in late 2016.\n*The [[Muskogee Turnpike]] begins at [[Oklahoma State Highway 51|SH-51]] in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma|Broken Arrow]] and continues southeast to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]]. A second section of the turnpike connects Muskogee to I-40 at [[Webbers Falls, Oklahoma|Webbers Falls]]. The two sections are connected by a freeway, carrying part of [[Oklahoma State Highway 165|SH-165]].\n*The [[Turner Turnpike]] was Oklahoma's first turnpike, connecting Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The Turner Turnpike parallels historic [[U.S. Route 66 in Oklahoma|US-66]] (now [[Oklahoma State Highway 66|SH-66]]), and carries I-44.\n*The [[Will Rogers Turnpike]] connects Tulsa to the [[Missouri]] state line near [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]]. Like the Turner Turnpike, this turnpike serves as a parallel route to US-66 and carries I-44. The rest area near [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]] is promoted as containing the [[McDonald's (Will Rogers Turnpike)|World's Largest McDonald's]].\n\n===Surveyed but not built===\nShortly after the Turner Turnpike was built in 1953, the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority proposed other toll roads including one to be built from Oklahoma City north to the Kansas border near Braman to tie in with the southern terminus of the Kansas Turnpike at the state line. That routing was included as part of the Federal Highway Act of 1956 which created the Interstate Highway System. As a result, the OTA could not obtain financing to build that proposed turnpike and turned the initial plans including surveys and blueprints over to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation in 1956 for the construction of [[Interstate 35 in Oklahoma|I-35]] as a freeway on that same alignment, which was completed in several stages between 1958 and 1962.\n\nAlso proposed but never built was a toll road roughly following what would later become I-35 between Oklahoma City and the Red River north of Gainesville, Texas that included a spur route veering from the main route north of Ardmore veering northeastward past Ada to tie in with the Turner Turnpike near [[Stroud, Oklahoma]].\n\nAlso proposed in the 1990s but never built was an extension of the Muskogee Turnpike from its current southeastern terminus at [[Interstate 40 in Oklahoma|I-40]] southeastward toward [[Poteau, Oklahoma|Poteau]].\n\n==Pikepass==\n'''Pikepass''' is the [[electronic toll collection]] system used by the [[Oklahoma Turnpike Authority]]. Created in 1990 and launched on January 1, 1991, Pikepass provides a faster and cheaper alternative in paying cash tolls. The authority also saves millions with the system.<ref>{{cite news |date = November 17, 1990 |url = http://tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=175361 |title = Toll Booths Going High-Tech |work = Tulsa World |first = Janet |last = Pearson |accessdate = June 14, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Most customers pay an initial $40 in prepaid tolls, which they can refill at their own convenience or have funds automatically withdrawn to replenish the account if it falls below $10\u201315.

It was posited to explain the occurrence of nouns and verbs in Slavic languages which are invariantly accented on the [[Inflection|inflectional ending]]. The latter is seen as an innovation from the original [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Proto-Balto-Slavic]] accent system, in which nouns and verbs either had invariable accent on the root, or \"mobile\" accent which could alternate between root and ending in the inflectional paradigm.{{sfnp|Olander|2009|pp=31\u201332; 140\u2013143}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{see|Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Accent paradigms}}\nAccording to the law, the accent was shifted rightward from a non-acute syllable (i.e. a long circumflex syllable, or a short syllable) to the following syllable if the word belonged to the [[fixed paradigm|fixed accentual paradigm]]. This produced the difference between the later accent classes A and B. The length of the previously-accented syllable remains.\n\nThe preservation of the original length is the primary source of pre-tonic length in the later Slavic languages (e.g. [[Serbo-Croatian]]), because inherited Balto-Slavic vowel length had previously been shortened in pre-tonic syllables, without a change in vowel quality. This caused the phonemicization of the previously automatic quality variations between short and long vowels \u2014 e.g. short *o vs. originally long *a.\n\n===Valence theory===\nThe Moscow accentological school considers the Dybo\u2013Illich-Svitych's law not as a one-time change, but as a multi-stage process in various Late Proto-Slavic dialects, with successive removal of accent drift prohibitions to the right.{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=16; 18}} There are two prohibitions, common to all Late Proto-Slavic dialects:{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}}\n* Prohibition on the right-side accent shift from syllables with a [[Proto-Slavic accent#Valence theory|dominant acute]] \u2013 {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u017eaba|*\u02c8\u017ea\u030bba\u030b}} AP (a), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*agoda|*\u02c8ja\u030bgoda\u030b}} AP (a).{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}}\n* Prohibition on the shift of the accent on syllables with a [[Proto-Slavic accent#Valence theory|dominant circumflex]] \u2013 {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*slu\u017eiti|*\u02c8sl\u0169\u017e\u0129t\u044c}} AP (b\u2081), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*nositi|*\u02c8n\u00f2s\u0129t\u044c}} AP (b\u2081), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*no\u017eik\u044a|*\u02c8n\u00f2\u017e\u0129k\u044a}} AP (b).{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}}\n\nCommon Slavic (most likely Balto-Slavic) is also considered a shift of accent on internal syllables, as well as on some endings with a [[Proto-Slavic accent#Valence theory|dominant a\u0441ut\u0435]] \u2013 {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u017eena|*\u017e\u00e8\u02c8na\u030b}} AP (b), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*tvoriti|*tv\u00f2\u02c8ri\u030bti}} AP (b\u2082), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*slu\u017eiti|*sl\u0169\u02c8\u017ei\u030bti}} AP (b\u2081).{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}} This phenomenon does not apply to the Dybo\u2013Illich-Svitych's law, because the shift is found in all Late Proto-Slavic dialects, and therefore acted earlier in time.{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=15}}\n\n====Dialects of the III group{{clarify|date=April 2020}}====\nCommon for [[Sclaveni|Slovenian]]{{clarify|reason=Why does this point to \"Sclaveni\" and not \"Slovenian language\"?|date=April 2020}}:\n* Prohibition on shifting accent from long syllables to subsequent long syllables or [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107|Kri\u017eani\u0107's law]].{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=19}}\n\n==Examples==\nWord-final syllables with the [[Proto-Balto-Slavic#Accent and the acute register|Balto-Slavic acute register]] were shortened and then lost the acute, before the time Dybo's law operated. It could then be lengthened again by [[Van Wijk's law]], producing a long non-acuted vowel. Therefore, when the accent shifted onto a final syllable, the new accent was either circumflex or short, but never acute.\n\nWhen the new accent was circumflex or fell on a [[yer]], the accent was subsequently shifted leftward again by [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]] (a.k.a. Stang's law), resulting in a [[neoacute]] accent:\n* Early Slavic ''*p\u00edrstu'' \"finger\" > MCS ''*p\u044c\u0311rst\u044a'' > (Dybo's law) ''*p\u044c\u0304rst\u044a\u0300'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*p\u044c\u0303rst\u044a'' > obsolete Russian ''perst'', [[genitive case|gen]] [[grammatical number|sg]] ''perst\u00e1''\n* Early Slavic ''*k\u00e1tu'' \"cat\" > MCS ''*k\u020dt\u044a'' > (Dybo's law) ''*kot\u044a\u0300'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*k\u00f5t\u044a''> Russian ''kot'', [[genitive case|gen]] [[grammatical number|sg]] ''kot\u00e1''\n* Early Slavic ''*v\u00e1lj\u0101\u02c0'' \"will\" > (loss of acute) MCS ''*v\u020flja'' > (Van Wijk's law) ''*v\u020flj\u0101'' > (Dybo's law) ''*v\u014dlj\u0203'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*v\u00f5lja'' > Russian ''v\u00f3lja'', Slovak ''v\u00f4\u013ea'' (note, Slovak ''\u00f4'' {{IPA|[u\u032fo]}} specifically reflects neoacute)\n\nWhen the new accent was short (either from an original short vowel or a shortened acute) and Van Wijk's law did not apply, then Iv\u0161i\u0107's law had no effect, and the accent remained on the second syllable:\n\n* Early Slavic ''*g\u00e9n\u0101\u02c0'' \"woman\" > (loss of acute) Middle Common Slavic (MCS) ''*\u017e\u0205na'' > (Dybo's law) Late Common Slavic (LCS) ''*\u017een\u00e0'' > [[Chakavian]] ''\u017een\u0201''\n* Latin ''v\u012bnum'' \"wine\" > MCS ''*v\u020bno'' > (Dybo's law) LCS *v\u012bn\u00f2 > Serbo-Croatian ''v\u00edno'' (with long rising accent, indicating [[neoshtokavian]] accent retraction from the following syllable)\n\nThe acute was preserved in non-final syllables, however. Thus, when shifting onto a non-final syllable, all three accents (acute, circumflex or short) were possible, depending on the state of the syllable before Dybo's law operated.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jay Jasanoff]]|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|page=57}}</ref> Iv\u0161i\u0107's law in turn operated on forms where the new accent was circumflex, but not where it was acute or short. Compare:\n* Early Slavic infinitive ''*pr\u00e1s\u012b\u02c0t\u012b'' > MCS ''*pr\u00f3s\u012b\u02c0t\u012b'' > (Dybo's law) LCS ''*prosi\u030bti''.\n* Early Slavic 3sg. present ''*pr\u00e1s\u012bti'' > MCS ''*pr\u00f3s\u012bt\u044c'' > (Dybo's law) LCS ''*pros\u020bt\u044c'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) ''*pr\u00f2sit\u044c''.\n\nDybo's law was entirely prevented in cases of initial accent in words belonging to the mobile accent paradigm. In such forms, [[Meillet's law]] resulted in loss of the acute register on the root, so that all initial-accented mobile forms were in principle susceptible to Dybo's law. Jasanoff argues that such forms had a special \"left-marginal accent\", which was not affected by Dybo's law the way the \"lexical accent\" of fixed-accent paradigms was.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jay Jasanoff]]|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|page=60}}</ref> Thus:\n* Early Slavic ''*v\u00e1d\u0101n'' \"water\" acc. sg. > MCS ''*v\u020dd\u01eb'' > LCS ''*v\u020dd\u01eb'' > Russian ''v\u00f3du'', SC ''v\u020ddu''\n* Early Slavic ''*g\u00e1l\u02c0v\u0101n'' \"head\" acc. sg. > (Meillet's law) MCS ''*g\u020flv\u01eb'' > LCS ''*g\u020flv\u01eb'' > Russian ''g\u00f3lovu'', SC ''gl\u0203vu''\n\n==Comparison with De Saussure's law==\n[[De Saussure's law]] is a sound law very similar to Dybo's that affected [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Like Dybo's law, it caused a rightward shift of the accent from non-acuted syllables and a split in the original accentual paradigms. There are some differences, however:\n* Dybo's law shifted the accent rightward regardless of what was in the next syllable, whereas De Saussure's law shifted it only when it was acuted.\n* Dybo's law was blocked in mobile-accented words. Such words never had an acute in the first syllable as a result of [[Meillet's law]], but they nonetheless retained the initial accent. Consequently, there was only a split into three paradigms, with the fixed-accented words splitting into paradigms ''a'' and ''b'', but the mobile-accented words remaining unified under paradigm ''c''.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |title=\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0433\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b: \u0422\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0441. |author-link=Vladimir Dybo |first=Vladimir |last=Dybo |url= |format= |location=[[Moscow]] |publisher=\u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b |id= |volume=1 |year=2000 |pages=736 |language=Russian |isbn=5-7859-0140-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Dybo |first1=V.

It was posited to explain the occurrence of nouns and verbs in Slavic languages which are invariantly accented on the [[Inflection|inflectional ending]]. The latter is seen as an innovation from the original [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Proto-Balto-Slavic]] accent system, in which nouns and verbs either had invariable accent on the root, or \"mobile\" accent which could alternate between root and ending in the inflectional paradigm.{{sfnp|Olander|2009|pp=31\u201332; 140\u2013143}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{see|Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Accent paradigms}}\nAccording to the law, the accent was shifted rightward from a non-acute syllable (i.e. a long circumflex syllable, or a short syllable) to the following syllable if the word belonged to the [[fixed paradigm|fixed accentual paradigm]]. This produced the difference between the later accent classes A and B. The length of the previously-accented syllable remains.\n\nThe preservation of the original length is the primary source of pre-tonic length in the later Slavic languages (e.g. [[Serbo-Croatian]]), because inherited Balto-Slavic vowel length had previously been shortened in pre-tonic syllables, without a change in vowel quality. This caused the phonemicization of the previously automatic quality variations between short and long vowels \u2014 e.g. short *o vs. originally long *a.\n\n===Valence theory===\nThe Moscow accentological school considers the Dybo\u2013Illich-Svitych's law not as a one-time change, but as a multi-stage process in various Late Proto-Slavic dialects, with successive removal of accent drift prohibitions to the right.{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=16; 18}} There are two prohibitions, common to all Late Proto-Slavic dialects:{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}}\n* Prohibition on the right-side accent shift from syllables with a [[Proto-Slavic accent#Valence theory|dominant acute]] \u2013 {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u017eaba|*\u02c8\u017ea\u030bba\u030b}} AP (a), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*agoda|*\u02c8ja\u030bgoda\u030b}} AP (a).{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}}\n* Prohibition on the shift of the accent on syllables with a [[Proto-Slavic accent#Valence theory|dominant circumflex]] \u2013 {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*slu\u017eiti|*\u02c8sl\u0169\u017e\u0129t\u044c}} AP (b\u2081), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*nositi|*\u02c8n\u00f2s\u0129t\u044c}} AP (b\u2081), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*no\u017eik\u044a|*\u02c8n\u00f2\u017e\u0129k\u044a}} AP (b).{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}}\n\nCommon Slavic (most likely Balto-Slavic) is also considered a shift of accent on internal syllables, as well as on some endings with a [[Proto-Slavic accent#Valence theory|dominant a\u0441ut\u0435]] \u2013 {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u017eena|*\u017e\u00e8\u02c8na\u030b}} AP (b), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*tvoriti|*tv\u00f2\u02c8ri\u030bti}} AP (b\u2082), {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*slu\u017eiti|*sl\u0169\u02c8\u017ei\u030bti}} AP (b\u2081).{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=18}} This phenomenon does not apply to the Dybo\u2013Illich-Svitych's law, because the shift is found in all Late Proto-Slavic dialects, and therefore acted earlier in time.{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=15}}\n\n====Dialects of the III group{{clarify|date=April 2020}}====\nCommon for [[Sclaveni|Slovenian]]{{clarify|reason=Why does this point to \"Sclaveni\" and not \"Slovenian language\"?|date=April 2020}}:\n* Prohibition on shifting accent from long syllables to subsequent long syllables or [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107|Kri\u017eani\u0107's law]].{{sfnp|Dybo|Zamyatina|Nikolaev|1993|p=19}}\n\n==Examples==\nWord-final syllables with the [[Proto-Balto-Slavic#Accent and the acute register|Balto-Slavic acute register]] were shortened and then lost the acute, before the time Dybo's law operated. It could then be lengthened again by [[Van Wijk's law]], producing a long non-acuted vowel. Therefore, when the accent shifted onto a final syllable, the new accent was either circumflex or short, but never acute.\n\nWhen the new accent was circumflex or fell on a [[yer]], the accent was subsequently shifted leftward again by [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]] (a.k.a. Stang's law), resulting in a [[neoacute]] accent:\n* Early Slavic ''*p\u00edrstu'' \"finger\" > MCS ''*p\u044c\u0311rst\u044a'' > (Dybo's law) ''*p\u044c\u0304rst\u044a\u0300'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*p\u044c\u0303rst\u044a'' > obsolete Russian ''perst'', [[genitive case|gen]] [[grammatical number|sg]] ''perst\u00e1''\n* Early Slavic ''*k\u00e1tu'' \"cat\" > MCS ''*k\u020dt\u044a'' > (Dybo's law) ''*kot\u044a\u0300'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*k\u00f5t\u044a''> Russian ''kot'', [[genitive case|gen]] [[grammatical number|sg]] ''kot\u00e1''\n* Early Slavic ''*v\u00e1lj\u0101\u02c0'' \"will\" > (loss of acute) MCS ''*v\u020flja'' > (Van Wijk's law) ''*v\u020flj\u0101'' > (Dybo's law) ''*v\u014dlj\u0203'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) LCS ''*v\u00f5lja'' > Russian ''v\u00f3lja'', Slovak ''v\u00f4\u013ea'' (note, Slovak ''\u00f4'' {{IPA|[u\u032fo]}} specifically reflects neoacute)\n\nWhen the new accent was short (either from an original short vowel or a shortened acute) and Van Wijk's law did not apply, then Iv\u0161i\u0107's law had no effect, and the accent remained on the second syllable:\n\n* Early Slavic ''*g\u00e9n\u0101\u02c0'' \"woman\" > (loss of acute) Middle Common Slavic (MCS) ''*\u017e\u0205na'' > (Dybo's law) Late Common Slavic (LCS) ''*\u017een\u00e0'' > [[Chakavian]] ''\u017een\u0201''\n* Latin ''v\u012bnum'' \"wine\" > MCS ''*v\u020bno'' > (Dybo's law) LCS *v\u012bn\u00f2 > Serbo-Croatian ''v\u00edno'' (with long rising accent, indicating [[neoshtokavian]] accent retraction from the following syllable)\n\nThe acute was preserved in non-final syllables, however. Thus, when shifting onto a non-final syllable, all three accents (acute, circumflex or short) were possible, depending on the state of the syllable before Dybo's law operated.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jay Jasanoff]]|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|page=57}}</ref> Iv\u0161i\u0107's law in turn operated on forms where the new accent was circumflex, but not where it was acute or short. Compare:\n* Early Slavic infinitive ''*pr\u00e1s\u012b\u02c0t\u012b'' > MCS ''*pr\u00f3s\u012b\u02c0t\u012b'' > (Dybo's law) LCS ''*prosi\u030bti''.\n* Early Slavic 3sg. present ''*pr\u00e1s\u012bti'' > MCS ''*pr\u00f3s\u012bt\u044c'' > (Dybo's law) LCS ''*pros\u020bt\u044c'' > (Iv\u0161i\u0107's law) ''*pr\u00f2sit\u044c''.\n\nDybo's law was entirely prevented in cases of initial accent in words belonging to the mobile accent paradigm. In such forms, [[Meillet's law]] resulted in loss of the acute register on the root, so that all initial-accented mobile forms were in principle susceptible to Dybo's law. Jasanoff argues that such forms had a special \"left-marginal accent\", which was not affected by Dybo's law the way the \"lexical accent\" of fixed-accent paradigms was.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Jay Jasanoff]]|title=The Prehistory of the Balto-Slavic Accent|page=60}}</ref> Thus:\n* Early Slavic ''*v\u00e1d\u0101n'' \"water\" acc. sg. > MCS ''*v\u020dd\u01eb'' > LCS ''*v\u020dd\u01eb'' > Russian ''v\u00f3du'', SC ''v\u020ddu''\n* Early Slavic ''*g\u00e1l\u02c0v\u0101n'' \"head\" acc. sg. > (Meillet's law) MCS ''*g\u020flv\u01eb'' > LCS ''*g\u020flv\u01eb'' > Russian ''g\u00f3lovu'', SC ''gl\u0203vu''\n\n==Comparison with De Saussure's law==\n[[De Saussure's law]] is a sound law very similar to Dybo's that affected [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Like Dybo's law, it caused a rightward shift of the accent from non-acuted syllables and a split in the original accentual paradigms. There are some differences, however:\n* Dybo's law shifted the accent rightward regardless of what was in the next syllable, whereas De Saussure's law shifted it only when it was acuted.\n* Dybo's law was blocked in mobile-accented words. Such words never had an acute in the first syllable as a result of [[Meillet's law]], but they nonetheless retained the initial accent. Consequently, there was only a split into three paradigms, with the fixed-accented words splitting into paradigms ''a'' and ''b'', but the mobile-accented words remaining unified under paradigm ''c''.\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |title=\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0433\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b: \u0422\u0438\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0441. |author-link=Vladimir Dybo |first=Vladimir |last=Dybo |url= |format= |location=[[Moscow]] |publisher=\u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b |id= |volume=1 |year=2000 |pages=736 |language=Russian |isbn=5-7859-0140-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Dybo |first1=V.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted.

[[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c.

The meaning of the word, ''[[Divan (furniture)|divan]]'' \"long, cushioned seat\" is due to such seats having been found along the walls in Middle Eastern council chambers.  It is a common surname among Sikhs in Punjab. <ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=divan</ref>\n\n== Council ==\nThe word first appears under the [[Caliphate]] of [[`Umar ibn al-Khatt\u0101b|Omar I]] (A.D. 634&ndash;644).

The Republicans managed to maintain their majority of state governorships, but it was reduced to a margin of only two seats. The elections were notable for the sheer number of state governorships that changed parties \u2013 20 in total, constituting more than half of the seats up for election. Additionally, a number of Democratic and Republican gains occurred in states that typically favor the other party; for instance, Republican candidates won the usually Democratic states of Maryland, Hawaii, Minnesota and Vermont, while Democratic governors were elected in Republican-leaning states like Wyoming, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Kansas. \n\nIn addition to the elections held in 36 [[U.S. state|states]], elections were also held in the [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territories]] of [[Guam]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "{{about|Sexual slavery in Islam|  other uses| Islam and slavery (disambiguation) }}\n{{italic title}}\n'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she became an ''umm walad'' her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} If someone bought a woman, he could not separate her child from her until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women.

Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n\nIn the late 19th century some Indian Muslim modernists rejected the legitimacy of slavery in Islam.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=262}} This reformist take on slavery was a part of regenerated Indian Muslim thinking in the 1860s and 1870s.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=264}} [[Syed Ahmad Khan]] and Amir Ali were primarily concerned with refuting Western criticism of Islamic slavery. However, they did not directly refute the European criticism about female slavery and concubinage.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=269}} According to Dilawar Husain Ahmad polygamy and concubinage were responsible for \"Muslim decline.\"{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=275}} [[Chiragh Ali]] denied the Quranic permission for concubinage.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=277}} However, he accepted [[William Muir]]'s view that Muslims would not abandon female slavery willingly, but he asserted that Muslim jurists did not allow concubinage with the female slaves being imported from Africa, [[Central Asia]] and Georgia in that time. However, he did not specify who these Islamic jurists were.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=278}} Syed Ahmad Khan was opposed by the ulama on a number of issues, including his views on slavery.{{sfn|Powell|2006|p=275}}\n\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave even those men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} After 1882 the Egyptian ulama refused to prohibit slavery on the grounds that the Prophet had never forbidden it. In 1899 a scholar from  [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad al-Bulayqi implicitly defended concubinage and refuted modernist arguments.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=139}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi in Mombasa ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J.

The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam.

In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally.

However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears. She turns to her loved ones, milk pouring forth from her breast: \"Go in peace, my darlings, and may God accompany you.\"|[[Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam]], [[Robert G. Hoyland]]{{sfn|Hoyland|1997|p=262}}}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she became an ''umm walad'' her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} If someone bought a woman, he could not separate her child from her until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women.

The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her.

The [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] is conical and pointed. It is composed of six or seven [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s. The [[body whorl]] is much larger than all the others.
