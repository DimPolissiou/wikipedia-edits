The county was organized in 1836, and in 1837 three pioneers\u2014John Martin, John Chisom, and John Craig\u2014purchased land from Hoka, a female Chickasaw landowner, as a site for the town.<ref>Jack Lamar Mayfield. ''Oxford and Ole Miss''. Arcadia Publishing, 2009, p. 7.</ref> They named it \"Oxford\", intending to promote it as a center of learning in the [[Old Southwest]]. In 1841, the Mississippi legislature selected Oxford as the site of the state university, which opened in 1848.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Oxford was occupied by [[Union Army]] troops under Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William T. Sherman]] in 1862; in 1864 Major General [[Andrew Jackson Smith]] burned the buildings in the town square, including the county courthouse. In the postwar [[Reconstruction era]], the town recovered slowly, aided by federal judge [[Robert Andrews Hill]], who secured funds to build a new courthouse in 1872. During this period many African American [[freedman|freedmen]] moved from farms into town and established a neighborhood known as \"Freedmen Town\", where they built houses, businesses, churches and schools, and exercised all the rights of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805025400/http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |archivedate=2008-08-05 }}</ref> Even after Mississippi [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans in the [[Constitution of Mississippi|Constitution of 1890]], they continued to build their lives in the face of discrimination.\n\nDuring the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Oxford drew national attention in the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]]. State officials, including Governor [[Ross Barnett]], prevented [[James Meredith]], an African American, from enrolling at the University of Mississippi, even after the federal courts had ruled that he be admitted.  In late September 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]], following secret face-saving negotiations with Barnett, ordered [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] to accompany Meredith, while Barnett agreed to use [[Mississippi Highway Patrol]] to keep the peace. Thousands of armed \"volunteers\" flowed into the Oxford area. Meredith traveled to Oxford under armed guard to register, but riots by segregationists broke out in protest of his admittance. That evening, cars were burned, federal marshals were pelted with rocks, bricks and small arms fire, and university property was damaged by three thousand rioters. Two civilians were killed by gunshot wounds. The riot spread into adjacent areas of the city of Oxford.<ref>Doyle, William.

The region is known for its heavily forested hills made up of red clay. The area is higher and greater in relief than areas to the west (such as the [[Mississippi Delta]] or loess bluffs along the Delta), but lower in elevation than areas in northeast Mississippi. The changes in elevation can be noticed when traveling on the Highway 6 bypass, since the east-west highway tends to transect many of the north-south ridges. Downtown Oxford sits on one of these ridges and the University of Mississippi sits on another one, while the main commercial corridors on either side of the city sit in valleys.\n\nOxford is located at the confluence of highways from eight directions: [[Mississippi Highway 6]] (now co-signed with [[U.S. Route 278|US-278]]) runs west {{Convert|25|mi}} to [[Batesville, Mississippi|Batesville]] and east {{convert|31|mi}} to [[Pontotoc, Mississippi|Pontotoc]]; [[Mississippi Highway 7|Highway 7]] runs north {{convert|30|mi}} to [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] and south {{convert|18|mi}} to [[Water Valley, Mississippi|Water Valley]]. [[Mississippi Highway 30|Highway 30]] goes northeast {{convert|33|mi}} to [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]]; Highway 334 (\"Old Highway 6\") leads southeast {{convert|19|mi}} to [[Toccopola, Mississippi|Toccopola]]; Taylor Road leads southwest {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Taylor, Mississippi|Taylor]]; and Highway 314 (\"Old Sardis Road\") leads northwest, formerly to [[Sardis, Mississippi|Sardis]] but now {{convert|11|mi}} to the Clear Creek Recreation Area on [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]].\n\nThe streets in the downtown area follow a grid pattern with two [[street name|naming conventions]]. Many of the north-south streets are numbered from west to east, beginning at the old railroad depot, with numbers from four to nineteen. The place of \"Twelfth Street\", however, is taken by North and South Lamar Boulevard (formerly North Street and South Street). The east-west avenues are named for the U.S. presidents in chronological order from north to south, from [[George Washington|Washington]] to [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]]; here again, there are gaps: there is no street for [[John Quincy Adams]], who shares a last name with [[John Adams]]; \"Polk Avenue\" is replaced by University Avenue; and \"Arthur Avenue\" is lacking.\n\nOxford has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and is in [[hardiness zone]] 7b.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 492\n|1870= 1422\n|1880= 1534\n|1890= 1546\n|1900= 1820\n|1910= 2014\n|1920= 2150\n|1930= 2890\n|1940= 3433\n|1950= 3956\n|1960= 5283\n|1970= 8519\n|1980= 9882\n|1990= 9984\n|2000= 11756\n|2010= 18916\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24528\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref><br />1920-1930<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2010, there were 18,916 people, with 8,648 households residing in the city.

A historical marker stands where it once stood.\n* [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II|L.Q.C. Lamar]] (1825\u20131893), U.S. senator and supreme court justice, resided in Oxford, where he served as professor of mathematics at the University of Mississippi, farmed, and practiced law. He was the son-in-law of university chancellor [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet]]. Lamar's home in Oxford was restored as a museum in 2008.\n* [[Naomi Sims]] (1948-2009), fashion model, was born in Oxford.\n* [[New York Giants]] quarterback [[Eli Manning]], who played college football at [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]], lives in Oxford during the off-season. His father, former Ole Miss and [[New Orleans Saints]] quarterback [[Archie Manning]], owns a condominium in Oxford.\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE LIST!

It features a confederate statue next to its courthouse, which was designed by the same architect that designed the statue in Holly Springs, Mississippi. It was erected in 1907.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordeagle.com/2017/09/27/oxford-confederate-statues-monuments-dead-white-supremacy/|title=Confederate statues in Oxford, Mississippi\u2014Monuments to the dead or to white supremacy?|website=Oxfordeagle.com|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2020}}</ref> The last person to be lynched in Oxford, around 1936, was dragged behind a car from \"three-way\", currently a four-way intersection on North Lamar, a prominent road which now is connected to Molly Bar, another prominent road in Oxford. The body of the lynched black man was then placed in the front window of a lawyer's office on the Square for several days to intimidate black Oxonians.\n\nIn addition to the historic Lafayette County Courthouse, the Square is known for an abundance of locally owned restaurants, specialty boutiques, and professional offices, along with Oxford City Hall.\n\n* The J. E. Neilson Co., located on the southeast corner of the Square, is the South's oldest documented store. Founded as a trading post in 1839, Neilson's continues to anchor the Oxford square. Neilsons (pronounced Nelsons) was one of the few stores to survive the burning of Oxford during the Civil war. It stands within eyesight of one of Oxford's two confederate statues (one was erected after the original faced south because the South \"never retreats;\" a Falkner (William added a \"U\") paid for the second). Neilson's also features a letter from William Faulkner, who repeatedly refused to pay debts owed to the department store. When the [[Great Depression]] hit Oxford and most of the banks in town closed, Neilson's acted as a surrogate bank, cashing paychecks for university employees and others. Neilson's is also the only store in Oxford to carry supplies for Boy Scout uniforms. \n* [[Square Books]], founded in 1979, is an [[independent bookstore]]. A sister store, Off Square Books, is several doors down the street to the east. It deals in used and remainder books and is the venue for a radio show called ''Thacker Mountain Radio'', with host Jim Dees, that is broadcast statewide on Mississippi Public Broadcasting. The show often draws comparisons to [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' for its mix of author readings and musical guests. A third store, Square Books Jr., deals exclusively in children's books and educational toys.\n* [[Lyric Theater (Oxford, Mississippi)|The Lyric Theater]], just off the courthouse square, is Oxford's largest music venue, with a capacity near 1200. Originally built in the late 1800s, the structure became a livery stable owned by William Faulkner's family in the early part of the 20th century. During the 1920s it became Oxford's first motion picture theater, the Lyric. In 1949, Faulkner walked from [[Rowan Oak|his home]] in Oxford to his childhood stable for the world premiere of MGM's ''Intruder in the Dust'', adapted from one of his novels. The building housed office space and a health center from the early 1980s. After extensive restoration, the Lyric reopened on 3 July 2008 as a live music venue. It also is used occasionally for film and live drama. \n* The Gertrude Castellow Ford Center for the Performing Arts on the [[University of Mississippi]]'s campus hosts a broad range of events, such as symphony performances, operas, musicals, plays, comedy tours, chamber music, and guest lectures. The Ford Center, as it is commonly known, also hosted the 2008 Presidential Debate between former President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain. \n* The [[University of Mississippi Museum]] is located on the University of Mississippi's main campus. The Robinson collection of Greek and Roman antiquities and the Millington-Barnard collection of 19th century scientific instruments are permanent collections of the museum. The museum is also home to the personal collections of Kate Skipwith and Mary Buie. The permanent exhibits are free to the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://museum.olemiss.edu/|title=University Museum \u2014|website=Museum.olemiss.edu|accessdate=February 2, 2020}}</ref>\n* The Burns-Belfry Museum was previously the Burns Methodist Episcopal Church organized by freed African Americans in 1910. Now, the museum pays tribute to its role in the Civil War era. The museum houses a permanent exhibit on African American history that spans from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burns-belfry.com/|title=Untitled Document|website=Burns-belfry.com|accessdate=February 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Cultural ==\n* Oxford has had a diverse music scene for many years. Oxford's relatively close proximity to large music cities such as [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], influence its musical stylings. Musicians past and present living in Oxford include [[Beanland (band)|Beanland]], [[The Cooters (band)|The Cooters]], [[Bass Drum of Death]], [[Kudzu Kings]], [[Blue Mountain (band)|Blue Mountain]], [[George McConnell]], [[Caroline Herring]] and blues harp player [[Adam Gussow]].\n* Oxford is also the home of the renegade [[blues]] label [[Fat Possum Records]], who released records by blues legends [[R. L. Burnside]] and [[Junior Kimbrough]], as well as [[The Black Keys]].  [[Johnny Marr]], former [[guitarist]] for [[The Smiths]] and current member of [[Modest Mouse]] bought a home in Oxford but no longer lives in it.  Former [[Derek and the Dominos]] member [[Bobby Whitlock]] lived in Oxford where he had a ranch and his own studio.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n* Musicians [[Modest Mouse]], [[Gavin Degraw]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Hives]], and [[Counting Crows]] have recorded albums at [[Sweet Tea Recording Studio]] in Oxford. Dennis Herring, the owner of Sweet Tea, has received Grammy awards for his work with artists such as [[Jars of Clay]] and blues great [[Buddy Guy]].\n* [[Bob Dylan]] wrote a song called \"[[Oxford Town]]\", which was included on his album [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]. The song was about the violent events surrounding the admission of [[James Meredith]] into the [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962. Dylan played a memorable concert at the Tad Smith Coliseum on the Ole Miss campus in November 1990, which opened with a performance of the song ''Oxford Town''.\n* Oxford has been the setting for numerous movies, including ''[[Intruder in the Dust (1949 film)|Intruder in the Dust]]'' (1949, based on the [[Intruder in the Dust|Faulkner novel]]), ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''Barn Burning'' (1980, based on the [[Barn Burning|Faulkner short story]]), ''Rush'' (1981 documentary), ''[[Heart of Dixie (film)|Heart of Dixie]]'' (1989), ''[[The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag]]'' (1992), ''Glorious Mail'' (2005), ''Sorry, We're Open'' (2008 documentary), ''The Night of the Loup Garou'' (2009), ''Where I Begin'' (2010), and parts of ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1997).\n* American journalist and novelist [[Joan Didion]] mentions Oxford in her collection of essays [[The White Album (book)]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Didion |first1=Joan |title=The white album |isbn=0374532079 |edition=Paperback [reissue]ition}}</ref>\n\n== Historic sites==\nSee also [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Lafayette County, Mississippi]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas S.

The county was organized in 1836, and in 1837 three pioneers\u2014John Martin, John Chisom, and John Craig\u2014purchased land from Hoka, a female Chickasaw landowner, as a site for the town.<ref>Jack Lamar Mayfield. ''Oxford and Ole Miss''. Arcadia Publishing, 2009, p. 7.</ref> They named it \"Oxford\", intending to promote it as a center of learning in the [[Old Southwest]]. In 1841, the Mississippi legislature selected Oxford as the site of the state university, which opened in 1848.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Oxford was occupied by [[Union Army]] troops under Generals [[Ulysses S.

In the postwar [[Reconstruction era]], the town recovered slowly, aided by federal judge [[Robert Andrews Hill]], who secured funds to build a new courthouse in 1872. During this period many African American [[freedman|freedmen]] moved from farms into town and established a neighborhood known as \"Freedmen Town\", where they built houses, businesses, churches and schools, and exercised all the rights of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805025400/http://www.historymarkersofms.com/Lafayette/Freedmen_Town.JPG |archivedate=2008-08-05 }}</ref> Even after Mississippi [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most African Americans in the [[Constitution of Mississippi|Constitution of 1890]], they continued to build their lives in the face of discrimination.\n\nDuring the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Oxford drew national attention in the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]]. State officials, including Governor [[Ross Barnett]], prevented [[James Meredith]], an African American, from enrolling at the University of Mississippi, even after the federal courts had ruled that he be admitted.  In late September 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]], following secret face-saving negotiations with Barnett, ordered [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] to accompany Meredith, while Barnett agreed to use [[Mississippi Highway Patrol]] to keep the peace. Thousands of armed \"volunteers\" flowed into the Oxford area. Meredith traveled to Oxford under armed guard to register, but riots by segregationists broke out in protest of his admittance. That evening, cars were burned, federal marshals were pelted with rocks, bricks and small arms fire, and university property was damaged by three thousand rioters. Two civilians were killed by gunshot wounds. The riot spread into adjacent areas of the city of Oxford.<ref>Doyle, William.

The region is known for its heavily forested hills made up of red clay. The area is higher and greater in relief than areas to the west (such as the [[Mississippi Delta]] or loess bluffs along the Delta), but lower in elevation than areas in northeast Mississippi. The changes in elevation can be noticed when traveling on the Highway 6 bypass, since the east-west highway tends to transect many of the north-south ridges. Downtown Oxford sits on one of these ridges and the University of Mississippi sits on another one, while the main commercial corridors on either side of the city sit in valleys.\n\nOxford is located at the confluence of highways from eight directions: [[Mississippi Highway 6]] (now co-signed with [[U.S. Route 278|US-278]]) runs west {{Convert|25|mi}} to [[Batesville, Mississippi|Batesville]] and east {{convert|31|mi}} to [[Pontotoc, Mississippi|Pontotoc]]; [[Mississippi Highway 7|Highway 7]] runs north {{convert|30|mi}} to [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] and south {{convert|18|mi}} to [[Water Valley, Mississippi|Water Valley]]. [[Mississippi Highway 30|Highway 30]] goes northeast {{convert|33|mi}} to [[New Albany, Mississippi|New Albany]]; Highway 334 (\"Old Highway 6\") leads southeast {{convert|19|mi}} to [[Toccopola, Mississippi|Toccopola]]; Taylor Road leads southwest {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Taylor, Mississippi|Taylor]]; and Highway 314 (\"Old Sardis Road\") leads northwest, formerly to [[Sardis, Mississippi|Sardis]] but now {{convert|11|mi}} to the Clear Creek Recreation Area on [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]].\n\nThe streets in the downtown area follow a grid pattern with two [[street name|naming conventions]]. Many of the north-south streets are numbered from west to east, beginning at the old railroad depot, with numbers from four to nineteen. The place of \"Twelfth Street\", however, is taken by North and South Lamar Boulevard (formerly North Street and South Street). The east-west avenues are named for the U.S. presidents in chronological order from north to south, from [[George Washington|Washington]] to [[Grover Cleveland|Cleveland]]; here again, there are gaps: there is no street for [[John Quincy Adams]], who shares a last name with [[John Adams]]; \"Polk Avenue\" is replaced by University Avenue; and \"Arthur Avenue\" is lacking.\n\nOxford has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and is in [[hardiness zone]] 7b.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 492\n|1870= 1422\n|1880= 1534\n|1890= 1546\n|1900= 1820\n|1910= 2014\n|1920= 2150\n|1930= 2890\n|1940= 3433\n|1950= 3956\n|1960= 5283\n|1970= 8519\n|1980= 9882\n|1990= 9984\n|2000= 11756\n|2010= 18916\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=24528\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref><br />1920-1930<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=June 13, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2010, there were 18,916 people, with 8,648 households residing in the city.

Lamar]] (1825\u20131893), U.S. senator and supreme court justice, resided in Oxford, where he served as professor of mathematics at the University of Mississippi, farmed, and practiced law.

The body of the lynched black man was then placed in the front window of a lawyer's office on the Square for several days to intimidate black Oxonians.\n\nIn addition to the historic Lafayette County Courthouse, the Square is known for an abundance of locally owned restaurants, specialty boutiques, and professional offices, along with Oxford City Hall.\n\n* The J. E. Neilson Co., located on the southeast corner of the Square, is the South's oldest documented store. Founded as a trading post in 1839, Neilson's continues to anchor the Oxford square. Neilsons (pronounced Nelsons) was one of the few stores to survive the burning of Oxford during the Civil war. It stands within eyesight of one of Oxford's two confederate statues (one was erected after the original faced south because the South \"never retreats;\" a Falkner (William added a \"U\") paid for the second). Neilson's also features a letter from William Faulkner, who repeatedly refused to pay debts owed to the department store. When the [[Great Depression]] hit Oxford and most of the banks in town closed, Neilson's acted as a surrogate bank, cashing paychecks for university employees and others. Neilson's is also the only store in Oxford to carry supplies for Boy Scout uniforms. \n* [[Square Books]], founded in 1979, is an [[independent bookstore]]. A sister store, Off Square Books, is several doors down the street to the east. It deals in used and remainder books and is the venue for a radio show called ''Thacker Mountain Radio'', with host Jim Dees, that is broadcast statewide on Mississippi Public Broadcasting. The show often draws comparisons to [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' for its mix of author readings and musical guests. A third store, Square Books Jr., deals exclusively in children's books and educational toys.\n* [[Lyric Theater (Oxford, Mississippi)|The Lyric Theater]], just off the courthouse square, is Oxford's largest music venue, with a capacity near 1200. Originally built in the late 1800s, the structure became a livery stable owned by William Faulkner's family in the early part of the 20th century. During the 1920s it became Oxford's first motion picture theater, the Lyric. In 1949, Faulkner walked from [[Rowan Oak|his home]] in Oxford to his childhood stable for the world premiere of MGM's ''Intruder in the Dust'', adapted from one of his novels. The building housed office space and a health center from the early 1980s. After extensive restoration, the Lyric reopened on 3 July 2008 as a live music venue. It also is used occasionally for film and live drama. \n* The Gertrude Castellow Ford Center for the Performing Arts on the [[University of Mississippi]]'s campus hosts a broad range of events, such as symphony performances, operas, musicals, plays, comedy tours, chamber music, and guest lectures. The Ford Center, as it is commonly known, also hosted the 2008 Presidential Debate between former President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain. \n* The [[University of Mississippi Museum]] is located on the University of Mississippi's main campus. The Robinson collection of Greek and Roman antiquities and the Millington-Barnard collection of 19th century scientific instruments are permanent collections of the museum. The museum is also home to the personal collections of Kate Skipwith and Mary Buie. The permanent exhibits are free to the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://museum.olemiss.edu/|title=University Museum \u2014|website=Museum.olemiss.edu|accessdate=February 2, 2020}}</ref>\n* The Burns-Belfry Museum was previously the Burns Methodist Episcopal Church organized by freed African Americans in 1910. Now, the museum pays tribute to its role in the Civil War era.

Oxford's relatively close proximity to large music cities such as [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], influence its musical stylings. Musicians past and present living in Oxford include [[Beanland (band)|Beanland]], [[The Cooters (band)|The Cooters]], [[Bass Drum of Death]], [[Kudzu Kings]], [[Blue Mountain (band)|Blue Mountain]], [[George McConnell]], [[Caroline Herring]] and blues harp player [[Adam Gussow]].\n* Oxford is also the home of the renegade [[blues]] label [[Fat Possum Records]], who released records by blues legends [[R. L. Burnside]] and [[Junior Kimbrough]], as well as [[The Black Keys]].  [[Johnny Marr]], former [[guitarist]] for [[The Smiths]] and current member of [[Modest Mouse]] bought a home in Oxford but no longer lives in it.  Former [[Derek and the Dominos]] member [[Bobby Whitlock]] lived in Oxford where he had a ranch and his own studio.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n* Musicians [[Modest Mouse]], [[Gavin Degraw]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Hives]], and [[Counting Crows]] have recorded albums at [[Sweet Tea Recording Studio]] in Oxford. Dennis Herring, the owner of Sweet Tea, has received Grammy awards for his work with artists such as [[Jars of Clay]] and blues great [[Buddy Guy]].\n* [[Bob Dylan]] wrote a song called \"[[Oxford Town]]\", which was included on his album [[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]. The song was about the violent events surrounding the admission of [[James Meredith]] into the [[University of Mississippi]] in 1962. Dylan played a memorable concert at the Tad Smith Coliseum on the Ole Miss campus in November 1990, which opened with a performance of the song ''Oxford Town''.\n* Oxford has been the setting for numerous movies, including ''[[Intruder in the Dust (1949 film)|Intruder in the Dust]]'' (1949, based on the [[Intruder in the Dust|Faulkner novel]]), ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''Barn Burning'' (1980, based on the [[Barn Burning|Faulkner short story]]), ''Rush'' (1981 documentary), ''[[Heart of Dixie (film)|Heart of Dixie]]'' (1989), ''[[The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag]]'' (1992), ''Glorious Mail'' (2005), ''Sorry, We're Open'' (2008 documentary), ''The Night of the Loup Garou'' (2009), ''Where I Begin'' (2010), and parts of ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1997).\n* American journalist and novelist [[Joan Didion]] mentions Oxford in her collection of essays [[The White Album (book)]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Didion |first1=Joan |title=The white album |isbn=0374532079 |edition=Paperback [reissue]ition}}</ref>\n\n== Historic sites==\nSee also [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Lafayette County, Mississippi]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas S.
