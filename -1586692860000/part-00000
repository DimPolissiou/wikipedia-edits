These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre.

Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume.

Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in Kerala. Another version of the story says that the Sri Lankan king sent eight martial families to Kerala at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted in Kerala against him.<ref name=\"ezh9\"/>{{clarify|reason=please can we see a translation of the relevant content on the talk page&nbsp;\u2014 thanks.|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

Itti Achuden's texts were written in the [[Kolezhuthu]] script that Ezhava castes used, for they were prevented from learning the more Sanskritized Aryazuthu script which was the preserve of the upper-castes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Indigenous Knowledge and the Significance of South-West India for Portuguese and Dutch Constructions of Tropical Nature |first=Richard |last=Grove |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=30 |issue=1 |date=February 1996 |pages= 121\u2013143|jstor=312903 |doi=10.1017/s0026749x00014104}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas practiced ayurvedic medicine.<ref name=\"Alan Bicker 2000 9\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FS7dkOgNGT0C&pg=PA9|title= Indigenous environmental knowledge and its transformations|page=9|first=RF Ellen Peter Parkes |last=Alan Bicker|publisher=Routledge |year=2000|accessdate=2011-06-15|isbn= 9789057024832}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XJ2HHZcM6oC&pg=PA83|title= Ecological Journeys |page=82|first=Madhav |last=Gadgil|publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2005|accessdate=2011-06-15|isbn= 9788178241128 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwNUblS-jpwC&pg=PA3120|title= Modern World System and Indian Proto-Industrialization  |page=312|first=Abhay Kumar |last=Singh|publisher=Northern book center |year=2006|accessdate=2011-06-15|isbn= 9788172112011 }}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Channaar Musicians 19th century.jpg|thumbnail|150px|Ezhava/Channar Musicians from the 19th century: Performing the traditional \"Villadichaampattu\"]]\n\n===Aivar kali===\nLiterally, Aivarkali means the play of the five sets.  This was a ritualistic art form performed in almost all important temples of Kerala.  Today it is found in central Kerala.  This is also known as Pandavarkali, which means the play of the Pandavas, (the five heroes of the ''[[Mahabharatha]]''), and is performed by Asari, Moosari, Karuvan, Thattan and Kallasari communities. This ritualistic dance is performed beneath a decorated pandal with a [[nilavilakku]] at its centre. The five or more performers with their leader called Kaliachan enter the performance area after a ritualistic bath, with sandalwood paste over their foreheads, dressed in white dhoti, and with a towel wrapped around their heads.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Arjuna Nrtam (Mayilppili Tukkam)===\n\n[[Mayilpeeli Thookkam|Arjuna Nrtam]] (\"the dance of [[Arjuna]]\") or Mayilppili Tukkam is a ritual art performed by men of Ezhava community and is prevalent in the [[Bhagavathy]] temples of south Kerala, mainly in [[Kollam]], Alappuzha and [[Kottayam]] districts. Arjuna nritham is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" as the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are closely similar to [[Kalarippayattu]] techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all night performance of the dance form is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of [[snake worship]] and [[Kalarippayattu]].<ref name = \"ezh22\"/><ref name = \"ezh23\"/>\n\n===Poorakkali===\nPoorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of [[Meenam]] (March\u2013April).  Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu, a system of physical exercise formerly in vogue in Kerala.  Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>\n\n===Teyyam (Teyyattam) or Kaliyattam===\nIn northern Kerala, [[Theyyam|Teyyam]] is a popular [[ritual dance]]. This particular dance form is also known as Kaliyattam. The main deities of Ezhavas include Vayanattu Kulavan, Kativannur Viran, Pumarutan and [[Muthappan|Muttappan]].<ref name = \"ezh22\">{{cite book | author = Bernier, Ronald M. | title = Temple Arts of Kerala: A South Indian Tradition | publisher = Asia Book Corporation of America | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-940500-79-2 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}<ref name = \"ezh23\">{{cite book | last=Chaitanya |first=Krishna | title=Arts of India | publisher=Abhinav Publications |location=New Delhi | year=1987 | isbn=978-81-7017-209-3 }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Customs==\nEzhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across [[Kerala]]. Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n===Thiyyar Marriage===\n\n[[Edgar Thurston]] has described Thiyyar wedding in his [[Castes and Tribes of Southern India]] as\n\n\"The South Malabar Tiyan bridegroom, dressed as if for a wrestling match, with his cloth tied tight about his loins, carries a sword and shield, and is escorted by two companions similarly equipped, dancing their way along. The Izhuvan does not carry a sword under any circumstances. The chief feature of his wedding ceremony is a singing match. This, called the vatil-tura-pattu, or open the door song, assumes the form of a contest between the parties of the bridegroom and bride. The story of Krishna and his wife Rukmini is supposed to be alluded to. We have seen it all under slightly different colour at Conjeeveram. Krishna asks Rukmini to open the door, and admit him. She refuses, thinking he has been gallivanting with some other lady. He beseeches ; she refuses. He explains, and at length she yields. The song is more or less extem- pore, and each \"side must be ready with an immediate answer. The side which is reduced to the extremity of having no answer is beaten and under ignominy. Marriage is strictly forbidden between two persons belonging to the same illam. The bride and bridegroom must belong to different illams. In fact, the illams are exogamous. The following formula is repeated by the headman of the bride's party. Translated as accurately as possible, it runs thus. \"The tara and changati of both sides having met and consulted ; the astrologer having fixed an auspicious day after examining the star and porutham ; permission having been obtained from the tara, the relations, the illam and kulam, the father, uncle, and the brothers, and from the eight and four (twelve illams) and the six and four (ten kiriyams) ; the conji and adayalam ceremonies and the four tazhus having been performed, let me perform the kanjikudi ceremony for the marriage of ....

These people, and other Muslim converts in the region, are now known as [[Mappilla]]s.<ref name=\"Gough313\" /> A sizeable part of the Ezhava community, especially in central [[Travancore]] and in the [[Western Ghats|High Ranges]], embraced [[Christianity]] during the [[British Raj|British rule]], due to caste-based discrimination.

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an ''[[ashram]]'' from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of ''[[avarna]]'' access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]\u2014an order of armed [[Sikh]]s\u2014came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to Sikhism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of 60,000 acres of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than 1 acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalization and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.
