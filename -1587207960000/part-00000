McGraw-Hill 2003 {{ISBN|0-07-234903-4}}</ref> For those reasons, the basic directional terms can be considered to be those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other ([[invertebrate]]) organisms.\n\nWhile the terms are standardized within specific fields of [[biology]], there are unavoidable, sometimes dramatic, differences between some disciplines. For example, differences in terminology remain a problem that to some extent still separates the [[#Humans|terminology of human anatomy]] from the one that is used in the study of various other zoological categories.\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:1303 Human Neuroaxis.jpg|thumbnail|300px|<center>Because of differences in the way humans and other animals are structured, different terms are used according to the [[neuraxis]] and whether an animal is a [[vertebrate]] or [[invertebrate]].</center>]]\n\nStandardized [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[zoology|zoological]] terms of location have been developed, usually based on [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] words, to enable all biological and medical scientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their component organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive.<ref name=\"Craigie1838\">{{cite book |author=David Craigie |title=Elements of Anatomy, General, Special, and Comparative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lA82AQAAMAAJ |year=1838 |publisher=A. and C. Black}}</ref>\n\nThe [[vertebrate]]s and ''[[Craniata]]'' share a substantial heritage and common structure, so many of the same terms are used for location. To avoid ambiguities this terminology is based on the anatomy of each animal in a standard way.\n\nFor humans, one type of vertebrate, anatomical terms may differ from other forms of vertebrates. One reason is that humans have a different [[neuraxis]] and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs, humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the [[standard anatomical position]]. Thus, what is on \"top\" of a human is the [[head]], whereas the \"top\" of a dog may be its back, and the \"top\" of a [[flounder]] could refer to either its left or its right side.\n\nFor [[invertebrate]]s, standard application of locational terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when the differences in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] are so radical that common concepts are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] and do not refer to common concepts. For example, many species are not even [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]]. In those species, terminology depends on their type of symmetry, if they have any.\n\n===Standard anatomical position===\n{{Main|Standard anatomical position}}\n[[File:Radiate Oral-aboral Axes.JPG|thumbnail|A [[jellyfish]] of the ''[[Chrysaora]]'' species. Like other animals, its [[appendage]]s move, and in this image are not in a standard anatomical position. In anatomical position, the proximodistal axis (labelled) is straight, and the point labelled \"distal end\" neither to the left or the right of the jellyfish's main axis.]]\nBecause [[animal]]s can change orientation with respect to their environment, and because [[appendage]]s like [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and [[tentacle]]s can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its [[standard anatomical position]]. All descriptions are with respect to the organism in its standard anatomical position, even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures.\n\nIn humans, this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward (thumbs out and to the sides). While the universal vertebrate terminology used in veterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms are thought to be [[Status quo bias|too well established to be worth changing]].\n\n=== Combined terms ===\n[[File:Many-banded krait (2).JPG|thumb|<center>Dorsolateral flattening in the anatomy of a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross-section.</center>]]\nMany anatomical terms can be combined, either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body. For example, \"anterolateral\" indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis (such as the bulk of the [[pectoralis major]] muscle). In [[radiology]], an [[X-ray]] image may be said to be \"anteroposterior\", indicating that the beam of X-rays pass from their source to patient's [[anterior]] body wall through the body to exit through [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] body wall.<ref name=dorland>''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers''. 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.</ref>\n\nThere is no definite limit to the contexts in which terms may be modified to qualify each other in such combinations. Generally the modifier term is truncated and an \"o\" or an \"i\" is added in prefixing it to the qualified term. For example, a view of an animal from an aspect at once dorsal and lateral might be called a \"dorsolateral\" view; and the effect of dorsolateral flattening in an organism such as a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross section. Again, in describing the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of an organ or [[Habit (biology)|habitus]] of an animal such as many of the [[Platyhelminthes]], one might speak of it as \"dorsiventrally\" flattened as opposed to bilaterally flattened animals such as [[ocean sunfish]].\n\nWhere desirable three or more terms may be [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] or [[Concatenation|concatenated]], as in \"anteriodorsolateral\". Such terms sometimes used to be hyphenated, but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen. There is however little basis for any strict rule to interfere with choice of convenience in such usage.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dorsolateral |title=dorsolateral |dictionary=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\n===Planes===\n{{Main|Anatomical plane}}\n[[File:Human anatomy planes, labeled.jpg|thumb|right|299px|Anatomical planes in a human]]\n\n* A '''[[transverse plane]]''', also known as a ''cross-section'', divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.\n*A '''longitudinal plane''' is any plane that is perpendicular to the transverse plane.<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=1VhPAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16 Page 16] in: {{cite book|title=Textbook of Radiographic Positioning and Related Anatomy|author=Kenneth L.

For post-[[embryo]]nic humans a [[coronal plane]] is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. \n:* The '''[[sagittal plane]]''' is a plane parallel to the [[sagittal suture]]. All other sagittal planes (referred to as ''parasagittal planes'') are parallel to it.  The plane is a Y-Z plane, perpendicular to the ground. \n* A '''[[radial plane]]''' is any one of the cross sections that run through a cylindrical shaped portion of the body that are coincident with radii that run from a central point.  The midsagittal and midcoronal planes would both be examples of radial planes, but so would all other planes that cross the intersection of these two planes.\n\nA special sagittal plane is the '''median plane''' or '''midsagittal plane''' in the midline of the body, and divides the body into left and right (sinister and dexter) portions.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} This passes through the [[head]], [[spinal cord]], [[navel]], and, in many animals, the [[tail]].{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} The term \"median plane\" can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures, such as a digit.\n\nIn human anatomy:\n* A '''transverse''' (also known as '''horizontal''') plane is an X-Z plane, parallel to the ground, which (in humans) separates the [[#Directions: human anatomy|superior]] from the [[#Directions: human anatomy|inferior]] or, put another way, the head from the feet.\n* A '''coronal''' (also known as '''frontal''') plane is a X-Y plane, [[perpendicular]] to the ground, which (in humans) separates the anterior from the posterior, the front from the back, the ventral from the dorsal.\n\n===Axes===<!--Multiple links redirect to this section-->\n[[File:Anatomical Directions and Axes.JPG|thumb|Anatomical directions and defined axes in a fish]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 35em; float: center; margin-right: 1em;\"\n|+ Defined axes in [[vertebrate zoology]]\n!style=\"width: 40%;\"| Axis\n!

In [[Projectional_radiography#Projectional_radiography_terminology|projectional radiography terminology]], an ''anteroposterior'' (AP) projection is taken with the [[X-ray generator]] anteriorly (such as in the front of a human), and the [[X-ray detector]] posteriorly. In contrast, a ''posteroanterior'' (PA) projection is taken with the [[X-ray generator]] posteriorly.\n\n===Medial and lateral===\n{{Anchor|medial|median|lateral}}\n'''Lateral''' ({{ety|la|lateralis|to the side}}) refers to the sides of an animal, as in \"left lateral\" and \"right lateral\". The term '''medial''' ({{ety|la|medius|middle}}) is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the \"median plane\".<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /> For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head through the navel and going between the legs\u2014 the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be \"right medial\" and \"left medial\".\n\nThe terms \"left\" and \"right\" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives ({{lang-la|dexter}}; \"right\", {{lang-la|sinister}}; \"left\"). However, as left and right sides are [[mirror images]], using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the [[dorsal fin]] of a [[dolphin]] is \"right of\" the left [[pectoral fin]], but is \"left of\" the right [[eye]], but much easier and clearer to say \"the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins\".\n\nTerms derived from '''lateral''' include:\n\n* '''Contralateral''' ({{ety|la|contra|against}}): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., [[Contralateral brain|contralateral side of the forebrain]]. \n* '''Ipsilateral''' ({{ety|la|ipse|same}}): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.\n* '''Bilateral''' ({{ety|la|bis|twice}}): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (removal of testes on both sides of the body's axis) is surgical [[castration]].\n* '''Unilateral''' ({{ety|la|unus|one}}): on one side of the body. For example, unilateral [[paresis]] is [[hemiparesis]].\n\nTerms derived from '''medial''' include:\n\n* '''Inferomedial''' ({{ety|la|inferus|lower}}): lower and in or near the midline. For example, the human nose is inferomedial to the eyes.\n* '''Superomedial''' ({{ety|la|superus|above}}): above and toward the midline. For example, the human nose is superomedial to the mouth. \n\n[[Varus deformity|Varus]] and [[valgus deformity|valgus]] correspond to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector relative to the proximal segment's vector.\n\n===Proximal and distal===\n{{Redirect2|Proximal|distal|the linguistic terms|Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|the dental terms|Glossary of dentistry}}\n{{Anchor|proximal|distal}}\n[[File:Blausen 0019 AnatomicalDirectionalReferences.png|thumb|350px|Anatomical directional reference]]\nThe terms '''proximal''' ({{ety|la|proximus|nearest}}) and '''distal''' ({{ety|la|distare|to stand away from}}) are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body, respectively.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.\n\nThese terms are frequently used when describing [[appendage]]s such as [[fins]], [[tentacle]]s, [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or any structure that extends that can potentially move separately from the main body. Although the direction indicated by \"proximal\" and \"distal\" is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment, a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference. Thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm, but proximal to a wound on the lower arm.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Do Distal and Proximal Mean? |website=The Survival Doctor |url=http://www.thesurvivaldoctor.com/2011/10/04/what-do-distal-and-proximal-mean/ |accessdate=2016-01-07|date=2011-10-05 }}</ref>\n\nThis terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore by extension is also used in chemistry, specifically referring to the atomic loci of molecules from the overall moiety of a given compound.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=S|title=Chemistry, design, and structure-activity relationship of cocaine antagonists.|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=8 March 2000|volume=100|issue=3|pages=925\u20131024|pmid=11749256|doi=10.1021/cr9700538}}</ref>\n\n===Central and peripheral ===\n'''Central''' and '''peripheral''' are terms that are closely related to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between [[Central nervous system|central-]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid [[Residue (chemistry)#Biochemistry|residues]] are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include ''Central and peripheral circadian clocks'',<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-153128|pmc=3710582|title=Central and Peripheral Circadian Clocks in Mammals|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|volume=35|pages=445\u2013462|year=2012|last1=Mohawk|first1=Jennifer A.|last2=Green|first2=Carla B.|last3=Takahashi|first3=Joseph S.}}</ref> and ''central versus peripheral vision''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/9.10.6|title=The contributions of central versus peripheral vision to scene gist recognition|journal=Journal of Vision|volume=9|issue=10|pages=6|year=2009|last1=Larson|first1=A. M.|last2=Loschky|first2=L. C.|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Superficial and deep===\n{{Anchor|superficial|deep}}\nThese two terms relate to the distance of a structure from the surface of an animal.\n\n'''Deep''' ({{ety|ang}}) refers to something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the [[external oblique muscle]] of the abdomen is deep to the skin. \"Deep\" is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from [[Old English]] rather than Latin \u2013 the anglicised Latin term would have been \"profound\" ({{ety|la|profundus|due to depth}}).\n\n'''Superficial''' ({{ety|la|superficies|surface}}) refers to something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in [[skin]] the [[epidermis]] is superficial to the [[subcutis]].\n\n===Dorsal and ventral===\nThese two terms, used in anatomy and [[embryology]], refer to back (''dorsal'') and front or belly (''ventral'') of an organism.\n\nThe '''dorsal''' ({{ety|la|dorsum|back}}) surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc=\"dorsal/ventral axis specification\" (GO:0009950)}}\n\nThe '''ventral''' ({{ety|la|venter|belly}}) surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc=\"dorsal/ventral axis specification\" (GO:0009950)}}\n\nFor example, in a fish the [[pectoral fins]] are dorsal to the [[anal fin]], but ventral to the [[dorsal fin]].\n\n===Cranial and caudal===\n{{Anchor|caudal|cranial|rostral}}\n[[File:Rostralcaudal.svg|thumb|right|<center>In the human skull, the terms ''rostral'' and ''caudal'' are adapted to the curved [[neuraxis]] of [[Hominidae]]]]\n\nSpecific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:\n\n* '''Rostral''' ({{ety|la|rostrum|beak, nose}}), meaning situated toward the oral or nasal region, or in the case of the brain, toward the tip of the frontal lobe.\n* '''Cranial''' ({{ety|el|\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd|skull}}) or '''cephalic''' ({{ety|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae|head}}).<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\"/> \n* '''Caudal''' ({{ety|la|cauda|tail}}) is used to describe how close something is to the trailing end of an organism.\n\nFor example, in [[horse]]s, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.\n\nThese terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine.<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /><ref name=\"Miller 2002\" /><ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" /> In humans, \"cranial\" and \"cephalic\" are used to refer to the skull, with \"cranial\" being used more commonly. The term \"rostral\" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term \"caudal\" is only occasionally used in human anatomy.<ref name=\"Tortora2006\"/>  This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus, the \"rostrocaudal axis\" refers to a C shape (see image).\n\n==Other terms and special cases==\n\n===Anatomical landmarks===\nThe location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different [[anatomical landmark]]s.\n\nStructures may be described as being at the level of a specific [[spinal vertebrae|spinal vertebra]], depending on the section of the [[vertebral column]] the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth [[cervical vertebra]] may be abbreviated as \"C4\", at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra]] \"T4\", and at the level of the third [[lumbar vertebra]] \"L3\". Because the [[sacrum]] and coccyx are fused,  they are not often used to provide location.\n\nReferences may also take origin from  [[superficial anatomy]], made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. For example, structures may be described relative to the [[anterior superior iliac spine]], the [[medial malleolus]] or the [[Medial epicondyle of the humerus|medial epicondyle]].\n\n[[List of anatomical lines|Anatomical lines]], theoretical lines drawn through structures, are also used to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part of the [[cardiac examination|cardiac exam]] in medicine to feel the [[apex beat]] of the [[heart]].\n\n===Mouth and teeth===\n{{Main|Dental terminology}}\nFields such as [[osteology]], [[palaeontology]] and dentistry apply special terms of location to describe the mouth and teeth. This is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw, some different relationships require special terminology as well; for example teeth also can be rotated, and in such contexts terms like \"anterior\" or \"lateral\" become ambiguous.<ref name=\"Folkens2000\">{{cite book|author=Pieter A.

Terms used to describe structures include \"buccal\" ({{ety|la|bucca|cheek}}) and \"palatal\" ({{ety|la}}) referring to structures close to the [[cheek]] and [[hard palate]] respectively.\n\n===Hands and feet===\n[[Image:Hand Directional Axes.JPG|thumb|right|Anatomical terms used to describe a human hand]]\n\nSeveral anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet.\n\nFor improved clarity, the directional term '''palmar''' ({{ety|la|palma|palm of the hand}}) is usually used to describe the front of the hand, and '''dorsal''' is the back of the hand. For example, the top of a [[dog]]'s [[paw]] is its dorsal surface; the underside, either the palmar (on the forelimb) or the plantar (on the hindlimb) surface. The [[palmar fascia]] is palmar to the [[tendon]]s of muscles which flex the fingers, and the [[dorsal venous arch]] is so named because it is on the dorsal side of the foot.\n\n'''Volar''' can also be used to refer to the underside of the [[hand#Areas|palm]] or [[sole (foot)|sole]], which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as ''[[wikt:palmar#Adjective|palmar]]'' and ''[[wikt:plantar#Adjective|plantar]]''. For example, volar pads are those on the underside of hands, fingers, feet, and toes.\n\nThese terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the \"anterior\" or \"posterior\" surface{{snd}} \"anterior\" can be used to describe the [[Hand|palm]] of the hand, and \"posterior\" can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm. This confusion can arise because the forearm can [[pronate]] and [[supinate]].\n\nSimilarly, in the forearm, for clarity, the sides are named after the bones. Structures closer to the [[radius (bone)|radius]] are '''radial''', structures closer to the [[ulna]] are '''ulnar''', and structures relating to both bones are referred to as '''radioulnar'''. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the [[tibia]] (shinbone) are '''tibial''' and structures near the [[fibula]] are '''fibular''' (or '''peroneal''').\n\n===Rotational direction===\nMost terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion ([[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|translation]]) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]] as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes.\n\n'''Anteversion''' and '''retroversion''' are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards (towards the front of the body) or backwards (towards the back of the body) respectively, relative to some datum position. The terms also describe the positioning of surgical implants, such as in [[arthroplasty]].\n\n* '''Anteversion''' refers to an anatomical structure being tilted further ''forward'' than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, there may be a need to measure the anteversion of the neck of a bone such as a femur.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/02841858909177461|title=Evaluation of Three Methods for Measurement of Femoral Neck Anteversion|journal=Acta Radiologica|volume=30|pages=69\u201373|year=1989|last1=H\u00f8iseth|first1=Arne|last2=Reiker\u00e5s|first2=O.|last3=F\u00f8nstelien|first3=E.|doi-access=free}}</ref> For example, a woman's [[uterus]] typically is anteverted, tilted slightly ''forward''. A misaligned [[pelvis]] may be anteverted, that is to say tilted ''forward'' to some relevant degree.\n* '''Retroversion''' is rotation around the same axis as that of anteversion, but in the opposite sense, that is to say, tilting ''back''. A structure so affected is described as being [[retroverted uterus|retroverted]]. As with anteversion, retroversion is a completely general term and can apply to a backward tilting of such hard structures as bones, soft organs such as uteri, or surgical implants.\n\n===Other directional terms===\nSeveral other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:\n* '''Axial''' ({{ety|la|axis|axle}}): around the central axis of the organism or the extremity. Two related terms, \"abaxial\" and \"adaxial\", refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism, respectively\n* '''Parietal''' ({{ety|la|paries|wall}}): pertaining to the wall of a body cavity. For example, the [[parietal peritoneum]] is the lining on the inside of the abdominal cavity. Parietal can also refer specifically to the [[parietal bone]] of the skull or associated structures.\n* '''Posteromedial''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after||medius|middle}}): situated towards the middle of the posterior surface.\n* '''Posterosuperior''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after}} and superior): situated towards the upper part of the posterior surface.\n* '''Terminal''' ({{ety|la|terminus|boundary or end}}) at the extremity of a (usually projecting) structure, as in \"...an antenna with a terminal sensory hair\".\n* '''Visceral''' and ''viscus'' ({{ety|la|viscera|internal organs}}): associated with organs ''within'' the body's cavities. For example, the [[stomach]] is covered with a lining called the visceral [[peritoneum]] as opposed to the parietal peritoneum. Viscus can also be used to mean \"organ\". For example, the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity.\n\n===Prefixes, suffixes, and other modifiers===\nDirectional and locational prefixes can modify many anatomical and morphological terms, sometimes in formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.\n\nPrefixes\n* '''Sub-''' ({{ety|la|sub|preposition beneath, close to, nearly etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, qualifies terms in various senses. Consider ''subcutaneous'' as meaning beneath the skin, ''subterminal'' meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean \"nearly\" or ''\"more-or-less\"''; for instance ''subglobular'' means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to \"hypo-\"\n* '''Hypo-''' ({{ety|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03cc|under}}) Like \"sub\" in various senses as in ''hypolingual nerve'' beneath the tongue, or ''hypodermal'' fat beneath the skin \n* '''Infra-''' ({{ety|la|infra|preposition beneath, below etc}}) Similar to \"sub\"; a direct opposite to ''super-'' and ''supra-'', as in ''[[Infratemporal space]]'' or ''[[wikt:infraorbital|infraorbital]]''. \n* '''Inter-''' ({{ety|la|inter|between}}): between two other structures. For example, the [[navel]] is ''intermediate'' to the left arm and the contralateral (right) leg. The ''[[intercostal muscle]]s run between the ribs.\n* '''Super-'' or ''Supra-''' ({{ety|la|super, supra|above, on top of, beyond etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, as in ''[[superciliary arches]]'' or ''[[wikt:supraorbital|supraorbital]]''\n\nSuffixes\n* '''-ad''' ({{ety|la|ad|towards or up to}})\nCommonly when, for example, one anatomical feature is nearer to something than another, one may use an expression such as \"nearer the distal end\" or \"distal to\". However, an unambiguous and concise convention is to use the Latin suffix ''-ad'', meaning \"towards\", or sometimes \"to\". {{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} So for example, \"''distad''\" means \"in the distal direction\", and \"distad of the femur\" means \"beyond the femur in the distal direction\". The suffix may be used very widely, as in the following examples: anteriad (towards the anterior), apicad (towards the apex), basad (towards the basal end), caudad, centrad, cephalad (towards the cephalic end), craniad, dextrad, dextrocaudad, dextrocephalad, distad, dorsad, ectad (towards the ectal, or exterior, direction), entad (towards the interior), laterad, mediad, mesad, neurad, orad, posteriad, proximad, rostrad, sinistrad, sinistrocaudad, sinistrocephalad, ventrad''.''<ref name= \"GGHDHD\">{{cite book |last=Gordh |first=Gordon |last2=Headrick |first2=David H |title=A Dictionary of Entomology |publisher=CABI |year=2011 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1845935429}}</ref>\n\n==Specific animals and other organisms==\nThe large variety of [[body plan|body shapes]] present in invertebrates presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms. Depending on the organism, some terms are taken by analogy from vertebrate anatomy, and appropriate novel terms are applied as needed. Some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates; for example proximal, literally meaning \"near\" refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body, and distal, literally meaning \"standing away from\" is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment. In all cases, the usage of terms is dependent on the [[body plan]] of the organism.\n\nFor example, especially in organisms without distinct heads for reasons of broader applicability, \"anterior\" is usually preferred.<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /><ref name=\"Miller 2002\">Miller, S.

However, for historical and other reasons, standard human directional terminology has several differences from that used for other bilaterally symmetrical organisms.\n\nThe terms of zootomy and anatomy came into use at a time when all scientific communication took place in Latin. In their original Latin forms the respective meanings of \"anterior\" and \"posterior\" are ''in front of'' (or ''before'') and ''behind'' (or ''after''), those of \"dorsal\" and \"ventral\" are ''toward the spine'' and ''toward the belly'', and those of \"superior\" and \"inferior\" are ''above'' and ''below''.\n\nHumans, however, have the rare property of having an upright torso. This makes their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions the same, and the inferior/superior directions necessary.<ref name= \"Latin Tucker\">{{cite book | author= Tucker, T. G.| title = A Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin | publisher = Max Niemeyer Verlag | location = Halle (Saale)| year = 1931 | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nMost animals, furthermore, are capable of moving relative to their environment. So while \"up\" might refer to the direction of a standing human's head, the same term (\"up\") might be used to refer to the direction of the belly of a [[supine position|supine]] human. It is also necessary to employ some specific anatomical knowledge in order to apply the terminology unambiguously: For example, while the ears would be ''superior'' to (above) the shoulders in a human, this fails when describing the [[armadillo]], where the shoulders are above the ears. Thus, in [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] terminology, the ears would be ''cranial'' to (i.e., \"toward the head from\") the shoulders in the armadillo, the [[dog]], the [[kangaroo]], or any other [[wikt:terrestrial|terrestrial]] vertebrate, including the human. Likewise, while the belly is considered ''anterior'' to (in front of) the back in humans, this terminology fails for the flounder, the armadillo, and the dog. In veterinary terms, the belly would be ''ventral'' (\"toward the abdomen\") in all vertebrates.\n\nWhile it would be possible to introduce a system of axes that is completely consistent between humans and other vertebrates by having two separate pairs of axes, one used exclusively for the head (e.g., anterior/posterior and inferior/superior) and the other exclusively for the torso (e.g., dorsal/ventral and caudal/rostral, or \"toward the tail\"/\"toward the beak\"), doing so would require the renaming of many anatomical structures.\n\n===Asymmetrical and spherical organisms===\n[[Image:Asymmetrical and Spherical.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Asymmetrical and spherical [[body plan|body shapes]]. (a) An organism with an asymmetrical, amoeboid, body plan (''Amoeba proteus''{{snd}} an amoeba). (b) An organism with a spherical body plan (''Actinophrys sol''{{snd}} a [[heliozoan]]).]]\nIn organisms with a changeable shape, such as [[amoeboid]] organisms, most directional terms are meaningless, since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in [[Spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as nothing would distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as ''superficial'' and ''deep'', or sometimes ''proximal'' and ''distal'', are usefully descriptive.\n[[Image:Longitudinal Diatom (Labelled).JPG|thumb|right|Four individuals of ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum'', a [[diatom]] with a fixed elongated shape.]]\n\n===Elongated organisms===\nIn organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other, at least two directional terms can be used. The ''long'' or ''longitudinal axis'' is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism. Similarly, a perpendicular ''transverse axis'' can be defined by points on opposite sides of the organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are [[planktonic]] (free-swimming) [[protists]], and are nearly always viewed on [[microscope slide]]s, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal [[cytostome]] or other unique structure is present.<ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" />\n\n<!-- Apical (anatomy) and Basal (anatomy) redirect here -->\n[[Image:Labelled Ciliates.JPG|thumb|left|Organisms where the ends of the long axis are distinct. (''Paramecium caudatum'', above, and ''[[Stentor roeselii]]'', below.)]]\n\nSome elongated [[protists]] have distinctive ends of the body. In such organisms, the end with a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the [[cytostome]] in ''[[Paramecium]]'' or ''[[Stentor]]''), or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism's [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] (such as the end with the [[flagellum]] in ''[[Euglena]]''), is normally designated as the '''anterior''' end. The opposite end then becomes the '''posterior end'''.<ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" /> Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always [[planktonic]] (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] (normally attached to a surface).<ref>{{cite book |title=On the Origin of Phyla |last=Valentine |first=James W. |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-84548-7 }}</ref>\n[[Image:Venus Flower Basket (sponge-labelled).JPG|thumb|right|A cluster of [[Venus' Flower Basket|''Euplectella aspergillum'' sponges (Venus flower baskets)]], showing the apical-basal axes.]]\n\n{{Anchor|apical}}\nOrganisms that are attached to a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], such as [[Porifera|sponges]], or some [[Protista|animal-like protists]] also have distinctive ends. The part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the '''basal end''' ({{ety|la|basis|support/foundation}}), whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the '''apical end''' ({{ety|la|apex|peak/tip}}).\n\n===Radially symmetrical organisms===\n[[Radial symmetry|Radially symmetrical organisms]] include those in the group [[Radiata]]{{snd}} primarily [[Cnidaria|jellyfish, sea anemones and corals]] and the [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]].<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /><ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" /> Adult [[Echinodermata|echinoderms]], such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s and others are also included, since they are pentaradial, meaning they have five [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|discrete rotational]] [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]].

'''Medial''' can be used, but in the case of radiates indicates the central point, rather than a central axis as in vertebrates. Thus, there are multiple possible '''radial axes''' and '''medio-peripheral''' (half-) '''axes'''. However, some biradially symmetrical [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]] do have distinct \"tentacular\" and \"pharyngeal\" axes<ref>Ruppert ''et al.'' (2004), p. 184.</ref> and are thus anatomically equivalent to [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetrical]] animals.\n\nAs with vertebrates, [[appendage]]s that move independently of the body ([[tentacles]] in [[cnidaria]]ns and [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]]), have a definite ''proximodistal axis'' (Fig. 9).\n\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"110\">\nImage:Radiate Radial Axes.JPG|''Aurelia aurita'', another species of [[jellyfish]], showing multiple radial and medio-peripheral axes\nFile:Porania_pulvillus.jpg|The [[sea star]] ''Porania pulvillus'', aboral and oral surfaces\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Spiders===\n{{See also|Glossary of spider terms|Spider anatomy}}\nTwo specialized terms are useful in describing views of [[arachnid]] legs and [[pedipalp]]s.

Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the [[carapace]] of the [[prosoma]], and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other [[taxon|taxa]]. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one pair of eyes. Some species (mainly [[troglobite]]s) have no functional eyes at all.\n\nIn what is seen as the likeliest ancestral arrangement of the eyes of the Araneae, there are two roughly parallel, horizontal, symmetrical, transverse rows of eyes, each containing two symmetrically placed pairs, respectively called: anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE) and (PLE); and anterior and posterior median eyes (AME) and (PME).\n\nAs a rule it is not difficult to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Palystes superciliosus male anterior 2012 03 04 3452.JPG|Aspects of spider anatomy; This aspect shows the mainly prolateral surface of the anterior femora, plus the typical horizontal eye pattern of the [[Sparassidae]]\nFile:Hogna species female Lycosidae showing eye pattern EOS 027s.jpg|Typical arrangement of eyes in the [[Lycosidae]], with PME being the largest\nFile:Salticidae Male Anterior annotated.jpg|In the [[Salticidae]] the AME are the largest\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geometric terms of location]]\n\n===Anatomy===\n* {{annotated link|Standard anatomical position}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of motion}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of muscle}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of bone}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy}}\nCategories:\n* [[:Category:Glossaries of medicine]]\n* [[:Category:Glossaries of science]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* {{annotated link|Handedness}}\n* {{annotated link|Laterality}}\n* {{annotated link|Proper right and proper left}}\n* {{annotated link|Reflection symmetry}}\n* {{annotated link|Sinistral and dextral}}\n* {{annotated link|Direction (disambiguation)}}\n* {{annotated link|Port and starboard}}, another example of terms of directionality that do not depend on the location of the observer for things that are bilaterally symmetrical\n* [[Clockwise]]\n* [[Cardinal Directions]]\n* [[Blocking (stage)]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last=Wake|editor-first=Marvale H.|title=Hyman's comparative vertebrate anatomy.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226870113|edition=3rd|ref={{harvid|Wake|1992}}|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hymanscomparativ0000hyma}}\n* {{cite web|title=GeneOntology|url=http://amigo.geneontology.org|website=GeneOntology|publisher=The Gene Ontology Consortium|accessdate=26 October 2014\n| ref ={{harvid|GO|2014}} }}\n{{refend}}\n{{anatomy}}\n{{laterality}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anatomical Terms Of Location}}\n[[Category:Anatomy| ]]\n[[Category:Animal anatomy]]\n[[Category:Medical terminology]]\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]\n[[Category:Position]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Standard terms for unambiguous description of relative placement of body parts}}\n{{Anatomical terminology series}}\n\nStandard '''anatomical terms of location''' deal unambiguously with the [[anatomy]] of [[animal]]s, including humans.\n\nAll [[vertebrate]]s (including humans) have the same basic [[body plan]]: they are strictly [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]] in early embryonic stages and largely bilaterally symmetrical in adulthood.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=1}} If they are divided down the middle, in other words, they have mirror-image left and right halves.<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\">Hickman, C.

McGraw-Hill 2003 {{ISBN|0-07-234903-4}}</ref> For those reasons, the basic directional terms can be considered to be those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other ([[invertebrate]]) organisms.\n\nWhile the terms are standardized within specific fields of [[biology]], there are unavoidable, sometimes dramatic, differences between some disciplines. For example, differences in terminology remain a problem that to some extent still separates the [[#Humans|terminology of human anatomy]] from the one that is used in the study of various other zoological categories.\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:1303 Human Neuroaxis.jpg|thumbnail|300px|<center>Because of differences in the way humans and other animals are structured, different terms are used according to the [[neuraxis]] and whether an animal is a [[vertebrate]] or [[invertebrate]].</center>]]\n\nStandardized [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[zoology|zoological]] terms of location have been developed, usually based on [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] words, to enable all biological and medical scientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their component organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive.<ref name=\"Craigie1838\">{{cite book |author=David Craigie |title=Elements of Anatomy, General, Special, and Comparative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lA82AQAAMAAJ |year=1838 |publisher=A. and C. Black}}</ref>\n\nThe [[vertebrate]]s and ''[[Craniata]]'' share a substantial heritage and common structure, so many of the same terms are used for location. To avoid ambiguities this terminology is based on the anatomy of each animal in a standard way.\n\nFor humans, one type of vertebrate, anatomical terms may differ from other forms of vertebrates. One reason is that humans have a different [[neuraxis]] and another is that unlike animals that rest on four limbs, humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the [[standard anatomical position]]. Thus, what is on \"top\" of a human is the [[head]], whereas the \"top\" of a dog may be its back, and the \"top\" of a [[flounder]] could refer to either its left or its right side.\n\nFor [[invertebrate]]s, standard application of locational terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when the differences in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] are so radical that common concepts are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] and do not refer to common concepts. For example, many species are not even [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]]. In those species, terminology depends on their type of symmetry, if they have any.\n\n===Standard anatomical position===\n{{Main|Standard anatomical position}}\n[[File:Radiate Oral-aboral Axes.JPG|thumbnail|A [[jellyfish]] of the ''[[Chrysaora]]'' species. Like other animals, its [[appendage]]s move, and in this image are not in a standard anatomical position. In anatomical position, the proximodistal axis (labelled) is straight, and the point labelled \"distal end\" neither to the left or the right of the jellyfish's main axis.]]\nBecause [[animal]]s can change orientation with respect to their environment, and because [[appendage]]s like [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and [[tentacle]]s can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its [[standard anatomical position]]. All descriptions are with respect to the organism in its standard anatomical position, even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures.\n\nIn humans, this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward (thumbs out and to the sides). While the universal vertebrate terminology used in veterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms are thought to be [[Status quo bias|too well established to be worth changing]].\n\n=== Combined terms ===\n[[File:Many-banded krait (2).JPG|thumb|<center>Dorsolateral flattening in the anatomy of a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross-section.</center>]]\nMany anatomical terms can be combined, either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body. For example, \"anterolateral\" indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis (such as the bulk of the [[pectoralis major]] muscle). In [[radiology]], an [[X-ray]] image may be said to be \"anteroposterior\", indicating that the beam of X-rays pass from their source to patient's [[anterior]] body wall through the body to exit through [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] body wall.<ref name=dorland>''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers''. 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.</ref>\n\nThere is no definite limit to the contexts in which terms may be modified to qualify each other in such combinations. Generally the modifier term is truncated and an \"o\" or an \"i\" is added in prefixing it to the qualified term. For example, a view of an animal from an aspect at once dorsal and lateral might be called a \"dorsolateral\" view; and the effect of dorsolateral flattening in an organism such as a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross section. Again, in describing the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of an organ or [[Habit (biology)|habitus]] of an animal such as many of the [[Platyhelminthes]], one might speak of it as \"dorsiventrally\" flattened as opposed to bilaterally flattened animals such as [[ocean sunfish]].\n\nWhere desirable three or more terms may be [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] or [[Concatenation|concatenated]], as in \"anteriodorsolateral\". Such terms sometimes used to be hyphenated, but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen. There is however little basis for any strict rule to interfere with choice of convenience in such usage.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dorsolateral |title=dorsolateral |dictionary=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\n===Planes===\n{{Main|Anatomical plane}}\n[[File:Human anatomy planes, labeled.jpg|thumb|right|299px|Anatomical planes in a human]]\n\n* A '''[[transverse plane]]''', also known as a ''cross-section'', divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.\n*A '''longitudinal plane''' is any plane that is perpendicular to the transverse plane.<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=1VhPAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16 Page 16] in: {{cite book|title=Textbook of Radiographic Positioning and Related Anatomy|author=Kenneth L.

The midsagittal and midcoronal planes would both be examples of radial planes, but so would all other planes that cross the intersection of these two planes.\n\nA special sagittal plane is the '''median plane''' or '''midsagittal plane''' in the midline of the body, and divides the body into left and right (sinister and dexter) portions.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} This passes through the [[head]], [[spinal cord]], [[navel]], and, in many animals, the [[tail]].{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} The term \"median plane\" can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures, such as a digit.\n\nIn human anatomy:\n* A '''transverse''' (also known as '''horizontal''') plane is an X-Z plane, parallel to the ground, which (in humans) separates the [[#Directions: human anatomy|superior]] from the [[#Directions: human anatomy|inferior]] or, put another way, the head from the feet.\n* A '''coronal''' (also known as '''frontal''') plane is a X-Y plane, [[perpendicular]] to the ground, which (in humans) separates the anterior from the posterior, the front from the back, the ventral from the dorsal.\n\n===Axes===<!--Multiple links redirect to this section-->\n[[File:Anatomical Directions and Axes.JPG|thumb|Anatomical directions and defined axes in a fish]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 35em; float: center; margin-right: 1em;\"\n|+ Defined axes in [[vertebrate zoology]]\n!style=\"width: 40%;\"| Axis\n!

Also, while the \"rostrocaudal\" and anteroposterior directionality are equivalent in a significant portion of the human body, they are different directions in other parts of the body.\n\n<gallery>\nAnatomical axes.jpg|Anatomical axes in [[Orthograde posture|orthograde bipedal]] vertebrates\nLong and short axis.png|[[Spheroid]] or near-spheroid organs such as [[testis|testes]] may be measured by \"long\" and \"short\" axis.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Vascular Ultrasonography|first1=John |last1=Pellerito |first2=Joseph F. |last2=Polak|edition=6th|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4557-3766-6 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=safNmcP3lakC&pg=PA559 559]}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==Main terms==\n\n===Superior and inferior===\n{{Anchor|superior|inferior}}\nIn anatomical terminology '''superior''' ({{ety|la||above}}) is used to refer to what is above something, and '''inferior''' ({{ety|la||below}}) to what is below it.

In [[Projectional_radiography#Projectional_radiography_terminology|projectional radiography terminology]], an ''anteroposterior'' (AP) projection is taken with the [[X-ray generator]] anteriorly (such as in the front of a human), and the [[X-ray detector]] posteriorly. In contrast, a ''posteroanterior'' (PA) projection is taken with the [[X-ray generator]] posteriorly.\n\n===Medial and lateral===\n{{Anchor|medial|median|lateral}}\n'''Lateral''' ({{ety|la|lateralis|to the side}}) refers to the sides of an animal, as in \"left lateral\" and \"right lateral\". The term '''medial''' ({{ety|la|medius|middle}}) is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the \"median plane\".<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /> For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head through the navel and going between the legs\u2014 the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be \"right medial\" and \"left medial\".\n\nThe terms \"left\" and \"right\" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives ({{lang-la|dexter}}; \"right\", {{lang-la|sinister}}; \"left\"). However, as left and right sides are [[mirror images]], using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the [[dorsal fin]] of a [[dolphin]] is \"right of\" the left [[pectoral fin]], but is \"left of\" the right [[eye]], but much easier and clearer to say \"the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins\".\n\nTerms derived from '''lateral''' include:\n\n* '''Contralateral''' ({{ety|la|contra|against}}): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., [[Contralateral brain|contralateral side of the forebrain]]. \n* '''Ipsilateral''' ({{ety|la|ipse|same}}): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.\n* '''Bilateral''' ({{ety|la|bis|twice}}): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (removal of testes on both sides of the body's axis) is surgical [[castration]].\n* '''Unilateral''' ({{ety|la|unus|one}}): on one side of the body. For example, unilateral [[paresis]] is [[hemiparesis]].\n\nTerms derived from '''medial''' include:\n\n* '''Inferomedial''' ({{ety|la|inferus|lower}}): lower and in or near the midline. For example, the human nose is inferomedial to the eyes.\n* '''Superomedial''' ({{ety|la|superus|above}}): above and toward the midline. For example, the human nose is superomedial to the mouth. \n\n[[Varus deformity|Varus]] and [[valgus deformity|valgus]] correspond to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector relative to the proximal segment's vector.\n\n===Proximal and distal===\n{{Redirect2|Proximal|distal|the linguistic terms|Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|the dental terms|Glossary of dentistry}}\n{{Anchor|proximal|distal}}\n[[File:Blausen 0019 AnatomicalDirectionalReferences.png|thumb|350px|Anatomical directional reference]]\nThe terms '''proximal''' ({{ety|la|proximus|nearest}}) and '''distal''' ({{ety|la|distare|to stand away from}}) are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body, respectively.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.\n\nThese terms are frequently used when describing [[appendage]]s such as [[fins]], [[tentacle]]s, [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or any structure that extends that can potentially move separately from the main body. Although the direction indicated by \"proximal\" and \"distal\" is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment, a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference. Thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm, but proximal to a wound on the lower arm.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Do Distal and Proximal Mean? |website=The Survival Doctor |url=http://www.thesurvivaldoctor.com/2011/10/04/what-do-distal-and-proximal-mean/ |accessdate=2016-01-07|date=2011-10-05 }}</ref>\n\nThis terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore by extension is also used in chemistry, specifically referring to the atomic loci of molecules from the overall moiety of a given compound.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=S|title=Chemistry, design, and structure-activity relationship of cocaine antagonists.|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=8 March 2000|volume=100|issue=3|pages=925\u20131024|pmid=11749256|doi=10.1021/cr9700538}}</ref>\n\n===Central and peripheral ===\n'''Central''' and '''peripheral''' are terms that are closely related to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between [[Central nervous system|central-]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid [[Residue (chemistry)#Biochemistry|residues]] are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include ''Central and peripheral circadian clocks'',<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-153128|pmc=3710582|title=Central and Peripheral Circadian Clocks in Mammals|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|volume=35|pages=445\u2013462|year=2012|last1=Mohawk|first1=Jennifer A.|last2=Green|first2=Carla B.|last3=Takahashi|first3=Joseph S.}}</ref> and ''central versus peripheral vision''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/9.10.6|title=The contributions of central versus peripheral vision to scene gist recognition|journal=Journal of Vision|volume=9|issue=10|pages=6|year=2009|last1=Larson|first1=A. M.|last2=Loschky|first2=L. C.|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Superficial and deep===\n{{Anchor|superficial|deep}}\nThese two terms relate to the distance of a structure from the surface of an animal.\n\n'''Deep''' ({{ety|ang}}) refers to something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the [[external oblique muscle]] of the abdomen is deep to the skin. \"Deep\" is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from [[Old English]] rather than Latin \u2013 the anglicised Latin term would have been \"profound\" ({{ety|la|profundus|due to depth}}).\n\n'''Superficial''' ({{ety|la|superficies|surface}}) refers to something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in [[skin]] the [[epidermis]] is superficial to the [[subcutis]].\n\n===Dorsal and ventral===\nThese two terms, used in anatomy and [[embryology]], refer to back (''dorsal'') and front or belly (''ventral'') of an organism.\n\nThe '''dorsal''' ({{ety|la|dorsum|back}}) surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc=\"dorsal/ventral axis specification\" (GO:0009950)}}\n\nThe '''ventral''' ({{ety|la|venter|belly}}) surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc=\"dorsal/ventral axis specification\" (GO:0009950)}}\n\nFor example, in a fish the [[pectoral fins]] are dorsal to the [[anal fin]], but ventral to the [[dorsal fin]].\n\n===Cranial and caudal===\n{{Anchor|caudal|cranial|rostral}}\n[[File:Rostralcaudal.svg|thumb|right|<center>In the human skull, the terms ''rostral'' and ''caudal'' are adapted to the curved [[neuraxis]] of [[Hominidae]]]].\n\nSpecific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:\n\n* '''Rostral''' ({{ety|la|rostrum|beak, nose}}), meaning situated toward the oral or nasal region, or in the case of the brain, toward the tip of the frontal lobe.\n* '''Cranial''' ({{ety|el|\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03bd|skull}}) or '''cephalic''' ({{ety|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae|head}}).<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\"/> \n* '''Caudal''' ({{ety|la|cauda|tail}}) is used to describe how close something is to the trailing end of an organism.\n\nFor example, in [[horse]]s, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.\n\nThese terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine.<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /><ref name=\"Miller 2002\" /><ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" /> In humans, \"cranial\" and \"cephalic\" are used to refer to the skull, with \"cranial\" being used more commonly. The term \"rostral\" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term \"caudal\" is only occasionally used in human anatomy.<ref name=\"Tortora2006\"/>  This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus, the \"rostrocaudal axis\" refers to a C shape (see image).\n\n==Other terms and special cases==\n\n===Anatomical landmarks===\nThe location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different [[anatomical landmark]]s.\n\nStructures may be described as being at the level of a specific [[spinal vertebrae|spinal vertebra]], depending on the section of the [[vertebral column]] the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth [[cervical vertebra]] may be abbreviated as \"C4\", at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra]] \"T4\", and at the level of the third [[lumbar vertebra]] \"L3\". Because the [[sacrum]] and coccyx are fused,  they are not often used to provide location.\n\nReferences may also take origin from  [[superficial anatomy]], made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. For example, structures may be described relative to the [[anterior superior iliac spine]], the [[medial malleolus]] or the [[Medial epicondyle of the humerus|medial epicondyle]].\n\n[[List of anatomical lines|Anatomical lines]], theoretical lines drawn through structures, are also used to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part of the [[cardiac examination|cardiac exam]] in medicine to feel the [[apex beat]] of the [[heart]].\n\n===Mouth and teeth===\n{{Main|Dental terminology}}\nFields such as [[osteology]], [[palaeontology]] and dentistry apply special terms of location to describe the mouth and teeth. This is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw, some different relationships require special terminology as well; for example teeth also can be rotated, and in such contexts terms like \"anterior\" or \"lateral\" become ambiguous.<ref name=\"Folkens2000\">{{cite book|author=Pieter A.

Terms used to describe structures include \"buccal\" ({{ety|la|bucca|cheek}}) and \"palatal\" ({{ety|la}}) referring to structures close to the [[cheek]] and [[hard palate]] respectively.\n\n===Hands and feet===\n[[Image:Hand Directional Axes.JPG|thumb|right|Anatomical terms used to describe a human hand]]\n\nSeveral anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet.\n\nFor improved clarity, the directional term '''palmar''' ({{ety|la|palma|palm of the hand}}) is usually used to describe the front of the hand, and '''dorsal''' is the back of the hand. For example, the top of a [[dog]]'s [[paw]] is its dorsal surface; the underside, either the palmar (on the forelimb) or the plantar (on the hindlimb) surface. The [[palmar fascia]] is palmar to the [[tendon]]s of muscles which flex the fingers, and the [[dorsal venous arch]] is so named because it is on the dorsal side of the foot.\n\n'''Volar''' can also be used to refer to the underside of the [[hand#Areas|palm]] or [[sole (foot)|sole]], which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as ''[[wikt:palmar#Adjective|palmar]]'' and ''[[wikt:plantar#Adjective|plantar]]''. For example, volar pads are those on the underside of hands, fingers, feet, and toes.\n\nThese terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the \"anterior\" or \"posterior\" surface{{snd}} \"anterior\" can be used to describe the [[Hand|palm]] of the hand, and \"posterior\" can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm. This confusion can arise because the forearm can [[pronate]] and [[supinate]].\n\nSimilarly, in the forearm, for clarity, the sides are named after the bones. Structures closer to the [[radius (bone)|radius]] are '''radial''', structures closer to the [[ulna]] are '''ulnar''', and structures relating to both bones are referred to as '''radioulnar'''. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the [[tibia]] (shinbone) are '''tibial''' and structures near the [[fibula]] are '''fibular''' (or '''peroneal''').\n\n===Rotational direction===\nMost terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion ([[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|translation]]) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]] as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes.\n\n'''Anteversion''' and '''retroversion''' are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards (towards the front of the body) or backwards (towards the back of the body) respectively, relative to some datum position. The terms also describe the positioning of surgical implants, such as in [[arthroplasty]].\n\n* '''Anteversion''' refers to an anatomical structure being tilted further ''forward'' than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, there may be a need to measure the anteversion of the neck of a bone such as a femur.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/02841858909177461|title=Evaluation of Three Methods for Measurement of Femoral Neck Anteversion|journal=Acta Radiologica|volume=30|pages=69\u201373|year=1989|last1=H\u00f8iseth|first1=Arne|last2=Reiker\u00e5s|first2=O.|last3=F\u00f8nstelien|first3=E.|doi-access=free}}</ref> For example, a woman's [[uterus]] typically is anteverted, tilted slightly ''forward''. A misaligned [[pelvis]] may be anteverted, that is to say tilted ''forward'' to some relevant degree.\n* '''Retroversion''' is rotation around the same axis as that of anteversion, but in the opposite sense, that is to say, tilting ''back''. A structure so affected is described as being [[retroverted uterus|retroverted]]. As with anteversion, retroversion is a completely general term and can apply to a backward tilting of such hard structures as bones, soft organs such as uteri, or surgical implants.\n\n===Other directional terms===\nSeveral other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:\n* '''Axial''' ({{ety|la|axis|axle}}): around the central axis of the organism or the extremity. Two related terms, \"abaxial\" and \"adaxial\", refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism, respectively\n* '''Parietal''' ({{ety|la|paries|wall}}): pertaining to the wall of a body cavity. For example, the [[parietal peritoneum]] is the lining on the inside of the abdominal cavity. Parietal can also refer specifically to the [[parietal bone]] of the skull or associated structures.\n* '''Posteromedial''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after||medius|middle}}): situated towards the middle of the posterior surface.\n* '''Posterosuperior''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after}} and superior): situated towards the upper part of the posterior surface.\n* '''Terminal''' ({{ety|la|terminus|boundary or end}}) at the extremity of a (usually projecting) structure, as in \"...an antenna with a terminal sensory hair\".\n* '''Visceral''' and ''viscus'' ({{ety|la|viscera|internal organs}}): associated with organs ''within'' the body's cavities. For example, the [[stomach]] is covered with a lining called the visceral [[peritoneum]] as opposed to the parietal peritoneum. Viscus can also be used to mean \"organ\". For example, the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity.\n\n===Prefixes, suffixes, and other modifiers===\nDirectional and locational prefixes can modify many anatomical and morphological terms, sometimes in formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.\n\nPrefixes\n* '''Sub-''' ({{ety|la|sub|preposition beneath, close to, nearly etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, qualifies terms in various senses. Consider ''subcutaneous'' as meaning beneath the skin, ''subterminal'' meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean \"nearly\" or ''\"more-or-less\"''; for instance ''subglobular'' means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to \"hypo-\"\n* '''Hypo-''' ({{ety|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03cc|under}}) Like \"sub\" in various senses as in ''hypolingual nerve'' beneath the tongue, or ''hypodermal'' fat beneath the skin \n* '''Infra-''' ({{ety|la|infra|preposition beneath, below etc}}) Similar to \"sub\"; a direct opposite to ''super-'' and ''supra-'', as in ''[[Infratemporal space]]'' or ''[[wikt:infraorbital|infraorbital]]''. \n* '''Inter-''' ({{ety|la|inter|between}}): between two other structures. For example, the [[navel]] is ''intermediate'' to the left arm and the contralateral (right) leg. The ''[[intercostal muscle]]s run between the ribs.\n* '''Super-'' or ''Supra-''' ({{ety|la|super, supra|above, on top of, beyond etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, as in ''[[superciliary arches]]'' or ''[[wikt:supraorbital|supraorbital]]''\n\nSuffixes\n* '''-ad''' ({{ety|la|ad|towards or up to}})\nCommonly when, for example, one anatomical feature is nearer to something than another, one may use an expression such as \"nearer the distal end\" or \"distal to\". However, an unambiguous and concise convention is to use the Latin suffix ''-ad'', meaning \"towards\", or sometimes \"to\". {{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} So for example, \"''distad''\" means \"in the distal direction\", and \"distad of the femur\" means \"beyond the femur in the distal direction\". The suffix may be used very widely, as in the following examples: anteriad (towards the anterior), apicad (towards the apex), basad (towards the basal end), caudad, centrad, cephalad (towards the cephalic end), craniad, dextrad, dextrocaudad, dextrocephalad, distad, dorsad, ectad (towards the ectal, or exterior, direction), entad (towards the interior), laterad, mediad, mesad, neurad, orad, posteriad, proximad, rostrad, sinistrad, sinistrocaudad, sinistrocephalad, ventrad''.''<ref name= \"GGHDHD\">{{cite book |last=Gordh |first=Gordon |last2=Headrick |first2=David H |title=A Dictionary of Entomology |publisher=CABI |year=2011 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1845935429}}</ref>\n\n==Specific animals and other organisms==\nThe large variety of [[body plan|body shapes]] present in invertebrates presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms. Depending on the organism, some terms are taken by analogy from vertebrate anatomy, and appropriate novel terms are applied as needed. Some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates; for example proximal, literally meaning \"near\" refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body, and distal, literally meaning \"standing away from\" is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment. In all cases, the usage of terms is dependent on the [[body plan]] of the organism.\n\nFor example, especially in organisms without distinct heads for reasons of broader applicability, \"anterior\" is usually preferred.<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /><ref name=\"Miller 2002\">Miller, S.

''Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach''.

However, for historical and other reasons, standard human directional terminology has several differences from that used for other bilaterally symmetrical organisms.\n\nThe terms of zootomy and anatomy came into use at a time when all scientific communication took place in Latin. In their original Latin forms the respective meanings of \"anterior\" and \"posterior\" are ''in front of'' (or ''before'') and ''behind'' (or ''after''), those of \"dorsal\" and \"ventral\" are ''toward the spine'' and ''toward the belly'', and those of \"superior\" and \"inferior\" are ''above'' and ''below''.\n\nHumans, however, have the rare property of having an upright torso. This makes their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions the same, and the inferior/superior directions necessary.<ref name= \"Latin Tucker\">{{cite book | author= Tucker, T. G.| title = A Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin | publisher = Max Niemeyer Verlag | location = Halle (Saale)| year = 1931 | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nMost animals, furthermore, are capable of moving relative to their environment. So while \"up\" might refer to the direction of a standing human's head, the same term (\"up\") might be used to refer to the direction of the belly of a [[supine position|supine]] human. It is also necessary to employ some specific anatomical knowledge in order to apply the terminology unambiguously: For example, while the ears would be ''superior'' to (above) the shoulders in a human, this fails when describing the [[armadillo]], where the shoulders are above the ears. Thus, in [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] terminology, the ears would be ''cranial'' to (i.e., \"toward the head from\") the shoulders in the armadillo, the [[dog]], the [[kangaroo]], or any other [[wikt:terrestrial|terrestrial]] vertebrate, including the human. Likewise, while the belly is considered ''anterior'' to (in front of) the back in humans, this terminology fails for the flounder, the armadillo, and the dog. In veterinary terms, the belly would be ''ventral'' (\"toward the abdomen\") in all vertebrates.\n\nWhile it would be possible to introduce a system of axes that is completely consistent between humans and other vertebrates by having two separate pairs of axes, one used exclusively for the head (e.g., anterior/posterior and inferior/superior) and the other exclusively for the torso (e.g., dorsal/ventral and caudal/rostral, or \"toward the tail\"/\"toward the beak\"), doing so would require the renaming of many anatomical structures.\n\n===Asymmetrical and spherical organisms===\n[[Image:Asymmetrical and Spherical.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Asymmetrical and spherical [[body plan|body shapes]]. (a) An organism with an asymmetrical, amoeboid, body plan (''Amoeba proteus''{{snd}} an amoeba). (b) An organism with a spherical body plan (''Actinophrys sol''{{snd}} a [[heliozoan]]).]]\nIn organisms with a changeable shape, such as [[amoeboid]] organisms, most directional terms are meaningless, since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in [[Spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as nothing would distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as ''superficial'' and ''deep'', or sometimes ''proximal'' and ''distal'', are usefully descriptive.\n[[Image:Longitudinal Diatom (Labelled).JPG|thumb|right|Four individuals of ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum'', a [[diatom]] with a fixed elongated shape.]]\n\n===Elongated organisms===\nIn organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other, at least two directional terms can be used. The ''long'' or ''longitudinal axis'' is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism. Similarly, a perpendicular ''transverse axis'' can be defined by points on opposite sides of the organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are [[planktonic]] (free-swimming) [[protists]], and are nearly always viewed on [[microscope slide]]s, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal [[cytostome]] or other unique structure is present.<ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" />\n\n<!-- Apical (anatomy) and Basal (anatomy) redirect here -->\n[[Image:Labelled Ciliates.JPG|thumb|left|Organisms where the ends of the long axis are distinct. (''Paramecium caudatum'', above, and ''[[Stentor roeselii]]'', below.)]]\n\nSome elongated [[protists]] have distinctive ends of the body. In such organisms, the end with a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the [[cytostome]] in ''[[Paramecium]]'' or ''[[Stentor]]''), or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism's [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] (such as the end with the [[flagellum]] in ''[[Euglena]]''), is normally designated as the '''anterior''' end. The opposite end then becomes the '''posterior end'''.<ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" /> Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always [[planktonic]] (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] (normally attached to a surface).<ref>{{cite book |title=On the Origin of Phyla |last=Valentine |first=James W. |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-84548-7 }}</ref>\n[[Image:Venus Flower Basket (sponge-labelled).JPG|thumb|right|A cluster of [[Venus' Flower Basket|''Euplectella aspergillum'' sponges (Venus flower baskets)]], showing the apical-basal axes.]]\n\n{{Anchor|apical}}\nOrganisms that are attached to a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], such as [[Porifera|sponges]], or some [[Protista|animal-like protists]] also have distinctive ends. The part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the '''basal end''' ({{ety|la|basis|support/foundation}}), whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the '''apical end''' ({{ety|la|apex|peak/tip}}).\n\n===Radially symmetrical organisms===\n[[Radial symmetry|Radially symmetrical organisms]] include those in the group [[Radiata]]{{snd}} primarily [[Cnidaria|jellyfish, sea anemones and corals]] and the [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]].<ref name=\"Hickman et al. 2003\" /><ref name=\"Ruppert et al. 2004\" /> Adult [[Echinodermata|echinoderms]], such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s and others are also included, since they are pentaradial, meaning they have five [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|discrete rotational]] [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]].

'''Medial''' can be used, but in the case of radiates indicates the central point, rather than a central axis as in vertebrates. Thus, there are multiple possible '''radial axes''' and '''medio-peripheral''' (half-) '''axes'''. However, some biradially symmetrical [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]] do have distinct \"tentacular\" and \"pharyngeal\" axes<ref>Ruppert ''et al.'' (2004), p. 184.</ref> and are thus anatomically equivalent to [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetrical]] animals.\n\nAs with vertebrates, [[appendage]]s that move independently of the body ([[tentacles]] in [[cnidaria]]ns and [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]]), have a definite ''proximodistal axis'' (Fig. 9).\n\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"110\">\nImage:Radiate Radial Axes.JPG|''Aurelia aurita'', another species of [[jellyfish]], showing multiple radial and medio-peripheral axes\nFile:Porania_pulvillus.jpg|The [[sea star]] ''Porania pulvillus'', aboral and oral surfaces\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Spiders===\n{{See also|Glossary of spider terms|Spider anatomy}}\nTwo specialized terms are useful in describing views of [[arachnid]] legs and [[pedipalp]]s.

Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the [[carapace]] of the [[prosoma]], and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other [[taxon|taxa]]. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one pair of eyes. Some species (mainly [[troglobite]]s) have no functional eyes at all.\n\nIn what is seen as the likeliest ancestral arrangement of the eyes of the Araneae, there are two roughly parallel, horizontal, symmetrical, transverse rows of eyes, each containing two symmetrically placed pairs, respectively called: anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE) and (PLE); and anterior and posterior median eyes (AME) and (PME).\n\nAs a rule it is not difficult to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Palystes superciliosus male anterior 2012 03 04 3452.JPG|Aspects of spider anatomy; This aspect shows the mainly prolateral surface of the anterior femora, plus the typical horizontal eye pattern of the [[Sparassidae]]\nFile:Hogna species female Lycosidae showing eye pattern EOS 027s.jpg|Typical arrangement of eyes in the [[Lycosidae]], with PME being the largest\nFile:Salticidae Male Anterior annotated.jpg|In the [[Salticidae]] the AME are the largest\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geometric terms of location]]\n\n===Anatomy===\n* {{annotated link|Standard anatomical position}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of motion}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of muscle}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of bone}}\n* {{annotated link|Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy}}\nCategories:\n* [[:Category:Glossaries of medicine]]\n* [[:Category:Glossaries of science]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* {{annotated link|Handedness}}\n* {{annotated link|Laterality}}\n* {{annotated link|Proper right and proper left}}\n* {{annotated link|Reflection symmetry}}\n* {{annotated link|Sinistral and dextral}}\n* {{annotated link|Direction (disambiguation)}}\n* {{annotated link|Port and starboard}}, another example of terms of directionality that do not depend on the location of the observer for things that are bilaterally symmetrical\n* [[Clockwise]]\n* [[Cardinal Directions]]\n* [[Blocking (stage)]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last=Wake|editor-first=Marvale H.|title=Hyman's comparative vertebrate anatomy.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226870113|edition=3rd|ref={{harvid|Wake|1992}}|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hymanscomparativ0000hyma}}\n* {{cite web|title=GeneOntology|url=http://amigo.geneontology.org|website=GeneOntology|publisher=The Gene Ontology Consortium|accessdate=26 October 2014\n| ref ={{harvid|GO|2014}} }}\n{{refend}}\n{{anatomy}}\n{{laterality}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anatomical Terms Of Location}}\n[[Category:Anatomy| ]]\n[[Category:Animal anatomy]]\n[[Category:Medical terminology]]\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]\n[[Category:Position]]\n", "name_user": "Shhhnotsoloud", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCranial and caudal:remove stray character creating white space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location"}

It had 85 members and a chapter name, Atomaton (for \"an atom of an idea and a ton of energy\") that recognized the [[Atomic Age]].\n\nSweet Adelines went international on March 23, 1953 when the first chapter outside the U.S. was chartered in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada.
