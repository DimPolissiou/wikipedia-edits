Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \"gearheads\"<ref>Band bio at www.btorocks.com.</ref> (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\", \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", and \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of [[Randy Bachman]] (lead guitar, lead vocals), [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] (bass guitar, lead vocals), [[Tim Bachman]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Robbie Bachman]] (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured [[Blair Thornton]] (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success.\n\nAfter the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a [[Bachman & Turner|new album]]. In 2010, they played the halftime show at the [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]]. The two stopped touring following Turner's amicable retirement in March 2018.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/randy-bachman-says-bto-bandmate-fred-turner-will-retire-from-touring-1.3838468 |title=Randy Bachman says BTO bandmate Fred Turner will retire from touring |date=March 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2014, the classic ''[[Not Fragile]]'' line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in performing in a tribute version of \"Takin' Care of Business\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history 1971\u20131973===\nAfter leaving [[The Guess Who]] at the height of that band's success, Randy Bachman recalled being labelled \"a lunatic and a loser\" and that \"nobody wanted to work with me\". The exception was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], former Guess Who lead singer who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family.<ref name=Heatley>{{cite web|url= http://www.teamrock.com/features/2014-05-02/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive |title=The Turbulent History of Bachman-Turner Overdrive |last=Heatley|first=Michael |publisher=teamrock.com |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The result was the band [[Brave Belt]], formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy's brother [[Robbie Bachman|Robin \"Robbie\" Bachman]] on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt's self-titled first album, which saw Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, did not sell particularly well. The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of [[Neil Young]]) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist [[Fred Turner (musician)|C. F. (\"Fred\") Turner]] to perform in the band's scheduled gigs.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions\", 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nTurner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of ''Brave Belt II'' in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two ''Brave Belt II'' songs, but left the band shortly after the album's recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, [[Tim Bachman]], was added as a second guitarist because the band had felt their three-piece arrangement was too restrictive.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> ''Brave Belt II'' also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner's influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the ''Brave Belt II'' album. ''Brave Belt II'' had a harder, more guitar-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner's throaty, powerful voice.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\", article at [http://www.allpar.com allpar.com]</ref>\n\nAccording to Randy Bachman's autobiography, the seeds of the BTO sound were sown at a university gig in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], shortly after Allan's departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan's country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from [[Toronto]]. When that didn't materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like \"Proud Mary\", \"Brown Sugar\" and \"All Right Now\", the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, \"We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nAfter [[Reprise Records]] dropped Brave Belt from their label, Randy Bachman emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the ''Brave Belt II'' lineup, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, \"I went to A&M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum \u2013 you name it. A week later, I\u2019d get letters saying \u2018Dear Randy, We pass.\u2019 We\u2019re thinking of calling our greatest hits album ''We Pass'' and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I\u2019ve got all 22 of them.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74>{{cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs178-bachman-turner-overdrive/ |title=Rolling Stone #178: Bachman-Turner Overdrive |website=theuncool.com |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band eventually landed a deal with [[Mercury Records]], one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973, Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of unplayed demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman's name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rod Stewart]] to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them.<ref name=Heatley/> Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:\n\n{{quote|I could hear \"Gimme Your Money Please\" playing in the background, and that was the first song on the tape. Back then, you sent out two  {{Sfrac|7|1|2}}-inch reels of your album, an A-side and a B-side, and that was side one, cut one. He said, \"Randy, this is fabulous. Is the rest of the album like this?\" And I said, \"Yeah, it's all just good ol', dancing rock-and-roll.\" So he said, \"Well, I have a meeting with my A&R people, but as far as I'm concerned, this is great and I want to sign it.\"<ref>Interview track on ''King Biscuit: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive'', King Biscuit Flower Hour Records</ref>}}\n\nAt this point the band's demo tape was still called ''Brave Belt III''. Fach convinced the band that a brand new name was needed; one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (\u00e0 la [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]). While on their way back from a gig in [[Toronto]], the group had spotted a copy of a trucker's magazine called ''Overdrive'' while dining at the Colonial Steak House in [[Windsor, Ontario]], run by Colonial Jim Lambros. After this, Turner wrote \"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\" and the initials \"B.T.O.\" on a [[napkin]]. The rest of the band decided the addition of \"[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\" was the perfect way to describe their music.<ref>\"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Biography\" at [http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ SongResource.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051317/http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBTO released their eponymous [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|first album]] in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as [[Detroit]]<ref name=\"enotesBTO\">Contemporary Musicians/Bachman-Turner Overdrive bio at [http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bachman-turner-overdrive-biography enotes.com]</ref> and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single.  The Turner-penned \"Blue Collar\" reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album's eventual success was very much the result of the band's relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive immediately travelled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.\n\nOne such opportunity occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Recalled Fred Turner, \"We got a call from radio station [[KSHE]] that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren't coming. We had the ''BTO I'' album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states&nbsp;\u2013 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, 'What the hell's happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!' We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn't know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO>Einarson, John. Booklet insert for the ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive 40th Anniversary'' CD.</ref>\n\nBacked by manager Bruce Allen, the band logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. ''BTO I'' would later be certified gold in 1974 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n===Breakthrough and success 1973\u20131976===\nBTO's second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]'', was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the ''RPM'' albums chart). It was originally to be titled \"Adrenaline Rush\". It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\" and \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".  While \"Let It Ride\" was BTO's first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at #23), \"Takin' Care of Business\" would become one of the band's most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of \"Takin' Care of Business\" several years earlier as \"White Collar Worker\" while in [[The Guess Who]], but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO's repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, \"To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.\" Randy had heard DJ Darryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, \"We're takin' care of business on C-Fox radio\", and he decided to insert the lyrics \"takin' care of business\" into the chorus where \"white collar worker\" previously existed.<ref name=\"RBinterview\">Gary James interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com classicbands.com]</ref>\n\nTim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II''. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 ''Rolling Stone'' interview: \"I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74/> Some other accounts state that Tim left because he was getting married and wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> But in a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, \"He was basically asked to leave. He wasn't BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.\"<ref name=\"Markafterdark\">\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive\". Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at [http://www.newyorkwaste.com newyorkwaste.com]</ref>\n\nBTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for ''BTO II'', Tim was replaced by [[Blair Thornton]]. Thornton had been in the [[Vancouver]]-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, ''[[Not Fragile]]'' (a play on the hit album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\"<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Hits |isbn=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref> and [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] favourite \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\". ''Not Fragile'' remains BTO's top-selling non-compilation album, selling eight million copies to date.\n\nWith management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded ''[[Four Wheel Drive (album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' in May 1975, which included the single \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\". Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, \"Hey You\" would become BTO's second No. 1 single on the Canadian ''RPM'' charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada. ''Four Wheel Drive'''s release was followed by a highly successful tour of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by [[Thin Lizzy]], an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy Bachman, \"Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with [[Phil Lynott|Phil]] and the boys for seven or eight months.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nThe band went on to record and release ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]'' in late 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", which featured a guest appearance by [[Little Richard]] who wailed away on his piano. ''Head On'' also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out for #1]]\", which reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single \"[[Down to the Line (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Down to the Line]]\". This song would appear on some of the later compilation CD's, as well as on re-issues of the ''Head On'' album in CD format. ''Head On'' would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976.\n\nThe first BTO compilation album, ''[[Best of B.T.O. (So Far)]]'', was released in 1976 and featured songs from each of the band's first five studio albums. A single\u2014a re-release of \"Gimme Your Money Please\"\u2014was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM & FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.<ref name=\"riaa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org |title=RIAA - Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=riaa.org |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Randy's departure and the new \"BTO\" 1977\u20131979===\n[[File:Bto-1991.jpg|thumb|right|BTO in [[\u00d6rebro]], Sweden, April 1991 <br /> L-R: Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton, Robbie Bachman]]\n''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', BTO's sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signalled the end of BTO's most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the \"sameness\" of the band's songs on the two follow-up albums to ''Not Fragile'', Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO's sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:\n\n{{quote|Since he (Randy) was funding the whole thing, everything went on his and Mercury's timetable. It finally came to a head for ''Freeways'' when Blair, Rob and myself told Randy we were burnt out, didn't like the songs we were writing, didn't like the songs he was writing, and that we wanted to take some time to regroup {{ndash}} especially since all the other bands were taking a year or two between albums, not doing two a year like we were. Randy told us his songs were fine and forced the album. It ended that version of the band.<ref name=Heatley/>}}\n\nYears later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, \"Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that's what a lot of great bands do. And we didn't.\"<ref name=Heatley/> ''Freeways'' only reached #70 on the US pop albums chart and had no charting singles.\n\nRandy Bachman left the group following ''Freeways''. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, \"But it was decided by management it wouldn't work.\" He conceded, \"We also ran out of common interests.\"<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/>\n\nRandy was replaced by bassist [[Jim Clench]], formerly of [[April Wine]]. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as \"BTO\" because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career.<ref name=\"RBinterview\"/> While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to \"BTO\" and the gear logo.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> The re-structured BTO released ''[[Street Action]]'' in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, spawning no hit singles.\n\nThe band also released ''[[Rock n' Roll Nights]]'' in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly [[Prism (band)|Prism]]'s [[Jim Vallance]], who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with [[Bryan Adams]]. But like its predecessor, ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called \"Heartaches\". Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US.<ref>The song was later a hit for [[Anne Murray]], from her ''[[Something to Talk About (album)|Something to Talk About]]'' album (1986).</ref> BTO played this song on [[American Bandstand]] in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called \"[[Jamaica (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Jamaica]]\". Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on ''[[Bryan Adams (album)|Bryan Adams]]''' debut album in 1980 as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} (Adams had likewise contributed one song, \"Wastin' Time\", for BTO for the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' album).\n\nOn November 3, 2010, [[Jim Clench]] died in a [[Montreal]] hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.<ref name=\"thestar\">{{cite news|title=April Wine and BTO former bassist Jim Clench dies|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/886479--jim-clench-bassist-with-april-wine-and-bto-dies-at-61|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=TheStar.com|location=Toronto|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|title=CBC News \u2013 Music \u2013 April Wine, BTO musician Jim Clench dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/11/05/jim-clench-obit.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=CBC.ca|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lives Remembered \u2013 Telegraph \u2013 Jim Clench|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8124442/Lives-Remembered.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|title=The Gazette (Montreal) \u2013 Obituaries|url=http://www.legacy.com/can-montreal/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=146420804|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Legacy.com via MontrealGazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979\u20131991===\n\nBTO completed the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' tour in late 1979, and officially disbanded in early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]'' in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived [[Ironhorse]] in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, ''Ironhorse'' and ''Everything Is Grey'', before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as \"Union\", released one album in 1981 entitled ''On Strike''. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy Bachman.\n\nBTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner, joined by former [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] drummer [[Garry Peterson]] and [[Billy Chapman (musician)|Billy Chapman]], their drum tech, on piano & keyboards. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and [[trademark]] disagreements with Randy and the others:\n\n{{quote|When Randy wanted to get back together again, I said, \"Okay, let's have a publishing company with the band. Let's all write the tunes. We'll all share equally and there won't be any more animosity.\" He said no, so I got up and left. Blair wasn't asked to rejoin because Randy knew that Blair wouldn't take any crap like Timmy would. They went out and started to use the name BTO within a year and the same trademark that Randy sold to us! So Blair and I sued him and we won. They had to pay us royalties.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/>}}\n\nIn Randy's 2000 autobiography, ''Takin' Care of Business'', he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.\n\nThe new album, simply (and confusingly) titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|BTO]]'', was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach's new Compleat label. \"For the Weekend\", a song from this album, was released as a single, along with a companion music video, and dented the US charts at No. 83. It was the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and would also be the last.\n\nIn 1986, they released a live album culled from their 1985 tour called ''[[Live Live Live|Live! Live! Live!]]'' which featured two new tracks, \"Bad News Travels Fast\" and \"Fragile Man\". The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of \"Bad News Travels Fast\" was released on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]''. They were the opening band for the new [[Sammy Hagar]]-fronted [[Van Halen]] on their ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred's voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen's management.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing [[softball]] during the group's downtime on the road.\n\nAfter the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see line-ups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman later became the drummer for Randy Bachman's band and drummed on Randy's 1993 solo album Any Road.\n\nIn 1988, the 1974\u201377 ''Not Fragile'' line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song \"[[Wooly Bully]]\", which is only available on the ''[[American Boyfriends]]'' movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on another project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.\n\n===''Trial by Fire'' era (1991\u20132005)===\nRandy Bachman was replaced by [[Randy Murray]] after his last departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman's 1987\u201388 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. ''[[Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest]]'' was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.\n\nThe sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, \"They said, 'We'll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you're not there.' The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It's like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I'm there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they've got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there's this inference that I'm there and I'm not there, which is a disservice to the fans.\"<ref>Interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com/RandyBachmanInterview.html classicbands.com]</ref> Replied brother Robbie, \"Randy Murray doesn't fill anyone's shoes. He brings his own.\"<ref>BTO bio at [http://www.canadianbands.com/BTO.html canadianbands.com].</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] voted to induct Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the ''Not Fragile'' line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as \"BTO\" without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted (they would eventually be inducted - by astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]] - in 2014).<ref>http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/bachman-turner-overdrive/</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs.<ref>A clip of one song from those recordings, \"Can't Take It with You\", is available along with the interview at [http://www.btorocks.com btorocks.com]</ref> It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the ''Trial by Fire'' CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.\n\n===Hiatus 2005\u20132009===\nSince the last disbandment of the band in 2005, several of their albums have been reissued. The first one to be made available again since the disbandment was ''Freeways'' in 2005, followed by ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II'' in 2006 and ''Four Wheel Drive'' in 2008. ''Brave Belt I'' and ''Brave Belt II'' were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?r=1&EAN=664140644724&ourl=Brave%2DBelt%2DI%2DBrave%2DBelt%2DII%2FBrave%2DBelt |title=Brave Belt I/Brave Belt II, Brave Belt, Music CD - Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rob and Blair have remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob has been rumoured to state he no longer wishes to play in the band and has hung up his drum sticks.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman's shows, the first time they had played on stage together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show \"Randy's Vinyl Tap\", was slated to be the host of a new television show called \"Road to Guitar\", which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.\n\nRandy Murray still plays occasional shows around the Vancouver area. He is the only ''Trial by Fire''\u2013era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.\n\n===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009\u20132018===\n{{further|Bachman & Turner}}\nDue to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009 in their hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nInformation on the 2010 Bachman & Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website ''bachmanandturner.com''. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, \"Rock 'n Roll Is the Only Way Out\". But after hearing the track with Turner's vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.<ref>Bios at [http://www.bachmanandturner.com bachmanandturner.com].</ref><ref>Randy Bachman interview at [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/randy-bachman-0611/ gibson.com]</ref>\n\nOn September 12, 2009, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F.

In November 2010, they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour.

It has 26 songs on two CDs.

As drummer Rob Bachman put it: \"We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and the funky kinds of rock bands like [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]]. Luckily for us, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|Creedence]] had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner's gruff voice. So it was basically this working man's kind of rock-and-roll.\"\n\nA reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO's legacy:\n\n{{quote|Dave Marsh noted that the band peaked with ''Not Fragile'', an album that \"seemed to exhaust Bachman's imagination; everything before and since is simply sluggish.\" The band's entry in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' acknowledges BTO's limitations, while properly assessing their assets: \"However much it might be open to derision as formula cash-register boogie, BTO's rock is at least dexterously played and arranged, with dynamics reminiscent of mid-period [[Led Zeppelin]].\" For a period during the mid-1970s, BTO enjoyed high sales, steady radio play, and sold out arena shows.<ref name=\"enotesBTO\"/>}}\n\nStated John Einarson, author of the biography ''Randy Bachman: Still Takin' Care of Business'', \"If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] derived his [[Richard Bachman]] pen name from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive when he was listening to the band's song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#1.6\n|title=Stephen King FAQ: 'Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?'\n|author=King, Stephen\n|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Saddlesore Galactica]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRandy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'', making a cameo performing the song \"Taking Care of Business\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-campaign-set-visit/|title=20 Things to Know from THE CAMPAIGN Set Visit|last=Wampler|first=Scott|date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" was also the title of a 1990 [[Taking Care of Business (film)|movie]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[World Series]] and finds the [[Filofax]] of businessman [[Charles Grodin]].

Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (eleven in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \"gearheads\"<ref>Band bio at www.btorocks.com.</ref> (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\", \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\", \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", and \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.\n\nThe original lineup consisted of [[Randy Bachman]] (lead guitar, lead vocals), [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] (bass guitar, lead vocals), [[Tim Bachman]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Robbie Bachman]] (drums). This lineup released two albums in 1973. The second and most commercially successful lineup featured [[Blair Thornton]] (lead guitar), in place of Tim Bachman. This lineup released four albums between 1974 and 1977, including two that reached the Top 5 in the U.S. pop charts, as well as the band's only U.S. No. 1 single (\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"). Subsequent lineups enjoyed only moderate success.\n\nAfter the band went into a hiatus in 2005, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner reunited in 2009 to tour and collaborate on a [[Bachman & Turner|new album]]. In 2010, they played the halftime show at the [[Grey Cup]] in [[Edmonton]]. The two stopped touring following Turner's amicable retirement in March 2018.<ref name=\"ctvnews.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/randy-bachman-says-bto-bandmate-fred-turner-will-retire-from-touring-1.3838468 |title=Randy Bachman says BTO bandmate Fred Turner will retire from touring |date=March 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2014, the classic ''[[Not Fragile]]'' line-up reunited for the first time since 1991 to mark Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive's induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and participated in performing in a tribute version of \"Takin' Care of Business\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history 1971\u20131973===\nAfter leaving [[The Guess Who]] at the height of that band's success, Randy Bachman recalled being labelled \"a lunatic and a loser\" and that \"nobody wanted to work with me\". The exception was [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]], former Guess Who lead singer who had left that band four years before Randy. The two agreed to explore a musical project, and Randy then turned to family.<ref name=Heatley>{{cite web|url= http://www.teamrock.com/features/2014-05-02/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive |title=The Turbulent History of Bachman-Turner Overdrive |last=Heatley|first=Michael |publisher=teamrock.com |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> The result was the band [[Brave Belt]], formed in Winnipeg in 1971 with the additions of Randy's brother [[Robbie Bachman|Robin \"Robbie\" Bachman]] on drums, and Gary Bachman acting as band manager. Brave Belt's self-titled first album, which saw Randy playing both lead guitar and bass, did not sell particularly well. The record label still wanted Brave Belt to tour, so Randy (at the suggestion of [[Neil Young]]) hired fellow Winnipeg bassist/vocalist [[Fred Turner (musician)|C. F. (\"Fred\") Turner]] to perform in the band's scheduled gigs.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\">Gormley, Peter. \"BTO (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive) Frequently Asked Questions\", 7/31/97.</ref>\n\nTurner was soon asked to be a full-time member and sing lead for the recording of ''Brave Belt II'' in 1972. Chad Allan appeared as a vocalist on two ''Brave Belt II'' songs, but left the band shortly after the album's recording. During the tour to support this album, another Bachman sibling, [[Tim Bachman]], was added as a second guitarist because the band had felt their three-piece arrangement was too restrictive.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> ''Brave Belt II'' also failed to achieve any notable chart success, and in mid-1972 their supporting tour was cancelled halfway through. But Turner's influence had started to make itself felt, as he composed five songs for the ''Brave Belt II'' album. ''Brave Belt II'' had a harder, more guitar-heavy sound than its predecessor, complemented by Turner's throaty, powerful voice.<ref>\"Driving Music: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\", article at [http://www.allpar.com allpar.com]</ref>\n\nAccording to Randy Bachman's autobiography, the seeds of the BTO sound were sown at a university gig in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], shortly after Allan's departure. A promoter, disheartened with reactions to Allan's country-flavoured songs, which the band was still playing, decided to sack Brave Belt for the Saturday night show and bring in a more rock-oriented replacement from [[Toronto]]. When that didn't materialize, he begged Brave Belt to stay on and play a set of classic rock cover songs. As the band played songs like \"Proud Mary\", \"Brown Sugar\" and \"All Right Now\", the dance floor filled up and, according to Randy, \"We instantly saw the difference between playing sit-down music people could talk over and playing music they would jump out of their seats and dance to.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nAfter [[Reprise Records]] dropped Brave Belt from their label, Randy Bachman emptied his own bank account to finance another set of recordings with the ''Brave Belt II'' lineup, and began to shop around the next album. Said Randy in 1974, \"I went to A&M, Epic, Atlantic, Columbia, Asylum \u2013 you name it. A week later, I\u2019d get letters saying \u2018Dear Randy, We pass.\u2019 We\u2019re thinking of calling our greatest hits album ''We Pass'' and printing all those refusals on the jacket. I\u2019ve got all 22 of them.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74>{{cite web|url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs178-bachman-turner-overdrive/ |title=Rolling Stone #178: Bachman-Turner Overdrive |website=theuncool.com |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe band eventually landed a deal with [[Mercury Records]], one which Randy proclaimed as a pure stroke of luck. In April 1973, Charlie Fach of Mercury Records returned to his office after a trip to France to find a stack of unplayed demo tapes waiting on his desk. Wanting to start completely fresh, he took a trash can and slid all the tapes into it except one which missed the can and fell onto the floor. Fach picked up the tape and noticed Bachman's name on it. He remembered talking to him the previous year and had told Bachman that if he ever put a demo together to send it to him. Coincidentally, Mercury had just lost [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rod Stewart]] to other labels, and Fach was looking for new rock acts to replace them.<ref name=Heatley/> Fach called Bachman, and Randy describes the conversation from there:\n\n{{quote|I could hear \"Gimme Your Money Please\" playing in the background, and that was the first song on the tape. Back then, you sent out two  {{Sfrac|7|1|2}}-inch reels of your album, an A-side and a B-side, and that was side one, cut one. He said, \"Randy, this is fabulous. Is the rest of the album like this?\" And I said, \"Yeah, it's all just good ol', dancing rock-and-roll.\" So he said, \"Well, I have a meeting with my A&R people, but as far as I'm concerned, this is great and I want to sign it.\"<ref>Interview track on ''King Biscuit: Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive'', King Biscuit Flower Hour Records</ref>}}\n\nAt this point the band's demo tape was still called ''Brave Belt III''. Fach convinced the band that a brand new name was needed; one that capitalized on the name recognition of the band members. The band had already mulled over using their surnames (\u00e0 la [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]). While on their way back from a gig in [[Toronto]], the group had spotted a copy of a trucker's magazine called ''Overdrive'' while dining at the Colonial Steak House in [[Windsor, Ontario]], run by Colonial Jim Lambros. After this, Turner wrote \"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive\" and the initials \"B.T.O.\" on a [[napkin]]. The rest of the band decided the addition of \"[[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\" was the perfect way to describe their music.<ref>\"Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Biography\" at [http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ SongResource.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051317/http://www.songresource.com/bachman-turner-overdrive/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nBTO released their eponymous [[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|first album]] in May 1973. The album broke through in the US via border towns such as [[Detroit]]<ref name=\"enotesBTO\">Contemporary Musicians/Bachman-Turner Overdrive bio at [http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bachman-turner-overdrive-biography enotes.com]</ref> and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and stayed on the charts for many weeks despite lacking a hit single.  The Turner-penned \"Blue Collar\" reached No. 21 on the Canadian RPM charts, but stalled at No. 68 on the US charts. The album's eventual success was very much the result of the band's relentless touring. Reportedly, Fach had agreed to put this album on the Mercury label only if the band would promote it with a heavy concert schedule. Wherever the band was getting significant airplay, Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive immediately travelled there, regardless of the tour routing, to build momentum.\n\nOne such opportunity occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Recalled Fred Turner, \"We got a call from radio station [[KSHE]] that was putting on a benefit. They wanted a band to headline that nobody heard of because the headline acts they had booked got bigger offers and weren't coming. We had the ''BTO I'' album out then, so they at least had something to play and make it look like we were big. They started playing our record every hour, every cut off the album, across six states&nbsp;\u2013 150,000 watts. The record company called and said, 'What the hell's happening? We shipped ten thousand records to St. Louis in one week!' We got there and it was an outdoor drive-in theatre, fifteen to twenty thousand people. The region had been saturated with our album. They didn't know we were Canadian, they just knew the songs. It was incredible.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO>Einarson, John. Booklet insert for the ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive 40th Anniversary'' CD.</ref>\n\nBacked by manager Bruce Allen, the band logged over 300 dates in its first year of existence, and it paid off. ''BTO I'' would later be certified gold in 1974 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n===Breakthrough and success 1973\u20131976===\nBTO's second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]'', was released in December 1973 and became an enormous hit in the US (peaking at No. 4 in 1974) and their native Canada (peaking at No. 6 on the ''RPM'' albums chart). It was originally to be titled \"Adrenaline Rush\". It also yielded two of their best-known hit singles, \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\" and \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".  While \"Let It Ride\" was BTO's first Top 40 hit in the U.S. (peaking at #23), \"Takin' Care of Business\" would become one of the band's most enduring anthems. Randy had already written the core of \"Takin' Care of Business\" several years earlier as \"White Collar Worker\" while in [[The Guess Who]], but that band had felt it was not their type of song. It reappeared in BTO's repertoire during the supporting gigs for the first album primarily, as Randy put it, \"To give Fred Turner a chance to rest his voice.\" Randy had heard DJ Darryl Burlingham say the day before a gig, \"We're takin' care of business on C-Fox radio\", and he decided to insert the lyrics \"takin' care of business\" into the chorus where \"white collar worker\" previously existed.<ref name=\"RBinterview\">Gary James interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com classicbands.com]</ref>\n\nTim Bachman left the band in early 1974 shortly after the release of ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II''. Randy Bachman had very strong religious beliefs and established rules to be in BTO. Among them was a rule that drugs, alcohol and premarital sex were prohibited on tour, and Tim is alleged to have broken all of these. It is said that he was given opportunities to change his lifestyle and did, at least temporarily. Said Randy in a 1974 ''Rolling Stone'' interview: \"I know from experience what can ruin a good thing. Drugs made the guys in The Guess Who change. They got sloppy. They ruined themselves and their marriages.\"<ref name=BTO-RS74/> Some other accounts state that Tim left because he was getting married and wanted to study record engineering and concert promotion.<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/> But in a 2002 interview, brother Robbie said, \"He was basically asked to leave. He wasn't BTO caliber [and] it was difficult to rely on him. I guess the band was conflicting with his whole life.\"<ref name=\"Markafterdark\">\"Behind the Four-Wheel Drive\". Mark After Dark interview with Robbie Bachman at [http://www.newyorkwaste.com newyorkwaste.com]</ref>\n\nBTO continued a very busy tour schedule and during the supporting tour for ''BTO II'', Tim was replaced by [[Blair Thornton]]. Thornton had been in the [[Vancouver]]-based band Crosstown Bus, which released one album on MCA records. In September 1974, the first BTO album with the modified line-up, ''[[Not Fragile]]'' (a play on the hit album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' by [[Yes (band)|Yes]]), was released. It became a huge success, reaching No. 1 on both the Canadian and US album charts. It included the No. 1 single \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet]]\"<ref name=\"bill\">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Hits |isbn=0-8230-8285-7|author=Adam White & Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1988}}</ref> and [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] favourite \"[[Roll on Down the Highway]]\". ''Not Fragile'' remains BTO's top-selling non-compilation album, selling eight million copies to date.\n\nWith management pressure to capitalize on their growing success, BTO quickly recorded ''[[Four Wheel Drive (album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' in May 1975, which included the single \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\". Although reaching no higher than No. 21 on the US charts, \"Hey You\" would become BTO's second No. 1 single on the Canadian ''RPM'' charts. Meanwhile, the album charted in the Top Five in both the US and Canada. ''Four Wheel Drive'''s release was followed by a highly successful tour of Europe and the US, wherein BTO was supported by [[Thin Lizzy]], an emerging band also on the Mercury Records label. Said Randy Bachman, \"Lizzy were just opening in England, but our label wanted to bust them in the rest of Europe and break them wide open in the States, so we toured with [[Phil Lynott|Phil]] and the boys for seven or eight months.\"<ref name=Heatley/>\n\nThe band went on to record and release ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]'' in late 1975. This album produced the 1976 Top 40 single \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", which featured a guest appearance by [[Little Richard]] who wailed away on his piano. ''Head On'' also featured the jazzy Randy Bachman composition \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out for #1]]\", which reached #15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. While garnering some airplay on traditional rock stations, it also received fairly heavy rotation on soft rock stations which normally did not play bands like BTO. In between the latter two albums, BTO released their only non-album single \"[[Down to the Line (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Down to the Line]]\". This song would appear on some of the later compilation CD's, as well as on re-issues of the ''Head On'' album in CD format. ''Head On'' would be the last BTO studio album to chart in the US Top 40, peaking at No. 23 in early 1976.\n\nThe first BTO compilation album, ''[[Best of B.T.O. (So Far)]]'', was released in 1976 and featured songs from each of the band's first five studio albums. A single\u2014a re-release of \"Gimme Your Money Please\"\u2014was put out from this album, and it also charted well keeping BTO on both the AM & FM airwaves. Although peaking at only No. 19 on the charts, this compilation album became the best-selling Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album to date, reaching Double Platinum status in the US.<ref name=\"riaa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.org |title=RIAA - Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=riaa.org |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Randy's departure and the new \"BTO\" 1977\u20131979===\n[[File:Bto-1991.jpg|thumb|right|BTO in [[\u00d6rebro]], Sweden, April 1991 <br /> L-R: Randy Bachman, Fred Turner, Blair Thornton, Robbie Bachman]]\n''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', BTO's sixth studio album that was recorded in late 1976 and released in February 1977, signalled the end of BTO's most successful line-up. Facing some criticism for the \"sameness\" of the band's songs on the two follow-up albums to ''Not Fragile'', Randy Bachman wanted to update BTO's sound, including adding horns and strings on some songs, but the rest of the band seemed to disagree. Said Fred Turner:\n\n{{quote|Since he (Randy) was funding the whole thing, everything went on his and Mercury's timetable. It finally came to a head for ''Freeways'' when Blair, Rob and myself told Randy we were burnt out, didn't like the songs we were writing, didn't like the songs he was writing, and that we wanted to take some time to regroup {{ndash}} especially since all the other bands were taking a year or two between albums, not doing two a year like we were. Randy told us his songs were fine and forced the album. It ended that version of the band.<ref name=Heatley/>}}\n\nYears later, Randy seemed to agree with Turner, stating, \"Looking at it now, we should have taken four, five, six months off ... live a little, and then come back together with new ideas. In retrospect, that's what a lot of great bands do. And we didn't.\"<ref name=Heatley/> ''Freeways'' only reached #70 on the US pop albums chart and had no charting singles.\n\nRandy Bachman left the group following ''Freeways''. His initial intention was to temporarily disband while he worked on a solo project, \"But it was decided by management it wouldn't work.\" He conceded, \"We also ran out of common interests.\"<ref name=\"BTO-FAQ\"/>\n\nRandy was replaced by bassist [[Jim Clench]], formerly of [[April Wine]]. Bassist Turner moved to rhythm guitar with Thornton becoming the primary lead guitarist. Clench and Turner shared lead vocal duties. Even though this line-up included drummer Robbie Bachman, the band had to record and tour only as \"BTO\" because of an agreement with Randy who wanted to retain the rights to his surname for his solo career.<ref name=\"RBinterview\"/> While Randy kept the rights to the full Bachman name, the remaining band members bought the rights to \"BTO\" and the gear logo.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> The re-structured BTO released ''[[Street Action]]'' in February 1978. The album became a commercial failure, spawning no hit singles.\n\nThe band also released ''[[Rock n' Roll Nights]]'' in March 1979. It was the first BTO album to prominently feature outside songwriters, particularly [[Prism (band)|Prism]]'s [[Jim Vallance]], who also co-produced the album. Vallance had taken over as main producer after Barry Mraz was fired by the band, and would later score huge success in the 80s with [[Bryan Adams]]. But like its predecessor, ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' also sold poorly (an estimated 350,000 copies worldwide). The album did, however, produce a moderately successful single called \"Heartaches\". Written by Turner, it cracked the Top 40 in Canada and reached number 60 on the US charts, making it the first BTO single in three years to chart in the US.<ref>The song was later a hit for [[Anne Murray]], from her ''[[Something to Talk About (album)|Something to Talk About]]'' album (1986).</ref> BTO played this song on [[American Bandstand]] in February 1979 (with producer Vallance guesting on piano), along with another single from the same album called \"[[Jamaica (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Jamaica]]\". Fred Turner and Jim Clench also appeared on ''[[Bryan Adams (album)|Bryan Adams]]''' debut album in 1980 as session musicians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} (Adams had likewise contributed one song, \"Wastin' Time\", for BTO for the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' album).\n\nOn November 3, 2010, [[Jim Clench]] died in a [[Montreal]] hospital after a battle with stage-four lung cancer.<ref name=\"thestar\">{{cite news|title=April Wine and BTO former bassist Jim Clench dies|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/886479--jim-clench-bassist-with-april-wine-and-bto-dies-at-61|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=TheStar.com|location=Toronto|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|title=CBC News \u2013 Music \u2013 April Wine, BTO musician Jim Clench dies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/11/05/jim-clench-obit.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=CBC.ca|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|title=Lives Remembered \u2013 Telegraph \u2013 Jim Clench|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8124442/Lives-Remembered.html|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|location=London|date=November 10, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|title=The Gazette (Montreal) \u2013 Obituaries|url=http://www.legacy.com/can-montreal/Obituaries.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonId=146420804|accessdate=January 25, 2011|publisher=Legacy.com via MontrealGazette.com}}</ref>\n\n===Disbandment, side projects, and reunions 1979\u20131991===\n\nBTO completed the ''Rock n' Roll Nights'' tour in late 1979, and officially disbanded in early 1980. After Randy recorded the solo album ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]'' in 1978, he went on to form the short-lived [[Ironhorse]] in 1979. Ironhorse released two albums, ''Ironhorse'' and ''Everything Is Grey'', before disbanding. Tom Sparks was the vocalist for the first Ironhorse album, along with Randy, but was replaced by Frank Ludwig for the second album in 1980. Sparks reportedly did not like the constant touring and being away from home for such long amounts of time. A reformed version of Ironhorse, renamed as \"Union\", released one album in 1981 entitled ''On Strike''. Fred Turner was a member of Union along with Randy Bachman.\n\nBTO reunited in 1983. Their line-up for their first studio LP in five years (released in 1984) consisted of Randy and Tim Bachman, Fred Turner, and former [[The Guess Who|Guess Who]] drummer [[Garry Peterson]]. Younger brother Robbie Bachman declined to participate after business and [[trademark]] disagreements with Randy and the others:\n\n{{quote|When Randy wanted to get back together again, I said, \"Okay, let's have a publishing company with the band. Let's all write the tunes. We'll all share equally and there won't be any more animosity.\" He said no, so I got up and left. Blair wasn't asked to rejoin because Randy knew that Blair wouldn't take any crap like Timmy would. They went out and started to use the name BTO within a year and the same trademark that Randy sold to us! So Blair and I sued him and we won. They had to pay us royalties.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/>}}\n\nIn Randy's 2000 autobiography, ''Takin' Care of Business'', he counters that Robbie declined to participate in the reunion when he and Fred refused to share in the publishing royalties of the hit BTO songs Randy and Fred authored.\n\nThe new album, simply (and confusingly) titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|BTO]]'', was released in September 1984 on Charlie Fach's new Compleat label. [[Billy Chapman (musician)|Billy Chapman]], their drum tech, contributed keyboards to their stage shows. \"For the Weekend\", a song from this album, was released as a single, along with a companion music video, and dented the US charts at No. 83. It was the first chart appearance by a BTO song in five years, and would also be the last.\n\nIn 1986, they released a live album culled from their 1985 tour called ''[[Live Live Live|Live! Live! Live!]]'' which featured two new tracks, \"Bad News Travels Fast\" and \"Fragile Man\". The latter was actually a studio recording with the audience sound added to it. A studio version of \"Bad News Travels Fast\" was released on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]''. They were the opening band for the new [[Sammy Hagar]]-fronted [[Van Halen]] on their ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. This plum opening slot was done by a trio line-up of Randy, Tim and Garry Peterson (allegedly with some bass parts and Fred's voice provided via tapes) since Fred Turner had been unavailable when the group was first contacted by Van Halen's management.<ref name=\"Markafterdark\"/> Chapman later stepped in as drummer for Peterson after the latter severely injured his leg while playing [[softball]] during the group's downtime on the road.\n\nAfter the Van Halen tour ended, Randy split and Tim kept going briefly as BTO (see line-ups below). The others reluctantly gave him permission to do so to get his way out of debt. Billy Chapman later became the drummer for Randy Bachman's band and drummed on Randy's 1993 solo album Any Road.\n\nIn 1988, the 1974\u201377 ''Not Fragile'' line-up (Randy, Fred, Blair, Robbie) reformed once again, took to the road and recorded an unknown number of songs together. The only song to make it out into the public by this version of the band was a cover of the song \"[[Wooly Bully]]\", which is only available on the ''[[American Boyfriends]]'' movie soundtrack. But by late 1991, Randy Bachman had left the group again. Two explanations exist for this happening. The first, according to Randy Bachman, was that the band agreed to take a break. But at some point the other members decided they wanted to continue doing concerts because the money was too good to pass up. Randy stated they asked him to tour with them but he was working on another project and had to decline. The others then chose to go on as BTO without him. In the second explanation, the other members (particularly Robbie and Blair) have maintained that Randy quit.\n\n===''Trial by Fire'' era (1991\u20132005)===\nRandy Bachman was replaced by [[Randy Murray]] after his last departure from the band in late 1991. (Murray had been in Tim Bachman's 1987\u201388 touring incarnations of BTO.) This reconstituted version of BTO (Murray with Robbie Bachman, Fred Turner and Blair Thornton) proved to be its most enduring as they toured together from 1991 until December 2004. ''[[Trial by Fire: Greatest and Latest]]'' was released in 1996 and was their last album to contain any new material.\n\nThe sibling rivalry between Robbie and Randy that had started with the 1984 reunion album continued during this era. Said Randy in a 1999 interview, \"They said, 'We'll just call ourselves BTO. People will know you're not there.' The problem is when BTO pulls into town, the radio, the press people, call them Bachman-Turner Overdrive. It's like Coke and Coca-Cola, two names that go hand in hand. It kind of gets represented that I'm there and when they play the gig, I clearly am not there. [And] they've got another guy to take my place who unfortunately is named Randy. So there's this inference that I'm there and I'm not there, which is a disservice to the fans.\"<ref>Interview with Randy Bachman at [http://www.classicbands.com/RandyBachmanInterview.html classicbands.com]</ref> Replied brother Robbie, \"Randy Murray doesn't fill anyone's shoes. He brings his own.\"<ref>BTO bio at [http://www.canadianbands.com/BTO.html canadianbands.com].</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] voted to induct Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive into the museum. However, the band would have had to play as the ''Not Fragile'' line-up, meaning the inclusion of Randy Bachman to the band for that performance. The current version of BTO at the time declined the invitation unless they could be inducted as \"BTO\" without Randy Bachman playing on stage. The Hall refused and the band was not inducted (they would eventually be inducted - by astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]] - in 2014).<ref>http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/inductee/bachman-turner-overdrive/</ref>\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Rob Bachman had stated that BTO was working on nine or ten new songs.<ref>A clip of one song from those recordings, \"Can't Take It with You\", is available along with the interview at [http://www.btorocks.com btorocks.com]</ref> It has been reported from numerous sources that the band could not get a good label to release the project and wanted this album to be distributed and publicized well, unlike what happened to the ''Trial by Fire'' CD. There was also a plan to release a live DVD/CD from a show in 2003 in their hometown of Winnipeg, but thus far this has not happened.\n\n===Hiatus 2005\u20132009===\nSince the last disbandment of the band in 2005, several of their albums have been reissued. The first one to be made available again since the disbandment was ''Freeways'' in 2005, followed by ''Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II'' in 2006 and ''Four Wheel Drive'' in 2008. ''Brave Belt I'' and ''Brave Belt II'' were re-released on a single CD March 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?r=1&EAN=664140644724&ourl=Brave%2DBelt%2DI%2DBrave%2DBelt%2DII%2FBrave%2DBelt |title=Brave Belt I/Brave Belt II, Brave Belt, Music CD - Barnes & Noble |publisher=Music.barnesandnoble.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Rob and Blair have remained very reticent about BTO since late 2004, Rob has been rumoured to state he no longer wishes to play in the band and has hung up his drum sticks.\n\nOn January 23, 2009, Tim Bachman played on stage at one of Randy Bachman's shows, the first time they had played on stage together since 2003. Randy Bachman, who already hosted the successful radio show \"Randy's Vinyl Tap\", was slated to be the host of a new television show called \"Road to Guitar\", which was set to air on the Discovery Channel. He was on tour with Burton Cummings during the summer of 2009, and played dates for the Randy Bachman Band in the United States and Canada for August and September.\n\nRandy Murray still plays occasional shows around the Vancouver area. He is the only ''Trial by Fire''\u2013era member of BTO, besides Fred Turner, to have played shows after the disbandment in January 2005. Like Rob, Murray has also stated he no longer wishes to be in BTO.\n\n===Bachman and Turner reunion 2009\u20132018===\n{{further|Bachman & Turner}}\nDue to the intense interest in a Bachman-Turner reunion, Randy Bachman and Fred Turner announced their reteaming on December 8, 2009 in their hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nInformation on the 2010 Bachman & Turner tour and the new album was provided at their then-new website ''bachmanandturner.com''. As Randy wrote on the site, the project started with his request to Turner that he sing lead on the song, \"Rock 'n Roll Is the Only Way Out\". But after hearing the track with Turner's vocals, Randy asked if his former bandmate could contribute more vocals and some original compositions and offered to put his solo project on hold in favour of a Bachman-Turner album. It morphed into a full-blown collaboration.<ref>Bios at [http://www.bachmanandturner.com bachmanandturner.com].</ref><ref>Randy Bachman interview at [http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/randy-bachman-0611/ gibson.com]</ref>\n\nOn September 12, 2009, the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' had already reported that Randy Bachman and C.F.

In November 2010, they performed at the famous Roseland Ballroom in New York City as part of their North American tour.

As drummer Rob Bachman put it: \"We were basically fans of all kinds of music, but really liked the old kind of rock-and-roll...like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and the funky kinds of rock bands like [[The Rolling Stones|The Stones]]. Luckily for us, [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|Creedence]] had just called it quits, and we came out with three- and four-chord rock-and-roll with Fred Turner's gruff voice. So it was basically this working man's kind of rock-and-roll.\"\n\nA reviewer assesses, however, that critics are divided over BTO's legacy:\n\n{{quote|Dave Marsh noted that the band peaked with ''Not Fragile'', an album that \"seemed to exhaust Bachman's imagination; everything before and since is simply sluggish.\" The band's entry in ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock'' acknowledges BTO's limitations, while properly assessing their assets: \"However much it might be open to derision as formula cash-register boogie, BTO's rock is at least dexterously played and arranged, with dynamics reminiscent of mid-period [[Led Zeppelin]].\" For a period during the mid-1970s, BTO enjoyed high sales, steady radio play, and sold out arena shows.<ref name=\"enotesBTO\"/>}}\n\nStated John Einarson, author of the biography ''Randy Bachman: Still Takin' Care of Business'', \"If The Guess Who made Canadian music North American, Bachman-Turner Overdrive made it international, earning gold and platinum records not only in the US and Canada, but in Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, among others.\"<ref name=Einarson-BTO/>\n\n[[Stephen King]] derived his [[Richard Bachman]] pen name from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive when he was listening to the band's song \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#1.6\n|title=Stephen King FAQ: 'Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?'\n|author=King, Stephen\n|accessdate=December 13, 2006|publisher=StephenKing.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band was featured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Saddlesore Galactica]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09 |title=Saddlesore Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>\n\nRandy Bachman and Fred Turner also appeared in the 2012 comedy movie ''[[The Campaign (film)|The Campaign]]'', making a cameo performing the song \"Taking Care of Business\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-campaign-set-visit/|title=20 Things to Know from THE CAMPAIGN Set Visit|last=Wampler|first=Scott|date=July 25, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" was also the title of a 1990 [[Taking Care of Business (film)|movie]] starring [[Jim Belushi]] as an escaped convict who wins tickets to see the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[World Series]] and finds the [[Filofax]] of businessman [[Charles Grodin]].

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

Changes on the Mk III, the final version of the series which was introduced in June 1965, included a minor reduction in overall length, deeper windscreen, equal size headlamps without chrome bezels, improved interior ventilation, wood-veneer dashboard, the addition of overriders to the bumpers, and a dual-circuit braking system. 104/2308, the blue car illustrated in this article is a mildly modified Mark Two which left the factory in May, 1965.\n\nThe factory made two convertibles: a [[cabriolet]], and a [[Sedanca de Ville|Sedanca]] that opened only above the front seats. The 1963 Sedanca was featured in an article by [[Paul Walton]] in the June 2008 issue of ''Ruoteclassiche'', Italy's leading classic car magazine.\n\nThe front of the C-V8 was styled with covered headlamps, similar to those on the [[Ferrari 275|Ferrari 275 GTB]] and [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar 3.8 E-type]] as a key element of the design. But because of concerns that they might reduce the effectiveness of the headlamps, the covers were deleted for the production cars. As a consequence the C-V8's front-end appearance was compromised and proved controversial for decades. Owners are now starting to return their cars to the original streamlined styling intended by the car's designer Eric Neale. The model was discontinued in 1966 after a total production run of 500. The fibreglass body, and the fact that the twin-tube frame was set in from the perimeter of the car, have contributed to the model's comparatively high survival rate.\n\nThe C-V8 was little used in motor sports although a factory Jensen used the services of a team of racing drivers, including Roy Salvadori to take the Commanders Cup 4-hour endurance events at Snetterton race course in MKIII C-V8 in 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.richardcalver.com/article_cv8.htm|website=www.richardcalver.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref> More recently a Jensen C-V8 has been one of the most awarded cars in Tarmac Rallying, with over 120 trophies including multiple wins and podiums in Targa Tasmania, Classic Adelaide and Targa High Country (Outright and Handicap) and several championship series wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://targa.com.au/tc/news_details.asp?asset_id=29915|title=Targa Car For Sale - Targa Australia|website=targa.com.au|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nOne prototype C-V8 FF was fitted with four-wheel drive and an anti-lock braking system.

Changes on the Mk III, the final version of the series which was introduced in June 1965, included a minor reduction in overall length, deeper windscreen, equal size headlamps without chrome bezels, improved interior ventilation, wood-veneer dashboard, the addition of overriders to the bumpers, and a dual-circuit braking system. 104/2308, the blue car illustrated in this article is a mildly modified Mark Two which left the factory in May, 1965.\n\nThe factory made two convertibles: a [[cabriolet]], and a [[Sedanca de Ville|Sedanca]] that opened only above the front seats. The 1963 Sedanca was featured in an article by [[Paul Walton]] in the June 2008 issue of ''Ruoteclassiche'', Italy's leading classic car magazine.\n\nThe front of the C-V8 was styled with covered headlamps, similar to those on the [[Ferrari 275|Ferrari 275 GTB]] and [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar 3.8 E-type]] as a key element of the design. But because of concerns that they might reduce the effectiveness of the headlamps, the covers were deleted for the production cars. As a consequence the C-V8's front-end appearance was compromised and proved controversial for decades. Owners are now starting to return their cars to the original streamlined styling intended by the car's designer Eric Neale. The model was discontinued in 1966 after a total production run of 500. The fibreglass body, and the fact that the twin-tube frame was set in from the perimeter of the car, have contributed to the model's comparatively high survival rate.\n\nThe C-V8 was little used in motor sports although a factory Jensen used the services of a team of racing drivers, including Roy Salvadori to take the Commanders Cup 4-hour endurance events at Snetterton race course in MKIII C-V8 in 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.richardcalver.com/article_cv8.htm|website=www.richardcalver.com|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref> More recently a Jensen C-V8 has been one of the most awarded cars in Tarmac Rallying, with over 120 trophies including multiple wins and podiums in Targa Tasmania, Classic Adelaide and Targa High Country (Outright and Handicap) and several championship series wins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://targa.com.au/tc/news_details.asp?asset_id=29915|title=Targa Car For Sale - Targa Australia|website=targa.com.au|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\nOne prototype C-V8 FF was fitted with four-wheel drive and an anti-lock braking system.

He is most famous for being the first to attempt the [[standardisation]] of the [[Basque language]] and for the translation of religious works into Basque, in particular the first Basque translation of the [[New Testament]].\n\nFrench spellings of his name are often encountered in older works, for example ''Ioannes Lei\u00e7arraga'' and ''Jean de Li\u00e7arrague'' and various other  spellings of his surname such as ''Leissarrague'' or ''Lei\u00e7arraga''. or in Spanish '''Juan de Liz\u00e1rraga'''.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Briscous-mairie-004.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Leizarraga in [[Briscous|Beskoitze (Briscous)]] near Bayonne]]\n[[File:Leizarraga biblia 01.png|thumb|Cover of the New Testament's translation, ''IESVS CHIST GVRE IAVNAREN TESTAMENTV BERRIA'' (1571)]]\n\n===Early years===\nLeizarraga was born in the [[Northern Basque Country]] in the province of [[Labourd]] in a village called [[Briscous]] in 1506. Although the village was in Labourd, it fell within the area of the [[Lower Navarrese]] dialect of Basque. His family's farmhouse bore the family's name, Leizarraga, and stood in Briscous until it was destroyed in 1944. Very little is known about Leizarraga's early years beyond these few facts.\n\n===Priesthood===\nLeizarraga was baptised a [[Catholic]]. Although it is not known where he trained, he was trained as a priest and converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1560.

He is most famous for being the first to attempt the [[standardisation]] of the [[Basque language]] and for the translation of religious works into Basque, in particular the first Basque translation of the [[New Testament]].\n\nFrench spellings of his name are often encountered in older works, for example ''Ioannes Lei\u00e7arraga'' and ''Jean de Li\u00e7arrague'' and various other  spellings of his surname such as ''Leissarrague'' or ''Lei\u00e7arraga''. or in Spanish '''Juan de Liz\u00e1rraga'''.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Briscous-mairie-004.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Leizarraga in [[Briscous|Beskoitze (Briscous)]] near Bayonne]]\n[[File:Leizarraga biblia 01.png|thumb|Cover of the New Testament's translation, ''IESVS CHIST GVRE IAVNAREN TESTAMENTV BERRIA'' (1571)]]\n\n===Early years===\nLeizarraga was born in the [[Northern Basque Country]] in the province of [[Labourd]] in a village called [[Briscous]] in 1506. Although the village was in Labourd, it fell within the area of the [[Lower Navarrese]] dialect of Basque. His family's farmhouse bore the family's name, Leizarraga, and stood in Briscous until it was destroyed in 1944. Very little is known about Leizarraga's early years beyond these few facts.\n\n===Priesthood===\nLeizarraga was baptised a [[Catholic]]. Although it is not known where he trained, he was trained as a priest and converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1560. By 1563, his name is mentioned in the records of the Protestant Synod of [[B\u00e9arn]].\n\nIn his dedication of the New Testament to [[Jeanne d'Albret]] he mentions having spent time in prison but again, it is not known which prison he was in, what the charge was or how long he was imprisoned for.\n\nHe was instituted as [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church in [[La Bastide-Clairence|Bastide]] in [[Lower Navarre]] in 1567 by Jeanne d'Albret. By the time Leizarraga came to Bastide, the majority of inhabitants were not speaking Basque but [[Gascon language|Gascon]], since it had come to be populated by a Gascon colony. Nonetheless, Leizarraga was even in his time renowned as a great scholar of the Basque language, the very reason he would later be entrusted with the translation of the New Testament. It is also known that various Basque shepherds in the area sent their children to him so that he would teach them Basque.\n\nHe was married but it is not known when or to whom.\n\nIn March 1563 Leizarraga was instructed by [[Jeanne d'Albret]], the Queen of [[Navarre]] at the Synod of B\u00e9arn to produce a Basque translation of the New Testament. Having negotiated the tricky issue of translating into a language which by then had no great written tradition, common standard or spelling system, he persevered with some help from four old Catholic colleagues: Piarres Landetxeberri from [[Esp\u00e8s-Undurein]], Sanz de Tartas from [[Charritte-de-Bas]] (both in [[Soule]]), Joanes Etxeberri from [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and a Mr Tardets who was a minister in [[Ostabat]]. Finally, in 1571, the printer Pierre Hautin based in [[La Rochelle]] printed three works by Leizarraga, amongst them is translation of the New Testament.\n\nIt is indicative of the respect he commanded that in 1582 he was visited by [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], the man who would later negotiate the [[Edict of Nantes]] on religious tolerance.

''[[OED]]:'' \"Sisal\".</ref> {{IPA-es|si\u02c8sal|lang}}), with the botanical name '''''Agave sisalana''''', is a species of ''[[Agave]]'' native to southern Mexico but widely cultivated and naturalized in many other countries. It yields a stiff [[fiber|fibre]] used in making various products. The term sisal may refer either to the plant's common name or the fibre, depending on the context. It is sometimes referred to as \"sisal hemp\", because for centuries [[hemp]] was a major source for fibre, and other fibre sources were named after it.\n\nThe sisal fibre is traditionally used for [[rope]] and [[twine]], and has many other uses, including [[paper]], [[cloth]], [[footwear]], [[hats]], [[bag]]s, [[carpet]]s, [[geotextile]]s, and [[dartboard]]s. They are also being used as fibre reinforcements for composite fibre-glass, rubber and cement products.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[native plant|native]] origin of ''Agave sisalana'' is uncertain. Traditionally it was deemed to be a native of the [[Yucatan Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], but there are no records of botanical collections from there. They were originally shipped from the Spanish colonial port of [[Sisal, Yucat\u00e1n|Sisal]] in [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] (thus the name). The Yucat\u00e1n [[plantation]]s now cultivate [[Agave fourcroydes|henequen (''Agave fourcroydes'')]].\n\n[[Howard Scott Gentry|H.S.

In some countries, it is a [[first professional degree]] and a prerequisite for [[licensing]] to practice the profession of [[pharmacy]] or to become a clinical pharmacist. In many countries they are allowed to practice independently and can prescribe drugs directly to patients. A Pharm.D program has significant experiential or clinical education components in introductory and advanced levels for the safe and effective use of drugs. Experiential education prepares graduates to be practice-ready, as they already have spent a significant amount of time training in areas of direct patient care and research.

It is a professional degree after earning a B.sc in pharmaceutical science. The duration of the program consists of two calendar years. The first year consists of many didactic,pharmacotherapy, pharmacokinetics, pharmaceutical care of many diseases. The second year consists of rotations or clinical cherkship in different specialties including ambulatory care, oncology,cardiology,nephrology,pediatrics ...etc. .from the universities that offer this degree, faculty of pharmacy Cairo University, faculty of pharmacy Ain Shams University, faculty of pharmacy Alexandria University, faculty of pharmacy Beni suef University.this degree is for practicing pharmacists who graduated from pharmacy schools with bachelor's of pharmacy to be more clinically oriented As of 2019 things has changed, the B.sc (5 years program) has been replaced with pharma D degree (6 years program) as the first qualification obtained which qualifies the student to legally practice pharmacy in Egypt.\n\n=== Ghana ===\n\nPharm.D is a 6-year course offered in Ghana from the academic year 2012/2013, initially by the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). It leads to the award of the Doctor of Pharmacy certificate making one eligible to qualify, register and operate as a licensed pharmacist. An aggregate of 06 in the WASSCE results is currently the acceptable cutoff point. Also, a year Top-up program was rolled out in the 2017/18 academic year for practicing pharmacists with the Bpharm qualification to obtain the Pharm.D qualification which will soon become the minimum degree for licensure. The University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS)-Volta Region (2016/17 academic year), The University of Ghana-Legon, Entrance University College of Health Sciences-Spintex and Central University College-Miotso (in 2018/19 academic year), have also rolled out the Pharm.D program.\n\nThe first graduating group of the Pharm.D course in Ghana graduated in 2018. Much is expected of them to change the practice of pharmacy in Ghana to be more patient-centered than drug-centered and they are anticipated in various hospitals all over the country.\n\n=== Morocco ===\n\nPharm.D. is a program offered at the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Rabat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medramo.ac.ma|title=medramo|work=medramo.ac.ma}}</ref> and the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmpc.ac.ma|title=Accueil|work=fmpc.ac.ma}}</ref>In Morocco, Pharm.D studies can only be accessed through a competitive examination (\"[[competitive exam|concours]]\", with [[numerus clausus]]) happening at the start of the first year of health studies. All candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools ([[secondary education in france|lyc\u00e9e]]). About a 100 students are accepted every year. In order to obtain the state diploma of \"Doctor of Pharmacy\", studies last a minimum of six years, or 11 years for students choosing [[Residency (pharmacy)|residency]] ([[clinical pharmacy|hospital/clinical pharmacy]], [[pharmaceutical industry]] or [[clinical pathology|medical biology]]). It is accessible through another two competitive exams, even more selective. The first (''Internat'') is accessible in the start of the sixth year, it grants residency after two years of [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and after the student defends their thesis. The second (''R\u00e9sidanat'') is accessible after obtaining the doctorate. [[Residency (pharmacy)|Residency]] lasts four years and gives another diploma of specialist like in medicine (DES for \"dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es\" ).\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n\nPresently, there are only three universities in Nigeria offering the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD.) program. These are the University of Benin, Benin City, Bayero University, Kano and University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The University of Benin commenced the program in 2001 following the approval given for the commencement of the program by the regulatory government agency for pharmacy education and practice in the country, Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN). It was however not until 2016 that the overall regulatory government agency for all university degree programs in the country, National Universities Commission (NUC), formally approved the PharmD degree program. The University of Benin PharmD program is a six-year undergraduate program. On successful completion of the program, students are awarded both the Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degree and the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree. Prior to the commencement of the program, the university offered a five-year BPharm degree program which commenced in 1970. In the PharmD program, students are given extensive didactic preclinical/professional clinical preparation as well as clinical training (including pharmaceutical care) in different hospitals and community pharmacies. Students are prepared to have knowledge on patients counselling,Drug information, pharmaceutical care, ADR reporting, pharmacovigilance and much more. Pharmacy council of Nigeria and the national professional body of pharmacists, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), have envisaged that in the near future, PharmD degree will become the minimum educational qualification for the registration/licensing of fresh graduates of Nigeria's pharmacy schools for practice in the country. Through the efforts of the PCN, most pharmacy schools in Nigeria are now intensifying their preparations to commence the PharmD degree program.\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nSince 2006, Pharm.D is a post-graduate course being offered by [[Rhodes University]].<ref>[http://www.ru.ac.za/applying/postgraduates/mastersanddoctors/mastersanddoctorsforms/ Rhodes University Masters and Doctoral courses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226041624/http://www.ru.ac.za/applying/postgraduates/mastersanddoctors/mastersanddoctorsforms/ |date=26 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tunisia ===\n\nThe Pharm.D program has been available in Tunisia since 1975.\n\nThere is only one faculty in Tunisia that provides education for PharmD ; Faculty of pharmacy of Monastir.\n\nIt is a diverse program focusing on pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry and biology along with marketing and management.\nIt can have two minors : biological pharmacy and industrial pharmacy.\n\n==Asia==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n\nAt present a five-year professional degree is offered in various public universities in Bangladesh. Previously, it was a four-year degree (Graduation) and a one-year degree (Post-Graduation) in Pharmacy is offered in numerous universities of Bangladesh. The study material is taught in English. The textbooks, exams as well as thesis are also provided in English. The universities are the [[University of Dhaka]] since 1964, [[Jahangirnagar University]] since 1982, University of Chittagong, [[Rajshahi University]], [[Khulna University]], [[Jagannath University]], [[Pabna University of Science & Technology]], Jessore University of Science & Technology and [[Noakhali Science & Technology University]]. All of these are government universities. There are also 20 private universities in Bangladesh offering pharmacy education. Among them [[BGC Trust University Bangladesh]] (BGCTUB), [[Southeast University]] (SEU), [[East West University]], [[Northern University Bangladesh]] since 2003, [[Daffodil International University]] , University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC), Stamford University Bangladesh (SUB), Manarat International University (MIU), The University of Asia Pacific, [[International Islamic University Chittagong]], [[North South University]], ASA University Bangladesh (ASAUB), City University (CU) and University of Development Alternative (UODA) are the top rated private universities. It is the best for home and abroad students. The B.Pharm is completed in 4 years and the M.Pharm in one year. Pharmacy Council of Bangladesh (PCB) is the Professional Regulatory Authority for Pharmacists in Bangladesh.\n\n===India===\n{{distinguish|DPharm}}\nPharm.D course introduced by the [[Government of India]] and [[Pharmacy Council of India]] in 2008. The Pharm.D program is a pre-PhD, post-graduate [[professional doctorate]] of 6 years. It was introduced to improve clinical pharmacy services in India and it is the only pharmacy service which is in direct contact with patient health care system. The first batch of Pharm.D post baccalaureate students graduated in August 2011 and 1st regular batch graduated in June 2014. The Pharm.D degree requires five years of classroom and hospital based didactic study (two years didactic post-baccalaureate course), followed by one year of internship training in hospitals in addition to ongoing practicals and research project.<ref name=\"PCIndiaRegs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pci.nic.in/PDF-Files/PharmD-Revised-A.pdf |author=Pharmacy Council of India |publisher=Gazette of India, No.19, Part 3, Section 4 |title=Pharm.D Regulations 2008 |date=2008-05-10 |accessdate=2011-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216020512/http://www.pci.nic.in/PDF-Files/PharmD-Revised-A.pdf |archive-date=16 December 2011 |url-status=dead |author-link=Pharmacy Council of India }}</ref> With reference to Clarification on Pharm.D qualification,<ref>Ref.

Pharm.D is approved by PCI only and MCI do not recognize this course in India. After the Amendment in August 2019,It is compulsory for hospitals to develop DIC(drug information centre).This DIC will be headed by  a Pharm.D Holder.\nAnother Cadre is created known as Clinical Pharmacist.\nThe only and minimum required Educational qualification for this cadre is Pharm.D\nThe Clinical Pharmacist must also assist the physician and medical representative to promote the wellness and correct use of medications\n\n===Nepal===\n\nNepal started three years post baccalaureate Pharm.D in 2010 in Department of Pharmacy, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel, Kavre. It is the first batch in Nepal pursuing the degree. The first batch is now currently involved in a 1 years internship at different well established teaching hospitals of Nepal. The students are enrolled in Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, College of Medical Sciences Bharatpur and KIST medical College, Lalitpur for their internship of 1 year. Kathmandu University has already enrolled the next two batches for further continuation of the Pharm D program.\n\n===Pakistan===\n\n[[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] (PCP) is the professional regulatory authority for [[Pharmacists]] in Pakistan.<ref name=\"Pharmacy Council of Pakistan\">{{cite web|title=Pharmacy Council of Pakistan|url=http://www.pharmacycouncil.org.pk/index.php|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> Earlier (before 2003), pharmacy degree was a 4-year undergraduate B.Pharmacy ([[Bachelor of Pharmacy]]) that focused mainly on drug manufacturing and pharmaceutics but later in 2004, [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] and [[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] collaboratively changed the syllabus and upgraded the B.Pharmacy degree to Pharm.D. Pharm.D (Doctor of Pharmacy) is a 5-year [[professional degree]] in Pakistan. Admission requirements for Pharm.D is 12-years of schooling or HSSC (Higher Secondary School Certificate) in pre-medical subjects (Biology, Chemistry and Physics etc.) or A-levels in similar subjects. Passing an aptitude test is mandatory for getting admission into Pharm.D program. As compared to B.Pharm, Pharm.D is a more clinical and research oriented program. Some pharmacy institutes have collaboration with hospitals for providing clinical clerkship during 4th & 5th Professional year. In 2006, first batch completed Pharm.D program.\n\n===Philippines===\n\n[[Centro Escolar University Makati]] offers the degree Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). The degree requires the completion of 52 units of formal course work and 36 units of clinical rotation done at the Makati Medical Center and The Medical City. It is a 2-year first postbaccalaureate degree open to licensed pharmacists in the Philippines.\n\n=== Taiwan ===\n\nIn [[Taiwan]], Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) program was first introduced in [[National Taiwan University]] since Fall 2009.\n\nPharm. D. program in Taiwan is a six-year academic program, while Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BSc. Pharm.) is a four-year or five-year program. Students taking either Pharm. D. or BSc. Pharm. program are all eligible to take the pharmacist licensure exam.\nThe universities offering Pharm.

The Pharm.D. Program (Pharmaceutical care or Industrial Pharmacy) is a six-year academic program.\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Belgium ===\n\nThe education of pharmacists in Belgium requires a minimum of five years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and two master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. Belgium considers the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy to be comparable to the Pharm.D. title used in the United States. To become a hospital pharmacist, a three-year residency program has to be completed after obtaining the M.Sc. in pharmaceutical sciences.\n\n=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===\n\nIn both countries, the PharmDr. (Pharmaciae doctor) diploma can be obtained by pharmacists who have previously graduated in pharmacy ([[Magister (degree)|Magister]], Mgr.) (the undergraduate study of pharmacy takes five years). Applicants must defend a research or experimental thesis, and pass a rigorous examination. The PharmDr. title is highly prestigious and written in front of the name. It is different from the postgraduate [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree.\n\n=== France ===\n\nIn [[France]], Pharm.D studies can only be accessed through a competitive examination (\"[[Competitive examination|concours]]\", with ''[[numerus clausus]]'') happening at the end of the first year of health studies. Most candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools ([[lyc\u00e9e]]). In case of failure, it is possible to retry once. Yearly success rate depends on the university's current ''[[numerus clausus]]'' and the number or registered students, ranging from 10 to 30% bearing in mind that second-time participants are three to four times more likely to succeed than students trying for the first time.\n\nIn order to obtain the state diploma of \"Doctor of Pharmacy\", the studies last a minimum of six years, or nine years for students choosing residency ([[hospital pharmacy]] or [[Clinical Pathology|medical biology]]). It is accessible through another competitive exam, even more selective. It lasts four years and gives another diploma of specialist like in medicine (DES for \"[[dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es]]\" ).\nStudents must specialise when entering the 5th year, and choose between dispensing pharmacy, pharmaceutical industry or hospital residency. In any case, a 12-month part-time hospital externship is mandatory during the fifth year, although some flexibility is possible for students choosing industry.\n\nSixth year for industry is generally dedicated to further specialisation with a former Professional [[master's degree]] or a former Research master's degree including internship.\n\nIn France, since the harmonization of European Union in September 2005, the student who chooses the industry/research orientation have a six-month period of part-time hospital externship, and 3 to 6 months of full-time training in a pharmaceutical industry or a research lab.\n\n=== Hungary ===\n\nIn Hungary, pharmacists obtain their master's degree, after five years of study. In the fifth year, students must undergo a professional training, that lasts for two+two months (autumn and spring) in a public pharmacy and one month in a hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled for practicing the profession of pharmacy, after acquiring the pharmacist work license. According to the new law in 2008, which is valid from 2009, all pharmacists, who have acquired the master's degree of Pharmacy, are entitled to the Doctor of Pharmacy.\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nIn order to obtain the state diploma of \"Doctor of Pharmacy\", the studies last a minimum of 5 years, or 9 years for students choosing residency ([[hospital pharmacy]], [[Clinical Pathology|medical biology]]) or [[pharmacology]]. In Italy the Professional degree in Pharmacy lasts 5 years, which includes a 6-month professional training in a public pharmacy or hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled to practise as a pharmacist. The subscription to \"Pharmacist's Order\", or in Italian \"Ordine dei Farmacisti\", is required for working in private and public pharmacies or hospitals. It is not required if the pharmacist is working at a pharmaceutical company. Besides the professional degree in Pharmacy, the title of Doctor of Pharmacy can be achieved in Italy by obtaining a MSc in Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technology (Chimica e Tecnologia Farmaceutiche, CTF) and then subscribing to the \"Pharmacist's Order\".\n\n===Malta===\n\nIn Malta, the warrant to practice as a pharmacist is given after the Master of Pharmacy course is completed successfully. The University of Malta, however, offers a Level 8 Postgraduate Degree known as the Doctorate in Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) which expands the pharmacist's knowledge on clinical, pharmacoeconomic, and regulatory aspects. The Doctorate in Pharmacy course is offered in collaboration with the University of Illinois in Chicago and uses a mixed-approach learning programme including theory and practical experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/icp/doctorate-in-pharmacy|title=Doctorate in Pharmacy - International Collaborative Programmes|website=www.um.edu.mt|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/ms/pharmacy/pharmd|title=Pharm.D. - Pharmacy - University of Malta|website=www.um.edu.mt|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\nThe education of pharmacists in the Netherlands requires a minimum of six years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and three master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. The Dutch consider the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy to be comparable to the Pharm.D. title in use in the United States. Before the harmonization a four-year Master of Science was superseded by two more years of university education preparing for pharmacy practice. To become a hospital pharmacist, a four-year residency program has to be completed after that.\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\nIn Portugal, pharmacy studies consists of four years of basic school, five years of preparatory school, and three years of high school, where afterward the student is submitted to nationwide exams. The process is the same for every degree the student chooses, from medicine to engineering.\nThe student takes the master's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences (equivalent to the PharmD program) in one of the nine Pharmacy faculties with their own respective numerous clausus which comprises a six-year rigorous study (5 with the uniformities in EU teaching). Finished the degree, the academic title of Doctor of Pharmacy is issued. The graduate can then enroll in the regulatory institution for the Pharmacist profession in Portugal called, \"Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society\" or, in Portuguese, \"Ordem dos Farmac\u00eauticos\". After the enrollment, the title of Pharmacist is issued. Afterwards, Pharmacists can start their career in a limitless number of professional areas that range from community pharmacies, drug development, fundamental or applied research, biotechnology to areas such as forensic sciences, toxicology, regulatory affairs, clinical analysis, law enforcement (scientific police), bromatology, drug marketing, regulatory authorities, university teachers, etc. The Pharmacists can also choose to become a specialist in one of following areas of activity: Pharmaceutical Industry, Regulatory Affairs, Hospital Pharmacy, and Clinical Analysis. Each specialization requires an additional 5-year professional study program guided by a tutor in the respective area of knowledge.  This training includes regular evaluations by the professional competent authority (\"Ordem dos Farmac\u00eauticos\"), which also requires an exam at the end of the 5-year training. After the success at the exam, the Pharmacist then becomes a specialist in its area of expertise.\n\n===Spain===\n\nIn Spain, Pharmacy studies can be accessed after completing five and a half years of university college (with at least 6 months of initiation to Pharmacy Practice). The ''Licenciado en Farmacia'' or ''Grado en Farmacia'' (equivalent to the Pharm.D. program) English degree is the only title that allows holders to practice the profession of Pharmacy in Spain. To become a Hospital Pharmacist a person with a degree in Pharmacy must enter a selection process (national selection process called FIR) to initiate a [[Pharmacy Residency]] period of professional training during 4 additional years (including one full year of advanced clinical practice in different medical wards). Apart from the professional degrees, like with any other university studies, Pharmacy degree allows holders to pursue an academic career by enrolling master's and doctorates programs (MSc and PhD) in several scientific fields (pharmaceutical technology, pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics, biomedical sciences, cosmetics & pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical and organic chemistry, physical chemistry, food sciences, pharmacology, toxicology, public health, etc.). Master's usually lasts 1\u20132 years and PhD no less than 4 years.\n\nIn summary, in Spain an entry-level pharmacy degree lasts 5 years and a ''Hospital Pharmacy Specialist'' needs 9.5 years of education and/or training. Hospital Pharmacy residents are paid during their residency period. There are other residencies available to pharmacists such as Medical Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology, Microbiology, Radiopharmacy, Pharmaceutical Analysis, and Industrial Pharmacy lasting from 2 to 4 years.\n\nPharmacists usually work as retail pharmacists (private practice), hospital pharmacists, primary care pharmacists, medical biologists, scientists (private and public biomedical research institutions), as university professors (Pharmacy, Medicine, Biology, Food Sciences, Biochemistry, Veterinary, Nursing, etc.), and as technicians and executive managers (pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and governmental institutions).\n\n===Sweden===\n\nPharmacy Doctors in Sweden have usually a Biomedicine Degree in Pharmacy direction. Biomedicine program is a 5-year education (3 years candidate + 2 years master) with a labor market in the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology and healthcare. The biomedicine program with Pharmacy / Pharmacology direction offered by universities in Gothenburg, Umea and Uppsala in Sweden.\n\nIn Sweden, the pharmacist (Apotekare) are not presented as a pharmacy doctors. Pharmacists (Apotekare) have the largest labor market in pharmacies or hospital pharmacies and can also work closely with health care to improve drug (Clinical Pharmacy). For example, in pharmacy business may pharmacists also work with education and teaching.\n\n==Middle East==\n\n=== Iran ===\n\nIn 1930 Tehran University changed the Pharmacy degree from master's to doctorate, and the duration of the study was increased to 5 years. Graduates need to present and defend their theses in different fields of pharmacy, and this adds another year to their studies, and generally after 6 years students can graduate as Doctor in Pharmacy. The master's degree in Pharmacy was available in Tehran University since 1926.\n\n===Israel===\n\nIn Israel the Pharm.D program is offered only by the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web |website=medicine.ekmd.huji.ac.il |url=https://medicine.ekmd.huji.ac.il/schools/pharmacy/En/home/Pages/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311045143/https://medicine.ekmd.huji.ac.il/schools/pharmacy/En/home/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Unlike the United States and European countries, in order to practice pharmacy in Israel, only a bachelor's degree is required.\n\n=== Jordan ===\n\nIn Jordan, the Pharm.D. program is offered by the [[University of Jordan]] and [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]] at the undergraduate level. This program is not to be confused with the BSc. in Pharmacy program even though both programs are still offered today. Students complete 5 years of academical work and 1 year of clinical practice to earn the degree. This program is offered at public universities only: at the University of Jordan and Jordan University of Science and Technology. The University of Jordan calls this degree BSc. in Doctor of Pharmacy, which is granted after a successful completion of 216 credit hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/Lists/OurPrograms/Undergraduate.aspx|title=Our Programs :: Undergradute Programs|work=ju.edu.jo|access-date=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212915/http://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/Lists/OurPrograms/Undergraduate.aspx|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Jordan University of Science and Technology has a similar credit hour requirement and calls the degree the BSc. of Doctor of Pharmacy degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/FacultiesandDepartments/FacultyofPharmacy/Pages/viewplan.aspx?planno=80|title=viewplan|website=www.just.edu.jo}}</ref>\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n\nPharmacy degree is awarded by several Lebanese universities (upon a decree by the Lebanese government).\n\nThe Lebanese American University awards a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree that is accredited by the ACPE. The program extends over six years (two years of pre-pharmacy and four professional years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.lau.edu.lb/education/graduate/pharmd.php|title=Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)|website=LAU School of Pharmacy|language=en|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Qatar ===\n\nIn Qatar, pharmacy degrees are offered by the new College of Pharmacy at the Qatar University. Students were accepted into the 5-year BSc (Pharm) program commencing in 2007. Students will be accepted into the final year of the 6-year Pharm.D program in 2011. Accordingly, the first graduates of the Pharm.D program are expected in 2012. The program adopts a Canadian curriculum and received early accreditation by the Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs (CCAPP) in February 2009. This is the first international program to undergo review and receive accreditation by this sole Canadian accreditation agency.\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\n\nStarted in 2001 at [[King Abdulaziz University]], then in 2005 at Ibn-Sina National College, then 2006 at KFU, then 2007 at Qassim University. In 2008, KSU College of Pharmacy at Riyadh, College of Pharmacy at Kharj, and Taif University. In 2009, Almaarefa College started their Pharm.D. program, and Shaqra University in 2011.\n\nThe degree duration in Saudi Arabia is six years in total, including one academic year of clinical rotations. According to the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties, if a student graduates with a (minimum six years) Pharm.D. degree, then the graduate has the chance to further develop himself. This can be achieved by taking an Accredited Residency Training Program that is at least one year long (for a total of seven years, minimum). Upon successfully completing both the Residency program and the Pharm.D., the graduate can apply for Professional Equivalent (only equivalent in practice) to the master's degree in Pharmacy.\n\nThe Pharm.D degree is now offered by almost all pharmacy colleges in Saudi Arabia. This is a transitional period as this degree will replace the conventional Bachelor of pharmacy degree in near future and the old bachelor's degree will be phased out.\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\n\nThe Doctor of Pharmacy program started in 2008 by the College of Pharmacy, at [[Gulf Medical University]], Ajman.\nand it is accredited by the ministry of education accreditation\n\n== North America ==\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nCurrently, in Canada, the [[BPharm]] (and not Pharm.D.) is the minimum qualification required to practice pharmacy. In Canada the Pharm.D. program is offered in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and as a first professional degree as well as a postgraduate degree.  Students enrolled in the program must have graduated from a CCAPP (Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs) or an [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]] (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) school with an accredited teaching program or must have obtained a Certificate of Qualification from [[Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada|PEBC]].\n\nAs of 2007, the Pharm.D. professional degree program in French is offered at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] and, as of 2011, at the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]]. The [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] was the first Canadian university to offer the Pharm.D. program as a first professional degree instead of the BPharm in pharmacy. In 2013, the [[University of Alberta]] would be offering a Pharm.D. as a post-professional degree, and a BPharm is required for admission into the program. The [[University of Toronto]] replaced their entry-level [[BPharm]] curriculum with an entry-to-practice Pharm.D. curriculum in 2011, with approval being granted{{by whom|date=October 2018}} in 2013.\n\nThe Pharm.D. degree is also offered as a postgraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]] and the University of Toronto. However, by the year 2020, most, if not all Canadian Pharmacy schools will have changed their Entry-To-Practice programs that awarded successful graduates with a Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences to Entry-To-Practice Pharm.D. as the scope of practice for pharmacists continue to expand and change. Once this change is implemented, UBC will no longer have a separate 2-year Pharm.D. Program that is currently offered.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, the government of Ontario approved the University of Toronto and the [[University of Waterloo]] applications for the entry-to-practice Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Students graduating in 2015 will be the first cohort under this new undergraduate Pharm.D. program.\n\nDalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia) is in progress of transitioning to the Pharm.D. program. Undergraduate applicants will require a minimum two years of prerequisite courses.\n\nIn the Fall of 2017, [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] (St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador), also replaced their BPharm program with the Pharm.D. program, with the first graduating class expected in 2022. This program requires one full year of prerequisite courses.\n\nIn the Fall of 2018, the [[University of Alberta]] ([[Edmonton]], Alberta) replaced their four-year BSc. Pharm program with an entry to practise PharmD. program, also with the first graduating class expected in April 2022. However, since the spring of 2017 the university has offered current BSc. Pharm students the ability to bridge to the PharmD. program. This requires the students to take two extra summer semesters between their third and fourth years, as well as an extra 16 weeks of clinical rotations during their fourth year. Only students graduating between 2018 and 2021 will have had this option. As a result, currently the university is offering 3 possible means to obtain a PharmD degree. That is the 2 year PharmD program for practising pharmacists, those in the PharmD for BSc. Pharm students (PBS), and those in the entry to practise PharmD program. BSc. Pharm students who did not enrol in the PBS program between 2018 and 2021 will be the final students to graduate with a bachelor's degree from the faculty.\n\n===United States===\n\nIn the [[United States]], the Doctor of [[Pharmacy]] (Pharm.D.) is a professional degree that offers opportunities in research, teaching, clinical practice, industry, manufacturing, judicial, and a multitude of other areas.\n\nAfter completing the required prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree, pharmacy school is another four years. In general, the total collegiate timeline to become an entry level pharmacist is six to eight years; three to four years undergraduate prerequisite work/bachelor's degree then three (accelerated track) to four years professional doctorate.\n\nAcceptance to a Pharm.D. program is competitive.  Along with excellent natural science grades, most schools require students to take a pharmacy college admissions test<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmapplicants.com/schools_that_require_pcat.php|title=PharmApplicants.com - Pharmacy School Admission Statistics|work=pharmapplicants.com|access-date=29 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119225325/http://www.pharmapplicants.com/schools_that_require_pcat.php|archive-date=19 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> (PCAT) and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the Pharm.D. program. Due to the extensive admission requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, many pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school. Some institutions still offer six-year accelerated Pharm.D. programs (similar to six-year MD programs).\n\nResidency is an option that is typically one to two years in length. Graduating candidates typically apply their final year of the Pharm.D. program. The accrediting body for most residency positions is the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Applications are submitted through the Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service; which opens November 3rd each residency year. Residency sites interview candidates and a ranking occurs prior to a match process. \"The match\" is facilitated via the National Matching Services Inc. in conjunction with Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service website portal. A residency is useful; especially for new graduates who do not yet have adequate patient care experience or potentially seeking accelerated and additional experiential training.\n\nAn ACPE Accredited doctorate of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) is currently the only degree accepted by the [[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]] (NABP) to be eligible to \"sit\" for the [[NAPLEX|North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination]] (NAPLEX). Previously, the United States had a five-year [[bachelor's degree]] in pharmacy. For pharmacy graduates holding the [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees currently licensed in the United States wishing to attain the Pharm.D., there are programs available to bridge that gap. These programs are fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), but they are only available to current B.S.Pharm. graduates with a license to practice pharmacy in the United States.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior B.S. in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation,  hands-on clinical practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Requirements in the US to becoming a [[pharmacist]] include graduating with a Doctor of Pharmacy from an ACPE accredited program, conducting a specified number of hours in internship under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the NAPLEX, and passing a [[Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination]] (MPJE).\n\n== South America ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\n\nIn Brazil the title of pharmacist is awarded after completion of certified graduate studies; while the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate's professional license (issued by the regional pharmacy (Conselho Regional de Farmacia)).\n\nMany universities award sub-titles or co-titles including Biochemist and Industrial Pharmacist. University of S\u00e3o Paulo and a few others have awarded specialization titles for many years for their Pharmacy and Biochemistry graduate students, including toxicological and clinical analysis, food and nutrition and industrial pharmacy, which are also equivalent to different degrees in the US and Europe.\n\nWhereas Bachelor of Pharmacy takes a minimum of 4 years, the Pharmacist-Biochemist degree is completed by 4 and 1/2 years of full-time studies with at least 720 hours of internship. The student can opt to get the degree during evening and it takes 6 years with Saturday classes (full day) and also at least 720 hrs of internship.\n\nAlthough many universities grant a degree of Doctor in Pharmaceutical Sciences or Doctor in Pharmacy after completion of original research dissertation, those are not professional but a post-graduate course and do not grant permission to work as a pharmacist.\n\n=== Chile ===\n\nIn [[Chile]], the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 or 11 semesters of full-time studies in an accredited University.\nThe Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree, awarded after finishing 5.5-6 years of study (Bachelor in Pharmacy or Pharmaceutical Sciences), and then finish an internship of 6 months on the specialization area of the student (Pharmaceutical Lab, Community Pharmacy, Hospital Pharmacy) and/or a scientific thesis. The Chilean pharmacy professional degree of Qu\u00edmico Farmaceutico (Q.F.) is generally equivalent to the degree of PharmD.\n\nThe pharmacist can get a Master in Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSc), of 2 years, or a Doctorate in Pharmacology (PhD), of 4 years after finished the Bachelor, but these are Academic Degrees, needed for scientific career on investigation, but are not required to work in other professional areas.\n\n=== Colombia ===\n\nIn [[Colombia]], the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 semesters of full-time studies in an accredited University. The Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree. While the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate's professional license (issued by the Colegio Nacional de Quimicos Farmaceuticos de Colombia).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|Pharm.D.}}\n* [[List of pharmacy schools]]\n* [[Pharmacy residency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pharmacy}}\n[[Category:Pharmacy education]]\n[[Category:Doctoral degrees]]\n[[Category:Academic degrees in healthcare]]\nu\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date= November 2014}}\n{{more citations needed|date= November 2014}}\n}}\n\nA '''Doctor of Pharmacy''' ('''Pharm.D.'''; [[New Latin]] '''Pharmaciae Doctor''') is a [[professional doctorate]] in [[pharmacy]].

In many countries they are allowed to practice independently and can prescribe drugs directly to patients. A Pharm.D program has significant experiential or clinical education components in introductory and advanced levels for the safe and effective use of drugs. Experiential education prepares graduates to be practice-ready, as they already have spent a significant amount of time training in areas of direct patient care and research.

It is a professional degree after earning a B.sc in pharmaceutical science. The duration of the program consists of two calendar years. The first year consists of many didactic,pharmacotherapy ,pharmacokinetics, pharmaceutical care of many diseases. The second year consists of rotations or clinical cherkship in different specialties including ambulatory care ,oncology,cardiology,nephrology,pediatrics ...etc .from the universities that offer this degree, faculty of pharmacy Cairo University, faculty of pharmacy Ain Shams University, faculty of pharmacy Alexandria University, faculty of pharmacy Beni suef University.this degree is for practicing pharmacists who graduated from pharmacy schools with bachelor\u2019s of pharmacy to be more clinically oriented As of 2019 things has changed, the B.sc (5 years program) has been replaced with pharma D degree (6 years program) as the first qualification obtained which qualifies the student to legally practice pharmacy in Egypt.\n\n=== Ghana ===\n\nPharm.D is a 6-year course offered in Ghana from the academic year 2012/2013, initially by the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). It leads to the award of the Doctor of Pharmacy certificate making one eligible to qualify, register and operate as a licensed pharmacist. An aggregate of 06 in the WASSCE results is currently the acceptable cutoff point. Also, a year Top-up program was rolled out in the 2017/18 academic year for practicing pharmacists with the Bpharm qualification to obtain the Pharm.D qualification which will soon become the minimum degree for licensure. The University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS)-Volta Region (2016/17 academic year), The University of Ghana-Legon, Entrance University College of Health Sciences-Spintex and Central University College-Miotso (in 2018/19 academic year), have also rolled out the Pharm.D program.\n\nThe first graduating group of the Pharm.D course in Ghana graduated in 2018. Much is expected of them to change the practice of pharmacy in Ghana to be more patient-centered than drug-centered and they are anticipated in various hospitals all over the country.\n\n=== Morocco ===\n\nPharm.D. is a program offered at the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Rabat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medramo.ac.ma|title=medramo|work=medramo.ac.ma}}</ref> and the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmpc.ac.ma|title=Accueil|work=fmpc.ac.ma}}</ref>In Morocco, Pharm.D studies can only be accessed through a competitive examination (\"[[competitive exam|concours]]\", with [[numerus clausus]]) happening at the start of the first year of health studies. All candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools ([[secondary education in france|lyc\u00e9e]]). About a 100 students are accepted every year. In order to obtain the state diploma of \"Doctor of Pharmacy\", studies last a minimum of six years, or 11 years for students choosing [[Residency (pharmacy)|residency]] ([[clinical pharmacy|hospital/clinical pharmacy]], [[pharmaceutical industry]] or [[clinical pathology|medical biology]]). It is accessible through another two competitive exams, even more selective. The first (''Internat'') is accessible in the start of the sixth year, it grants residency after two years of [[internship (medicine)|internship]] and after the student defends their thesis. The second (''R\u00e9sidanat'') is accessible after obtaining the doctorate. [[Residency (pharmacy)|Residency]] lasts four years and gives another diploma of specialist like in medicine (DES for \"dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es\" ).\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n\nPresently, there are only three universities in Nigeria offering the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD.) program. These are the University of Benin, Benin City, Bayero University, Kano and University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The University of Benin commenced the program in 2001 following the approval given for the commencement of the program by the regulatory government agency for pharmacy education and practice in the country, Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN). It was however not until 2016 that the overall regulatory government agency for all university degree programs in the country, National Universities Commission (NUC), formally approved the PharmD degree program. The University of Benin PharmD program is a six-year undergraduate program. On successful completion of the program, students are awarded both the Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degree and the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree. Prior to the commencement of the program, the university offered a five-year BPharm degree program which commenced in 1970. In the PharmD program, students are given extensive didactic preclinical/professional clinical preparation as well as clinical training (including pharmaceutical care) in different hospitals and community pharmacies. Students are prepared to have knowledge on patients counselling,Drug information, pharmaceutical care, ADR reporting, pharmacovigilance and much more. Pharmacy council of Nigeria and the national professional body of pharmacists, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), have envisaged that in the near future, PharmD degree will become the minimum educational qualification for the registration/licensing of fresh graduates of Nigeria's pharmacy schools for practice in the country. Through the efforts of the PCN, most pharmacy schools in Nigeria are now intensifying their preparations to commence the PharmD degree program.\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nSince 2006, Pharm.D is a post-graduate course being offered by [[Rhodes University]].<ref>[http://www.ru.ac.za/applying/postgraduates/mastersanddoctors/mastersanddoctorsforms/ Rhodes University Masters and Doctoral courses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226041624/http://www.ru.ac.za/applying/postgraduates/mastersanddoctors/mastersanddoctorsforms/ |date=26 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Tunisia ===\n\nThe Pharm.D program has been available in Tunisia since 1975.\n\nThere is only one faculty in Tunisia that provides education for PharmD ; Faculty of pharmacy of Monastir.\n\nIt is a diverse program focusing on pharmaceutical sciences, chemistry and biology along with marketing and management.\nIt can have two minors : biological pharmacy and industrial pharmacy.\n\n==Asia==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n\nAt present a five-year professional degree is offered in various public universities in Bangladesh. Previously, it was a four-year degree (Graduation) and a one-year degree (Post-Graduation) in Pharmacy is offered in numerous universities of Bangladesh. The study material is taught in English. The textbooks, exams as well as thesis are also provided in English. The universities are the [[University of Dhaka]] since 1964, [[Jahangirnagar University]] since 1982, University of Chittagong, [[Rajshahi University]], [[Khulna University]], [[Jagannath University]], [[Pabna University of Science & Technology]], Jessore University of Science & Technology and [[Noakhali Science & Technology University]]. All of these are government universities. There are also 20 private universities in Bangladesh offering pharmacy education. Among them [[BGC Trust University Bangladesh]] (BGCTUB), [[Southeast University]] (SEU), [[East West University]], [[Northern University Bangladesh]] since 2003, [[Daffodil International University]] , University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC), Stamford University Bangladesh (SUB), Manarat International University (MIU), The University of Asia Pacific, [[International Islamic University Chittagong]], [[North South University]], ASA University Bangladesh (ASAUB) , City University (CU) and University of Development Alternative (UODA) are the top rated private universities. It is the best for home and abroad students. The B.Pharm is completed in 4 years and the M.Pharm in one year. Pharmacy Council of Bangladesh (PCB) is the Professional Regulatory Authority for Pharmacists in Bangladesh.\n\n===India===\n{{distinguish|DPharm}}\nPharm.D course introduced by the [[Government of India]] and [[Pharmacy Council of India]] in 2008.

The Pharm.D. Program (Pharmaceutical care or Industrial Pharmacy) is a six-year academic program.\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Belgium ===\n\nThe education of pharmacists in Belgium requires a minimum of five years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and two master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. Belgium considers the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy to be comparable to the Pharm.D. title used in the United States. To become a hospital pharmacist, a three-year residency program has to be completed after obtaining the M.Sc. in pharmaceutical sciences.\n\n=== Czech Republic and Slovakia ===\n\nIn both countries, the PharmDr. (Pharmaciae doctor) diploma can be obtained by pharmacists who have previously graduated in pharmacy ([[Magister (degree)|Magister]], Mgr.) (the undergraduate study of pharmacy takes five years). Applicants must defend a research or experimental thesis, and pass a rigorous examination. The PharmDr. title is highly prestigious and written in front of the name. It is different from the postgraduate [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree.\n\n=== France ===\n\nIn [[France]], Pharm.D studies can only be accessed through a competitive examination (\"[[Competitive examination|concours]]\", with ''[[numerus clausus]]'') happening at the end of the first year of health studies. Most candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools ([[lyc\u00e9e]]). In case of failure, it is possible to retry once. Yearly success rate depends on the university's current ''[[numerus clausus]]'' and the number or registered students, ranging from 10 to 30% bearing in mind that second-time participants are three to four times more likely to succeed than students trying for the first time.\n\nIn order to obtain the state diploma of \"Doctor of Pharmacy\", the studies last a minimum of six years, or nine years for students choosing residency ([[hospital pharmacy]] or [[Clinical Pathology|medical biology]]). It is accessible through another competitive exam, even more selective. It lasts four years and gives another diploma of specialist like in medicine (DES for \"[[dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es]]\" ).\nStudents must specialise when entering the 5th year, and choose between dispensing pharmacy, pharmaceutical industry or hospital residency. In any case, a 12-month part-time hospital externship is mandatory during the fifth year, although some flexibility is possible for students choosing industry.\n\nSixth year for industry is generally dedicated to further specialisation with a former Professional [[master's degree]] or a former Research master's degree including internship.\n\nIn France, since the harmonization of European Union in September 2005, the student who chooses the industry/research orientation have a six-month period of part-time hospital externship, and 3 to 6 months of full-time training in a pharmaceutical industry or a research lab.\n\n=== Hungary ===\n\nIn Hungary, pharmacists obtain their master's degree, after five years of study. In the fifth year, students must undergo a professional training, that lasts for two+two months (autumn and spring) in a public pharmacy and one month in a hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled for practicing the profession of pharmacy, after acquiring the pharmacist work license. According to the new law in 2008, which is valid from 2009, all pharmacists, who have acquired the master's degree of Pharmacy, are entitled to the Doctor of Pharmacy.\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nIn order to obtain the state diploma of \"Doctor of Pharmacy\", the studies last a minimum of 5 years, or 9 years for students choosing residency ([[hospital pharmacy]], [[Clinical Pathology|medical biology]]) or [[pharmacology]]. In Italy the Professional degree in Pharmacy lasts 5 years, which includes a 6-month professional training in a public pharmacy or hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled to practise as a pharmacist. The subscription to \"Pharmacist's Order\", or in Italian \"Ordine dei Farmacisti\", is required for working in private and public pharmacies or hospitals. It is not required if the pharmacist is working at a pharmaceutical company. Besides the professional degree in Pharmacy, the title of Doctor of Pharmacy can be achieved in Italy by obtaining a MSc in Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Technology (Chimica e Tecnologia Farmaceutiche, CTF) and then subscribing to the \"Pharmacist's Order\".\n\n===Malta===\n\nIn Malta, the warrant to practice as a pharmacist is given after the Master of Pharmacy course is completed successfully. The University of Malta, however, offers a Level 8 Postgraduate Degree known as the Doctorate in Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) which expands the pharmacist's knowledge on clinical, pharmacoeconomic, and regulatory aspects. The Doctorate in Pharmacy course is offered in collaboration with the University of Illinois in Chicago and uses a mixed-approach learning programme including theory and practical experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/icp/doctorate-in-pharmacy|title=Doctorate in Pharmacy - International Collaborative Programmes|website=www.um.edu.mt|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/ms/pharmacy/pharmd|title=Pharm.D. - Pharmacy - University of Malta|website=www.um.edu.mt|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\nThe education of pharmacists in the Netherlands requires a minimum of six years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and three master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. The Dutch consider the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) degree in pharmacy to be comparable to the Pharm.D. title in use in the United States. Before the harmonization a four-year Master of Science was superseded by two more years of university education preparing for pharmacy practice. To become a hospital pharmacist, a four-year residency program has to be completed after that.\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\nIn Portugal, pharmacy studies consists of four years of basic school, five years of preparatory school, and three years of high school, where afterward the student is submitted to nationwide exams. The process is the same for every degree the student chooses, from medicine to engineering.\nThe student takes the master's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences (equivalent to the PharmD program) in one of the nine Pharmacy faculties with their own respective numerous clausus which comprises a six-year rigorous study (5 with the uniformities in EU teaching). Finished the degree, the academic title of Doctor of Pharmacy is issued. The graduate can then enroll in the regulatory institution for the Pharmacist profession in Portugal called, \"Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society\" or, in Portuguese, \"Ordem dos Farmac\u00eauticos\". After the enrollment, the title of Pharmacist is issued. Afterwards, Pharmacists can start their career in a limitless number of professional areas that range from community pharmacies, drug development, fundamental or applied research, biotechnology to areas such as forensic sciences, toxicology, regulatory affairs, clinical analysis, law enforcement (scientific police), bromatology, drug marketing, regulatory authorities, university teachers, etc. The Pharmacists can also choose to become a specialist in one of following areas of activity: Pharmaceutical Industry, Regulatory Affairs, Hospital Pharmacy, and Clinical Analysis. Each specialization requires an additional 5-year professional study program guided by a tutor in the respective area of knowledge.  This training includes regular evaluations by the professional competent authority (\"Ordem dos Farmac\u00eauticos\"), which also requires an exam at the end of the 5-year training. After the success at the exam, the Pharmacist then becomes a specialist in its area of expertise.\n\n===Spain===\n\nIn Spain, Pharmacy studies can be accessed after completing five and a half years of university college (with at least 6 months of initiation to Pharmacy Practice). The ''Licenciado en Farmacia'' or ''Grado en Farmacia'' (equivalent to the Pharm.D. program) English degree is the only title that allows holders to practice the profession of Pharmacy in Spain. To become a Hospital Pharmacist a person with a degree in Pharmacy must enter a selection process (national selection process called FIR) to initiate a [[Pharmacy Residency]] period of professional training during 4 additional years (including one full year of advanced clinical practice in different medical wards). Apart from the professional degrees, like with any other university studies, Pharmacy degree allows holders to pursue an academic career by enrolling master's and doctorates programs (MSc and PhD) in several scientific fields (pharmaceutical technology, pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics, biomedical sciences, cosmetics & pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical and organic chemistry, physical chemistry, food sciences, pharmacology, toxicology, public health, etc.). Master's usually lasts 1\u20132 years and PhD no less than 4 years.\n\nIn summary, in Spain an entry-level pharmacy degree lasts 5 years and a ''Hospital Pharmacy Specialist'' needs 9.5 years of education and/or training. Hospital Pharmacy residents are paid during their residency period. There are other residencies available to pharmacists such as Medical Biology, Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology, Microbiology, Radiopharmacy, Pharmaceutical Analysis, and Industrial Pharmacy lasting from 2 to 4 years.\n\nPharmacists usually work as retail pharmacists (private practice), hospital pharmacists, primary care pharmacists, medical biologists, scientists (private and public biomedical research institutions), as university professors (Pharmacy, Medicine, Biology, Food Sciences, Biochemistry, Veterinary, Nursing, etc.), and as technicians and executive managers (pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and governmental institutions).\n\n===Sweden===\n\nPharmacy Doctors in Sweden have usually a Biomedicine Degree in Pharmacy direction. Biomedicine program is a 5-year education (3 years candidate + 2 years master) with a labor market in the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology and healthcare. The biomedicine program with Pharmacy / Pharmacology direction offered by universities in Gothenburg, Umea and Uppsala in Sweden.\n\nIn Sweden, the pharmacist (Apotekare) are not presented as a pharmacy doctors. Pharmacists (Apotekare) have the largest labor market in pharmacies or hospital pharmacies and can also work closely with health care to improve drug (Clinical Pharmacy). For example, in pharmacy business may pharmacists also work with education and teaching.\n\n==Middle East==\n\n=== Iran ===\n\nIn 1930 Tehran University changed the Pharmacy degree from master's to doctorate, and the duration of the study was increased to 5 years. Graduates need to present and defend their theses in different fields of pharmacy, and this adds another year to their studies, and generally after 6 years students can graduate as Doctor in Pharmacy. The master's degree in Pharmacy was available in Tehran University since 1926.\n\n===Israel===\n\nIn Israel the Pharm.D program is offered only by the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web |website=medicine.ekmd.huji.ac.il |url=https://medicine.ekmd.huji.ac.il/schools/pharmacy/En/home/Pages/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311045143/https://medicine.ekmd.huji.ac.il/schools/pharmacy/En/home/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date=11 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Unlike the United States and European countries, in order to practice pharmacy in Israel, only a bachelor's degree is required.\n\n=== Jordan ===\n\nIn Jordan, the Pharm.D. program is offered by the [[University of Jordan]] and [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]] at the undergraduate level. This program is not to be confused with the BSc. in Pharmacy program even though both programs are still offered today. Students complete 5 years of academical work and 1 year of clinical practice to earn the degree. This program is offered at public universities only: at the University of Jordan and Jordan University of Science and Technology. The University of Jordan calls this degree BSc. in Doctor of Pharmacy, which is granted after a successful completion of 216 credit hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/Lists/OurPrograms/Undergraduate.aspx|title=Our Programs :: Undergradute Programs|work=ju.edu.jo|access-date=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212915/http://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/Lists/OurPrograms/Undergraduate.aspx|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Jordan University of Science and Technology has a similar credit hour requirement and calls the degree the BSc. of Doctor of Pharmacy degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/FacultiesandDepartments/FacultyofPharmacy/Pages/viewplan.aspx?planno=80|title=viewplan|website=www.just.edu.jo}}</ref>\n\n=== Lebanon ===\n\nPharmacy degree is awarded by several Lebanese universities (upon a decree by the Lebanese government).\n\nThe Lebanese American University awards a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree that is accredited by the ACPE. The program extends over six years (two years of pre-pharmacy and four professional years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pharmacy.lau.edu.lb/education/graduate/pharmd.php|title=Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)|website=LAU School of Pharmacy|language=en|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Qatar ===\n\nIn Qatar, pharmacy degrees are offered by the new College of Pharmacy at the Qatar University. Students were accepted into the 5-year BSc (Pharm) program commencing in 2007. Students will be accepted into the final year of the 6-year Pharm.D program in 2011. Accordingly, the first graduates of the Pharm.D program are expected in 2012. The program adopts a Canadian curriculum and received early accreditation by the Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs (CCAPP) in February 2009. This is the first international program to undergo review and receive accreditation by this sole Canadian accreditation agency.\n\n=== Saudi Arabia ===\n\nStarted in 2001 at [[King Abdulaziz University]], then in 2005 at Ibn-Sina National College, then 2006 at KFU, then 2007 at Qassim University. In 2008, KSU College of Pharmacy at Riyadh, College of Pharmacy at Kharj, and Taif University. In 2009, Almaarefa College started their Pharm.D. program, and Shaqra University in 2011.\n\nThe degree duration in Saudi Arabia is six years in total, including one academic year of clinical rotations. According to the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties, if a student graduates with a (minimum six years) Pharm.D. degree, then the graduate has the chance to further develop himself. This can be achieved by taking an Accredited Residency Training Program that is at least one year long (for a total of seven years, minimum). Upon successfully completing both the Residency program and the Pharm.D., the graduate can apply for Professional Equivalent (only equivalent in practice) to the master's degree in Pharmacy.\n\nThe Pharm.D degree is now offered by almost all pharmacy colleges in Saudi Arabia. This is a transitional period as this degree will replace the conventional Bachelor of pharmacy degree in near future and the old bachelor's degree will be phased out.\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\n\nThe Doctor of Pharmacy program started in 2008 by the College of Pharmacy, at [[Gulf Medical University]], Ajman.\nand it is accredited by the ministry of education accreditation\n\n== North America ==\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nCurrently, in Canada, the [[BPharm]] (and not Pharm.D.) is the minimum qualification required to practice pharmacy. In Canada the Pharm.D. program is offered in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and as a first professional degree as well as a postgraduate degree.  Students enrolled in the program must have graduated from a CCAPP (Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs) or an [[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]] (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) school with an accredited teaching program or must have obtained a Certificate of Qualification from [[Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada|PEBC]].\n\nAs of 2007, the Pharm.D. professional degree program in French is offered at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] and, as of 2011, at the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]]. The [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] was the first Canadian university to offer the Pharm.D. program as a first professional degree instead of the BPharm in pharmacy. In 2013, the [[University of Alberta]] would be offering a Pharm.D. as a post-professional degree, and a BPharm is required for admission into the program. The [[University of Toronto]] replaced their entry-level [[BPharm]] curriculum with an entry-to-practice Pharm.D. curriculum in 2011, with approval being granted{{by whom|date=October 2018}} in 2013.\n\nThe Pharm.D. degree is also offered as a postgraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]] and the University of Toronto. However, by the year 2020, most, if not all Canadian Pharmacy schools will have changed their Entry-To-Practice programs that awarded successful graduates with a Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences to Entry-To-Practice Pharm.D. as the scope of practice for pharmacists continue to expand and change. Once this change is implemented, UBC will no longer have a separate 2-year Pharm.D. Program that is currently offered.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, the government of Ontario approved the University of Toronto and the [[University of Waterloo]] applications for the entry-to-practice Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Students graduating in 2015 will be the first cohort under this new undergraduate Pharm.D. program.\n\nDalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia) is in progress of transitioning to the Pharm.D. program. Undergraduate applicants will require a minimum two years of prerequisite courses.\n\nIn the Fall of 2017, [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] (St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador), also replaced their BPharm program with the Pharm.D. program, with the first graduating class expected in 2022. This program requires one full year of prerequisite courses.\n\nIn the Fall of 2018, the [[University of Alberta]] ([[Edmonton]], Alberta) replaced their four-year BSc. Pharm program with an entry to practise PharmD. program, also with the first graduating class expected in April 2022. However, since the spring of 2017 the university has offered current BSc. Pharm students the ability to bridge to the PharmD. program. This requires the students to take two extra summer semesters between their third and fourth years, as well as an extra 16 weeks of clinical rotations during their fourth year. Only students graduating between 2018 and 2021 will have had this option. As a result, currently the university is offering 3 possible means to obtain a PharmD degree. That is the 2 year PharmD program for practising pharmacists, those in the PharmD for BSc. Pharm students (PBS), and those in the entry to practise PharmD program. BSc. Pharm students who did not enrol in the PBS program between 2018 and 2021 will be the final students to graduate with a bachelor's degree from the faculty.\n\n===United States===\n\nIn the [[United States]], the Doctor of [[Pharmacy]] (Pharm.D.) is a professional degree that offers opportunities in research, teaching, clinical practice, industry, manufacturing, judicial, and a multitude of other areas.\n\nAfter completing the required prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree, pharmacy school is another four years. In general, the total collegiate timeline to become an entry level pharmacist is six to eight years; three to four years undergraduate prerequisite work/bachelor's degree then three (accelerated track) to four years professional doctorate.\n\nAcceptance to a Pharm.D. program is competitive.  Along with excellent natural science grades, most schools require students to take a pharmacy college admissions test<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmapplicants.com/schools_that_require_pcat.php|title=PharmApplicants.com - Pharmacy School Admission Statistics|work=pharmapplicants.com|access-date=29 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119225325/http://www.pharmapplicants.com/schools_that_require_pcat.php|archive-date=19 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> (PCAT) and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the Pharm.D. program. Due to the extensive admission requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, many pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school. Some institutions still offer six-year accelerated Pharm.D. programs (similar to six-year MD programs).\n\nResidency is an option that is typically one to two years in length. Graduating candidates typically apply their final year of the Pharm.D. program. The accrediting body for most residency positions is the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Applications are submitted through the Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service; which opens November 3rd each residency year. Residency sites interview candidates and a ranking occurs prior to a match process. \"The match\" is facilitated via the National Matching Services Inc. in conjunction with Pharmacy Online Residency Centralized Application Service website portal. A residency is useful; especially for new graduates who do not yet have adequate patient care experience or potentially seeking accelerated and additional experiential training.\n\nAn ACPE Accredited doctorate of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) is currently the only degree accepted by the [[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]] (NABP) to be eligible to \"sit\" for the [[NAPLEX|North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination]] (NAPLEX). Previously, the United States had a five-year [[bachelor's degree]] in pharmacy. For pharmacy graduates holding the [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees currently licensed in the United States wishing to attain the Pharm.D., there are programs available to bridge that gap. These programs are fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), but they are only available to current B.S.Pharm. graduates with a license to practice pharmacy in the United States.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior B.S. in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation,  hands-on clinical practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Requirements in the US to becoming a [[pharmacist]] include graduating with a Doctor of Pharmacy from an ACPE accredited program, conducting a specified number of hours in internship under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the NAPLEX, and passing a [[Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination]] (MPJE).\n\n== South America ==\n\n=== Brazil ===\n\nIn Brazil the title of pharmacist is awarded after completion of certified graduate studies; while the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate's professional license (issued by the regional pharmacy (Conselho Regional de Farmacia)).\n\nMany universities award sub-titles or co-titles including Biochemist and Industrial Pharmacist. University of S\u00e3o Paulo and a few others have awarded specialization titles for many years for their Pharmacy and Biochemistry graduate students, including toxicological and clinical analysis, food and nutrition and industrial pharmacy, which are also equivalent to different degrees in the US and Europe.\n\nWhereas Bachelor of Pharmacy takes a minimum of 4 years, the Pharmacist-Biochemist degree is completed by 4 and 1/2 years of full-time studies with at least 720 hours of internship. The student can opt to get the degree during evening and it takes 6 years with Saturday classes (full day) and also at least 720 hrs of internship.\n\nAlthough many universities grant a degree of Doctor in Pharmaceutical Sciences or Doctor in Pharmacy after completion of original research dissertation, those are not professional but a post-graduate course and do not grant permission to work as a pharmacist.\n\n=== Chile ===\n\nIn [[Chile]], the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 or 11 semesters of full-time studies in an accredited University.\nThe Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree, awarded after finishing 5.5-6 years of study (Bachelor in Pharmacy or Pharmaceutical Sciences), and then finish an internship of 6 months on the specialization area of the student (Pharmaceutical Lab, Community Pharmacy, Hospital Pharmacy) and/or a scientific thesis. The Chilean pharmacy professional degree of Qu\u00edmico Farmaceutico (Q.F.) is generally equivalent to the degree of PharmD.\n\nThe pharmacist can get a Master in Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSc), of 2 years, or a Doctorate in Pharmacology (PhD), of 4 years after finished the Bachelor, but these are Academic Degrees, needed for scientific career on investigation, but are not required to work in other professional areas.\n\n=== Colombia ===\n\nIn [[Colombia]], the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 semesters of full-time studies in an accredited University. The Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree. While the term Pharm.D. is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate's professional license (issued by the Colegio Nacional de Quimicos Farmaceuticos de Colombia).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary|Pharm.D.}}\n* [[List of pharmacy schools]]\n* [[Pharmacy residency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pharmacy}}\n[[Category:Pharmacy education]]\n[[Category:Doctoral degrees]]\n[[Category:Academic degrees in healthcare]]\nu\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: , \u2192 ,  (3), etc  \u2192 etc. , \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Pharmacy"}
