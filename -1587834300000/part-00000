The AE86 ultimately gained international prominence in the motorsport of [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]] and wide popularity in [[Production car racing|Showroom Stock]], [[Group A]], and [[Group N]], [[Rallying|Rally]] and Club racing.\n\nIn a [[joint venture]] with [[General Motors]], mildly restyled versions of the front-wheel drive AE82 sedan and liftback were locally manufactured and sold in the United States as the '''[[Chevrolet Chevy II / Nova#Fifth generation (1985\u20131988)|Chevrolet Nova]]'''.\n\n==Design==\nThe front-wheel-drive wheelbase was now 95.6 in (2,430&nbsp;mm).\n\nIt was the first Corolla to top the New Zealand top-ten lists, ending Ford's dominance of that market.

Although there was a five-door liftback model of the basic Corolla, the shorter FX hatchback was sold alongside it. The Corolla FX replaced the [[Toyota Starlet]] in North America.\n\nA [[DOHC]] [[multivalve|16-valve]] engine, designated ''[[Toyota A engine#4A|4A-GE]]'', was added in 1983 on the rear-drive cars.

This engine was also combined with the front-drive transaxle to power the [[MR layout|mid-engined]] [[Toyota MR2]].\n\nThe Sprinter sports cars, in two-door coup\u00e9 and three-door liftback forms, were notable for being the line's first use of pop-up headlamps, which the equivalent Corolla Levin sports models did not have. The liftback has a {{Cd|link=car|long=yes|0.34}}.\n\nLaunched in Japan in May 1983, it reached Europe (including the right-hand drive UK market) three months later, and sold well in most European markets.\n\n==Japan==\nThe 1.3 litre 2A engine was replaced by the more modern 12-valve [[Toyota E engine#2E|2E]] engine along with a May 1985 facelift at ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]'' locations.

During calendar 1985, Corolla sedans and Sprinter-type 5-door hatchbacks (sold under both Nova and Corolla nameplates) were added, with the Toyota-branded US built cars gradually superseding imports from Japan and Nova hatchbacks being offered from the 1986 model year. Only the Corolla FX hatchback, launched for 1987 to replace the 3-door [[Toyota AE86|AE86]] Corolla Sport liftback, was imported from Japan. The Nova's successor, the [[Geo Prizm]], was another American-built rebadged Corolla sold in the US from 1989 to 2002.\n\nWhile all the rear-wheel drive 80-series Corollas were AE86 chassis in North

Only the Corolla FX hatchback, launched for 1987 to replace the 3-door [[Toyota AE86|AE86]] Corolla Sport liftback, was imported from Japan.

The original site is now marked by a small park known as Chute Square at the intersection of University and Central Avenues. The school shut down following a financial crisis during the American Civil War, but reopened in 1867 with considerable financial help from [[John S. Pillsbury]]. It was upgraded from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] to a college in 1869.  Today, the university's Minneapolis campus is divided by the Mississippi River into an East and West Bank.\n\nThe campus now has buildings on both river banks. The East Bank, the main portion of the campus, covers {{convert|307|acre|ha}}. The West Bank is home to the [[University of Minnesota Law School]], the [[Humphrey School of Public Affairs]], the [[Carlson School of Management]], various social science buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nThe Minneapolis campus has several residence halls: 17th Avenue Hall, Centennial Hall, Frontier Hall, Territorial Hall, Pioneer Hall, Sanford Hall, Middlebrook Hall, and Comstock Hall.\n\n====East Bank====\n[[File:Northrop Mall 2.JPG|thumb|Northrop Mall]]\n[[File:Northrop Mall Winter.png|thumb|University of Minnesota East Bank campus in the winter]]\n[[File:Northrop Mall panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Mall panorama, from left: Ford Hall, Coffman Memorial Union, Kolthoff Hall, Smith Hall (in center of image), Walter Library, Johnston Hall, Northrop, and Morrill Hall]]\n[[File:AerialUMN-MPLS012506.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the Minneapolis campus, facing east]]\n[[File:UMN-NorthrupMall.jpg|thumb|East Bank]]\n[[File:Walter Library-20060904.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Library]], Northrop Mall]]\n[[File:University of Minnesota.jpg|thumb|East Bank campus in winter.

Burton Hall is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Development|College of Education and Human Development]]. Folwell Hall and Jones Hall are primarily used by the language departments. A residence hall, Sanford Hall, and a student-apartment complex, Roy Wilkins Hall, are in this area. This area is just south of the Dinkytown neighborhood and business area.\n\n'''Northrop Mall''', or '''the Mall area''', is arguably the center of the Minneapolis campus. The plan for the Mall was based on a design by [[Cass Gilbert]], although his scheme was too extravagant to be fully implemented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Larry|title=AIA Guide to the Twin Cities: The Essential Source on the Architecture of Minneapolis and St. Paul|year=2007|isbn=978-0-87351-540-5 |pages=127\u2013128}}</ref> Several of the campus's primary buildings surround the Mall area. Northrop, formerly known as [[Northrop Auditorium]], provides a northern anchor, with [[Coffman Memorial Union]] (CMU) to the south. Four of the larger buildings to the sides of the Mall are the primary [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] buildings (Vincent Hall, Tate Laboratory and Smith Hall, respectively) and [[Walter Library]]. The Mall area is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]], which is Minnesota's largest public or private college, and the [[University of Minnesota Institute of Technology|College of Science and Engineering]]. Behind CMU is another residence hall, Comstock Hall, and another student-apartment complex, Yudof Hall. The Northrop Mall Historic District was formally listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20180119.htm|title=Weekly List - National Register of Historic Places Official Website--Part of the National Park Service|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''The Health area''' is to the southeast of the Mall area and focuses on undergraduate buildings for [[biological science]] students, as well as the homes of the College of [[Pharmacy]], the School of [[Nursing]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], and [[Fairview Health Services|Fairview Hospitals and Clinics]]. This complex of buildings forms what is known as the [[University of Minnesota Medical Center]]. Part of the [[University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences|College of Biological Sciences]] is housed in this area.\n\n{{anchor|Superblock}}<!--the page [[Superblock (University of Minnesota)]] redirects to this anchor.-->Across the street from the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview is an area known as the \"Superblock,\" a four-city-block space comprising four residence halls (Pioneer, Frontier, Centennial and Territorial Halls). The Superblock is one of the most popular locations for on-campus housing because it has the largest concentration of students living on campus and has a multitude of social activities between the residence halls.\n\n'''The Athletic area''' is directly north of the Superblock and includes four recreation/athletic facilities: the University Recreation Center, Cooke Hall, the University Fieldhouse, and the [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)#University Aquatic center|University Aquatic Center]]. These facilities are all connected by tunnels and skyways, allowing students to use one locker room facility. North of this complex is the [[TCF Bank Stadium]], [[Williams Arena]], [[Mariucci Arena]], [[Ridder Arena]], and the Baseline Tennis Center.\n\n'''The Gateway area''', the easternmost section of campus, is primarily composed of office buildings instead of classrooms and lecture halls. The most prominent building is [[McNamara Alumni Center]]. The university is also heavily invested in a [[biomedical|biomedical research]] initiative and has built five biomedical research buildings that form a biomedical complex directly north of TCF Bank Stadium.\n\n=====Notable architecture=====\n[[File:Pillsbury Hall.jpg|thumb|[[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], one of the oldest buildings on campus (1889)]]\n[[File:Weisman Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]]]\n\n[[University of Minnesota Armory|The Armory]], northeast of the Mall area, is built like a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]]. It features a [[sally port|sally-port]] entrance facing Church Street and a tower that was originally intended to be the professor of [[military science]]'s residence. Since it originally held the athletics department, the Armory also features a [[gym]]nasium. Today it is home to military science classes and the university's [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]].\n\nSeveral buildings in the [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District|Old Campus Historic District]] were designed by early Minnesota architect [[Leroy Buffington|LeRoy Buffington]]. One of the most notable is [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], designed by Buffington and Harvey Ellis in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style. Pillsbury Hall's [[polychromatic]] facade incorporates several sandstone varieties that were available in Minnesota during the time of construction. Buffington also designed the exterior of [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Burton Hall, 1894|Burton Hall]], considered one of the strongest specimens of [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] architecture in Minnesota.\n\nMany of the buildings on the East Bank were designed by the prolific Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston, Sr.|Clarence H. Johnston]], including the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] Folwell Hall and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] edifices of [[Northrop Auditorium]] and [[Walter Library]], which he considered the heart of the university. Johnston's son, Clarence Johnston Jr, was also an architect and designed the original [[Bell Museum of Natural History|Bell Museum]] building and [[Coffman Memorial Union]] in the 1930s.\n\nIn more recent years, [[Frank Gehry]] designed the [[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]. Completed in 1993, the Weisman Art Museum is a typical example of his work with curving metallic structures. The abstract structure is considered highly significant because it was built prior to the widespread use of [[computer aided design]] in architecture. It also ushered in a new era of architecture at the university, which continued with the completion of the [[McNamara Alumni Center]] in 2000 and Bruininks Hall (formerly STSS) in 2010.\n\nAnother notable structure is the addition to the Architecture building, designed by [[Steven Holl]] and completed in 2002. It won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award for its innovative design. The Architecture building was then renamed Rapson Hall after the local [[modernist architecture|modernist]] architect and School of Architecture Dean [[Ralph Rapson]].\n\nThe university also has a \"Greek row\" of historic [[fraternities and sororities]] located north of campus on University Avenue SE. {{main|List of Fraternities and Sororities at the University of Minnesota}}\n\n====West Bank====\n[[File:Rarig Center-20071213.jpg|thumb|Department of Theatre Arts &amp; Dance, Rarig Center]]\nThe '''West Bank''' covers {{convert|53|acre|ha}}.

Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].\n\nWilson Library, the largest library in the university system, is also on the West Bank, as is Middlebrook Hall, the largest residence hall on campus. Approximately 900 students reside in the building named in honor of William T. Middlebrook.<ref>Middlebrook served the University as Comptroller, VP of Business Administration, and was a longtime Secretary of the Board of Regents. He wrote a seminal text on estimating building needs for colleges and universities. Middlebrook graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1912, where he was a member of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]].</ref>\n\n====Getting around====\n[[File:Washington Avenue Bridge Minneapolis.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the [[Minneapolis]] campus.]]\n[[File:Green Line, Coffman Union, and bus stop.jpg|thumb|A [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] train after leaving the [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank Station]], heading towards [[Downtown Minneapolis]]]]\nThe [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] crossing the Mississippi River provides access between the East and West Banks, on foot and via designated bike lanes and a free shuttle service. The bridge has two separate [[deck (bridge)|deck]]s: the lower deck for vehicles and the newly constructed light rail, and the upper deck for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. An unheated enclosed walkway runs the length of the bridge and shelters pedestrians from the weather. Walking and riding bicycles are the most common modes of transportation among students. University Police occasionally cite individuals for [[jaywalking]] or riding bicycles on restricted sidewalks in areas surrounding the university, resulting in fines as high as $250. This is often done at the beginning of a school year or after pedestrians interfere with traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pedestrians should exercise caution|work=The Minnesota Daily|date=September 29, 2006 |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/09/29/69182|accessdate=December 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212212526/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/09/29/69182 |archivedate=February 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSeveral pedestrian tunnels ease the passage from building to building during harsh weather; they are marked with signs reading \"[[The Gopher Way]].\"\n\nThe Minneapolis campus is near [[Interstate Highway System|Interstates]] [[Interstate 94|94]] and [[Interstate 35|35W]] and is bordered by the Minneapolis neighborhoods of [[Dinkytown]] (on the north), [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|Cedar-Riverside]] (on the west), [[Stadium Village]] (on the southeast), and [[Prospect Park, Minneapolis|Prospect Park]] (on the east).\n\nThree [[Light rail in Minnesota|light-rail stations]] serve the university along the [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]]: [[Stadium Village (Metro Transit station)|Stadium Village]], [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank]], and [[West Bank (Metro Transit station)|West Bank]].

The ''Daily'' is operated by an autonomous organization run entirely by students. It was first published on May 1, 1900. Besides everyday news coverage, the paper has also published special issues, such as the Grapevine Awards, Ski-U-Mah, the Bar & Beer Guide, Sex-U-Mah, and others.\n\nA long-defunct but fondly remembered humor magazine, ''[[Ski-U-Mah (magazine)|Ski-U-Mah]]'', was published from about 1930 to 1950. It launched the career of novelist and scriptwriter [[Max Shulman]].\n\nA relative newcomer to the university's print media community is ''[[The Wake Student Magazine]]'', a weekly that covers UMN-related stories and provides a forum for student expression. It was founded in November 2001 in an effort to diversify campus media and achieved student group status in February 2002.<ref name=\"fund\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sua.umn.edu/groups/funding/fees/requests/studentorgs/thewake.pdf?PHPSESSID=1|title=2008\u20132009 Student Organization Student Services Fees Request|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=January 25, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> Students from many disciplines do all of the reporting, writing, editing, illustration, photography, layout, and business management for the publication.

''Liminal'' was created in the absence of an undergraduate literary journal and continues to bring poetry and prose to the university community.\n\n''The Wake'' has faced a number of challenges during its existence, due in part to the reliance on student fees funding. In April 2004, after the Student Services Fees Committee had initially declined to fund it, the needed $60,000 in funding was restored, allowing the magazine to continue publishing.<ref name=\"dead\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/07/9112 |title=Official Restores Wake's Funding|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=April 7, 2004|first=Jens |last=Krogstad|work=The Minnesota Daily |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040625230120/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/07/9112|archivedate=June 25, 2004}}</ref> It faced further challenges in 2005, when its request for additional funding to publish weekly was denied<ref name=\"dead2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/02/18/63317|title=Wake Awaits Fees Decision |accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=February 18, 2005|first=Bryce|last=Haugen|newspaper=The Minnesota Daily |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220004605/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/02/18/63317|archivedate=February 20, 2005}}</ref> and then partially restored.<ref name=\"dead4\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/03/10/63664|title=Final Recommendations In|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=March 10, 2005|first=Bryce|last=Haugen|newspaper=The Minnesota Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312130639/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/03/10/63664|archivedate=March 12, 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 conservatives on campus began formulating a new monthly magazine named ''The'' ''Minnesota Republic''. The first issue was released in February 2006, and funding by student service fees started in September 2006.\n\n====Radio====\nThe campus radio station, [[KUOM]] \"Radio K,\" broadcasts an eclectic variety of [[independent music]] during the day on 770 [[kHz]] [[AM radio|AM]]. Its 5,000-watt signal has a range of {{convert|80|mi|km}}, but shuts down at dusk because of [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations. In 2003, the station added a low-power (8-watt) signal on 106.5&nbsp;MHz [[FM radio|FM]] overnight and on weekends. In 2005, a 10-watt translator began broadcasting from Falcon Heights on 100.7 FM at all times. Radio K also [[Internet radio|stream]]s its content at www.radiok.org. With roots in experimental transmissions that began before World War I, the station received the first AM broadcast license in the state on January 13, 1922, and began broadcasting as [[Radio K|WLB]], changing to the KUOM [[radio call sign|call sign]] about two decades later. The station had an educational format until 1993, when it merged with a smaller campus-only music station to become what is now known as Radio K. A small group of full-time employees are joined by over 20 part-time student employees who oversee the station. Most of the on-air talent consists of student volunteers.\n\n====Television====\nSome television programs made on campus have been broadcast on local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[KTCI]] channel 17. Several episodes of ''Great Conversations'' have been made since 2002, featuring one-on-one discussions between University faculty and experts brought in from around the world. ''Tech Talk'' was a show meant to help people who feel intimidated by modern technology, including cellular phones and computers.\n\n===Minnesota Student Association===\nThe Minnesota Student Association (MSA) is the undergraduate student government at the University of Minnesota. It advocates for student interests on local, state, and federal levels, and focuses on efforts that directly benefit the student population.\n\n\"Gopher Chauffeur,\" originally titled the MSA Express, is a student-operated late-night ride service.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/12/13/70274|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103094323/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/12/13/70274|title=Hitch a ride with MSA |newspaper= [[Minnesota Daily]]|archivedate=January 3, 2007 }}</ref> Piloted by MSA, the 2007\u20132008 administration of Emma Olson and Ross Skattum began the process of transitioning the service to the university's Boynton Health Services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2008/04/17/boyntonto-run-msa-express-0|title=Boynton to run MSA Express|newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]]}}</ref> This was done to ensure its longevity.

It is the largest and most comprehensive graduate/professional student governance organization in the United States. GAPSA serves students in the [[Carlson School of Management]], the Dental School, the Graduate School, the [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the School of Nursing, the College of Pharmacy, the School of Public Health, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and the [[College of Education and Human Development]]. GAPSA is also a member of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.\n\nThe University of Minnesota has the second-largest number of graduate and professional students in the United States at over 16,000. All registered [[graduate student|graduate]] and [[professional students]] at UMN are members of GAPSA. It was established in 1990 as a nonprofit (IRS 501 (c)(3)) confederation of independent college councils representing all graduate and professional students at the University of Minnesota to the Board of Regents, the president of the University, the University Senate, UMN at large and the wider community. GAPSA serves as a resource for member councils, as the primary contact point for administrative units, as a graduate and professional student policy-making and policy-influencing body, and as a center of intercollegiate and intracollegiate interaction among students.\n\n===Athletics===\nMinnesota's Twin Cities campus athletics teams are called the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] and are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA) in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). As of 2019, they have won 19 NCAA championships <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf |title=Championships Summary through June 26, 2019 |publisher=NCAA |date=June 26, 2019 |accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref> and claim nine national football championships.<ref>{{cite web |title=College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS |website=College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers}}\nSince the 2013\u201314 school year, the only Minnesota team that does not compete in the Big Ten is the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|women's ice hockey team]], which competes in the WCHA. The Gophers [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey team]] was a longtime WCHA member, but left when the Big Ten began operating a [[Big Ten Conference (ice hockey)|men's ice hockey league]] with six inaugural members. The current athletic director, Mark Coyle, took the position from interim athletic director [[Beth Goetz]] after [[Norwood Teague]] resigned in August 2015 amid sexual assault allegations. Teague replaced [[Joel Maturi]].\n\nThe Golden Gophers' most notable rivalry is the annual college football game against the [[Wisconsin Badgers]] ([[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin) for [[Paul Bunyan's Axe]]. The two universities also compete in the Border Battle, a year-long athletic competition in which each sport season is worth 40 points divided by the number of times the teams play each other (i.e. football is worth 40 points because they play each other only once, while women's ice hockey is worth 10 points per game because they play four times a year). Conference and postseason [[playoffs]] do not count in the point standings.\n\n[[Goldy Gopher]] is the mascot for the Twin Cities campus and the associated sports teams. The [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] mascot is a tradition as old as the state, which was tabbed the \"Gopher State\" in 1857 after a political cartoon ridiculing the $5 million railroad loan that helped open up the West. The cartoon portrayed shifty railroad barons as striped gophers pulling a railroad car carrying the Territorial Legislature. Later, the university picked up the nickname with the first university [[yearbook]], bearing the name \"Gopher Annual,\" appearing in 1887.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Rouser]] is UMN's [[fight song]]. It is commonly played and sung by the 320-member [[University of Minnesota Marching Band|Minnesota Marching Band]] at events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games. Other songs associated with the university include the [[Minnesota March]], which was composed for the university by [[John Philip Sousa]], and [[Hail! Minnesota]], the university's [[Alma mater (song)|alma mater]] and [[state song]] of Minnesota.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cla.umn.edu/music/ensembles-creative-work/marching-band/history-traditions/school-songs|title=School Songs|work=College of Liberal Arts {{!}} University of Minnesota|access-date=August 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Football====\n{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers football}}\n[[File:TCF Bank Stadium opener.jpg|thumb|right|[[TCF Bank Stadium]] replaced the [[Hubert H.

They have won seven [[national championship]]s and 18 [[List of Big Ten National Championships|Big Ten Conference Championships]]. The Golden Gophers played their first game on September 29, 1882, a 4\u20130 victory over [[Hamline University]], St. Paul. In 1887, the Golden Gophers played host to the Wisconsin Badgers in a 63\u20130 victory. With the exception of 1906, the Golden Gophers and the Badgers have played each other every year since. The 128 games played against each other make this the most played rivalry in NCAA Division I FBS college football.\n\nIn 1981, the Golden Gophers played their last game in [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. Between 1982 and 2008, the school played their home games in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in downtown Minneapolis. They moved back to campus on September 12, 2009, when their new home, [[TCF Bank Stadium]], opened with a game against the [[2009 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force Falcons]] of the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]].\n\n====Basketball====\n{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball}}\nThe Golden Gophers men's basketball team has won two [[Helms Athletic Foundation#NCAA Basketball National Champions|National Championships]], two [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) Championships, and eight Big Ten Regular Season Championships. They also have six [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, including a [[Final Four]] appearance in 1997 and three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet 16]] appearances. However, because of [[University of Minnesota basketball scandal|NCAA sanctions for academic fraud]], all postseason appearances from 1994 to 1998\u2014in the NCAA Tournament in 1994, 1995, and 1997 and NIT in 1996 and 1998\u2014were vacated.

The original site is now marked by a small park known as Chute Square at the intersection of University and Central Avenues. The school shut down following a financial crisis during the American Civil War, but reopened in 1867 with considerable financial help from [[John S. Pillsbury]]. It was upgraded from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] to a college in 1869.  Today, the university's Minneapolis campus is divided by the Mississippi River into an East and West Bank.\n\nThe campus now has buildings on both river banks. The East Bank, the main portion of the campus, covers {{convert|307|acre|ha}}. The West Bank is home to the [[University of Minnesota Law School]], the [[Humphrey School of Public Affairs]], the [[Carlson School of Management]], various social science buildings, and the performing arts center.\n\nThe Minneapolis campus has several residence halls: 17th Avenue Hall, Centennial Hall, Frontier Hall, Territorial Hall, Pioneer Hall, Sanford Hall, Middlebrook Hall, and Comstock Hall.\n\n====East Bank====\n[[File:Northrop Mall 2.JPG|thumb|Northrop Mall]]\n[[File:Northrop Mall Winter.png|thumb|University of Minnesota East Bank campus in the winter]]\n[[File:Northrop Mall panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Mall panorama, from left: Ford Hall, Coffman Memorial Union, Kolthoff Hall, Smith Hall (in center of image), Walter Library, Johnston Hall, Northrop, and Morrill Hall]]\n[[File:AerialUMN-MPLS012506.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the Minneapolis campus, facing east]]\n[[File:UMN-NorthrupMall.jpg|thumb|East Bank]]\n[[File:Walter Library-20060904.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Library]], Northrop Mall]]\n[[File:University of Minnesota.jpg|thumb|East Bank campus in winter.

Burton Hall is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Development|College of Education and Human Development]]. Folwell Hall and Jones Hall are primarily used by the language departments. A residence hall, Sanford Hall, and a student-apartment complex, Roy Wilkins Hall, are in this area. This area is just south of the Dinkytown neighborhood and business area.\n\n'''Northrop Mall''', or '''the Mall area''', is arguably the center of the Minneapolis campus. The plan for the Mall was based on a design by [[Cass Gilbert]], although his scheme was too extravagant to be fully implemented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Larry|title=AIA Guide to the Twin Cities: The Essential Source on the Architecture of Minneapolis and St. Paul|year=2007|isbn=978-0-87351-540-5 |pages=127\u2013128}}</ref> Several of the campus's primary buildings surround the Mall area. Northrop, formerly known as [[Northrop Auditorium]], provides a northern anchor, with [[Coffman Memorial Union]] (CMU) to the south. Four of the larger buildings to the sides of the Mall are the primary [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] buildings (Vincent Hall, Tate Laboratory and Smith Hall, respectively) and [[Walter Library]]. The Mall area is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]], which is Minnesota's largest public or private college, and the [[University of Minnesota Institute of Technology|College of Science and Engineering]]. Behind CMU is another residence hall, Comstock Hall, and another student-apartment complex, Yudof Hall. The Northrop Mall Historic District was formally listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20180119.htm|title=Weekly List - National Register of Historic Places Official Website--Part of the National Park Service|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''The Health area''' is to the southeast of the Mall area and focuses on undergraduate buildings for [[biological science]] students, as well as the homes of the College of [[Pharmacy]], the School of [[Nursing]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], and [[Fairview Health Services|Fairview Hospitals and Clinics]]. This complex of buildings forms what is known as the [[University of Minnesota Medical Center]]. Part of the [[University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences|College of Biological Sciences]] is housed in this area.\n\n{{anchor|Superblock}}<!--the page [[Superblock (University of Minnesota)]] redirects to this anchor.-->Across the street from the University of Minnesota Medical Center Fairview is an area known as the \"Superblock,\" a four-city-block space comprising four residence halls (Pioneer, Frontier, Centennial and Territorial Halls). The Superblock is one of the most popular locations for on-campus housing because it has the largest concentration of students living on campus and has a multitude of social activities between the residence halls.\n\n'''The Athletic area''' is directly north of the Superblock and includes four recreation/athletic facilities: the University Recreation Center, Cooke Hall, the University Fieldhouse, and the [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)#University Aquatic center|University Aquatic Center]]. These facilities are all connected by tunnels and skyways, allowing students to use one locker room facility. North of this complex is the [[TCF Bank Stadium]], [[Williams Arena]], [[Mariucci Arena]], [[Ridder Arena]], and the Baseline Tennis Center.\n\n'''The Gateway area''', the easternmost section of campus, is primarily composed of office buildings instead of classrooms and lecture halls. The most prominent building is [[McNamara Alumni Center]]. The university is also heavily invested in a [[biomedical|biomedical research]] initiative and has built five biomedical research buildings that form a biomedical complex directly north of TCF Bank Stadium.\n\n=====Notable architecture=====\n[[File:Pillsbury Hall.jpg|thumb|[[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], one of the oldest buildings on campus (1889)]]\n[[File:Weisman Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]]]\n\n[[University of Minnesota Armory|The Armory]], northeast of the Mall area, is built like a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]]. It features a [[sally port|sally-port]] entrance facing Church Street and a tower that was originally intended to be the professor of [[military science]]'s residence. Since it originally held the athletics department, the Armory also features a [[gym]]nasium. Today it is home to military science classes and the university's [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]].\n\nSeveral buildings in the [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District|Old Campus Historic District]] were designed by early Minnesota architect [[Leroy Buffington|LeRoy Buffington]]. One of the most notable is [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], designed by Buffington and Harvey Ellis in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style. Pillsbury Hall's [[polychromatic]] facade incorporates several sandstone varieties that were available in Minnesota during the time of construction. Buffington also designed the exterior of [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Burton Hall, 1894|Burton Hall]], considered one of the strongest specimens of [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] architecture in Minnesota.\n\nMany of the buildings on the East Bank were designed by the prolific Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston, Sr.|Clarence H. Johnston]], including the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] Folwell Hall and the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] edifices of [[Northrop Auditorium]] and [[Walter Library]], which he considered the heart of the university. Johnston's son, Clarence Johnston Jr, was also an architect and designed the original [[Bell Museum of Natural History|Bell Museum]] building and [[Coffman Memorial Union]] in the 1930s.\n\nIn more recent years, [[Frank Gehry]] designed the [[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]. Completed in 1993, the Weisman Art Museum is a typical example of his work with curving metallic structures. The abstract structure is considered highly significant because it was built prior to the widespread use of [[computer aided design]] in architecture. It also ushered in a new era of architecture at the university, which continued with the completion of the [[McNamara Alumni Center]] in 2000 and Bruininks Hall (formerly STSS) in 2010.\n\nAnother notable structure is the addition to the Architecture building, designed by [[Steven Holl]] and completed in 2002. It won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award for its innovative design. The Architecture building was then renamed Rapson Hall after the local [[modernist architecture|modernist]] architect and School of Architecture Dean [[Ralph Rapson]].\n\nThe university also has a \"Greek row\" of historic [[fraternities and sororities]] located north of campus on University Avenue SE. {{main|List of Fraternities and Sororities at the University of Minnesota}}\n\n====West Bank====\n[[File:Rarig Center-20071213.jpg|thumb|Department of Theatre Arts &amp; Dance, Rarig Center]]\nThe '''West Bank''' covers {{convert|53|acre|ha}}.

Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].\n\nWilson Library, the largest library in the university system, is also on the West Bank, as is Middlebrook Hall, the largest residence hall on campus. Approximately 900 students reside in the building named in honor of William T. Middlebrook.<ref>Middlebrook served the University as Comptroller, VP of Business Administration, and was a longtime Secretary of the Board of Regents. He wrote a seminal text on estimating building needs for colleges and universities. Middlebrook graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1912, where he was a member of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]].</ref>\n\n====Getting around====\n[[File:Washington Avenue Bridge Minneapolis.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the [[Minneapolis]] campus.]]\n[[File:Green Line, Coffman Union, and bus stop.jpg|thumb|A [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] train after leaving the [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank Station]], heading towards [[Downtown Minneapolis]]]]\nThe [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] crossing the Mississippi River provides access between the East and West Banks, on foot and via designated bike lanes and a free shuttle service. The bridge has two separate [[deck (bridge)|deck]]s: the lower deck for vehicles and the newly constructed light rail, and the upper deck for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. An unheated enclosed walkway runs the length of the bridge and shelters pedestrians from the weather. Walking and riding bicycles are the most common modes of transportation among students. University Police occasionally cite individuals for [[jaywalking]] or riding bicycles on restricted sidewalks in areas surrounding the university, resulting in fines as high as $250.

The ''Daily'' is operated by an autonomous organization run entirely by students. It was first published on May 1, 1900. Besides everyday news coverage, the paper has also published special issues, such as the Grapevine Awards, Ski-U-Mah, the Bar & Beer Guide, Sex-U-Mah, and others.\n\nA long-defunct but fondly remembered humor magazine, ''[[Ski-U-Mah (magazine)|Ski-U-Mah]]'', was published from about 1930 to 1950. It launched the career of novelist and scriptwriter [[Max Shulman]].\n\nA relative newcomer to the university's print media community is ''[[The Wake Student Magazine]]'', a weekly that covers UMN-related stories and provides a forum for student expression.

''Liminal'' was created in the absence of an undergraduate literary journal and continues to bring poetry and prose to the university community.\n\n''The Wake'' has faced a number of challenges during its existence, due in part to the reliance on student fees funding.

The first issue was released in February 2006, and funding by student service fees started in September 2006.\n\n====Radio====\nThe campus radio station, [[KUOM]] \"Radio K,\" broadcasts an eclectic variety of [[independent music]] during the day on 770 [[kHz]] [[AM radio|AM]]. Its 5,000-watt signal has a range of {{convert|80|mi|km}}, but shuts down at dusk because of [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations. In 2003, the station added a low-power (8-watt) signal on 106.5&nbsp;MHz [[FM radio|FM]] overnight and on weekends. In 2005, a 10-watt translator began broadcasting from Falcon Heights on 100.7 FM at all times. Radio K also [[Internet radio|stream]]s its content at www.radiok.org. With roots in experimental transmissions that began before World War I, the station received the first AM broadcast license in the state on January 13, 1922, and began broadcasting as [[Radio K|WLB]], changing to the KUOM [[radio call sign|call sign]] about two decades later. The station had an educational format until 1993, when it merged with a smaller campus-only music station to become what is now known as Radio K. A small group of full-time employees are joined by over 20 part-time student employees who oversee the station. Most of the on-air talent consists of student volunteers.\n\n====Television====\nSome television programs made on campus have been broadcast on local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[KTCI]] channel 17. Several episodes of ''Great Conversations'' have been made since 2002, featuring one-on-one discussions between University faculty and experts brought in from around the world. ''Tech Talk'' was a show meant to help people who feel intimidated by modern technology, including cellular phones and computers.\n\n===Minnesota Student Association===\nThe Minnesota Student Association (MSA) is the undergraduate student government at the University of Minnesota.

It is the largest and most comprehensive graduate/professional student governance organization in the United States. GAPSA serves students in the [[Carlson School of Management]], the Dental School, the Graduate School, the [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the School of Nursing, the College of Pharmacy, the School of Public Health, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and the [[College of Education and Human Development]]. GAPSA is also a member of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.\n\nThe University of Minnesota has the second-largest number of graduate and professional students in the United States at over 16,000. All registered [[graduate student|graduate]] and [[professional students]] at UMN are members of GAPSA. It was established in 1990 as a nonprofit (IRS 501 (c)(3)) confederation of independent college councils representing all graduate and professional students at the University of Minnesota to the Board of Regents, the president of the University, the University Senate, UMN at large and the wider community. GAPSA serves as a resource for member councils, as the primary contact point for administrative units, as a graduate and professional student policy-making and policy-influencing body, and as a center of intercollegiate and intracollegiate interaction among students.\n\n===Athletics===\nMinnesota's Twin Cities campus athletics teams are called the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] and are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA) in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).

The Gophers [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey team]] was a longtime WCHA member, but left when the Big Ten began operating a [[Big Ten Conference (ice hockey)|men's ice hockey league]] with six inaugural members. The current athletic director, Mark Coyle, took the position from interim athletic director [[Beth Goetz]] after [[Norwood Teague]] resigned in August 2015 amid sexual assault allegations. Teague replaced [[Joel Maturi]].\n\nThe Golden Gophers' most notable rivalry is the annual college football game against the [[Wisconsin Badgers]] ([[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin) for [[Paul Bunyan's Axe]]. The two universities also compete in the Border Battle, a year-long athletic competition in which each sport season is worth 40 points divided by the number of times the teams play each other (i.e. football is worth 40 points because they play each other only once, while women's ice hockey is worth 10 points per game because they play four times a year). Conference and postseason [[playoffs]] do not count in the point standings.\n\n[[Goldy Gopher]] is the mascot for the Twin Cities campus and the associated sports teams. The [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] mascot is a tradition as old as the state, which was tabbed the \"Gopher State\" in 1857 after a political cartoon ridiculing the $5 million railroad loan that helped open up the West. The cartoon portrayed shifty railroad barons as striped gophers pulling a railroad car carrying the Territorial Legislature. Later, the university picked up the nickname with the first university [[yearbook]], bearing the name \"Gopher Annual,\" appearing in 1887.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Rouser]] is UMN's [[fight song]]. It is commonly played and sung by the 320-member [[University of Minnesota Marching Band|Minnesota Marching Band]] at events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games. Other songs associated with the university include the [[Minnesota March]], which was composed for the university by [[John Philip Sousa]], and [[Hail!

The Golden Gophers played their first game on September 29, 1882, a 4\u20130 victory over [[Hamline University]], St. Paul. In 1887, the Golden Gophers played host to the Wisconsin Badgers in a 63\u20130 victory. With the exception of 1906, the Golden Gophers and the Badgers have played each other every year since. The 128 games played against each other make this the most played rivalry in NCAA Division I FBS college football.\n\nIn 1981, the Golden Gophers played their last game in [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. Between 1982 and 2008, the school played their home games in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in downtown Minneapolis. They moved back to campus on September 12, 2009, when their new home, [[TCF Bank Stadium]], opened with a game against the [[2009 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force Falcons]] of the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]].\n\n====Basketball====\n{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball}}\nThe Golden Gophers men's basketball team has won two [[Helms Athletic Foundation#NCAA Basketball National Champions|National Championships]], two [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) Championships, and eight Big Ten Regular Season Championships.
