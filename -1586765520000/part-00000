Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M.

Meier integrierte der junge Islam bei seiner raschen Expansion viele heidnische Gottheiten in sein System, indem er sie zu D\u00e4monen degradierte. 1. Im Islam wird die Existenz von Geistern, die weder Engel noch unbedingt Teufel sein m\u00fcssen, anerkannt. 2.

Since they are mentioned in Islamic texts, scholars such as [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] prohibit the denial of jinn. They also refer to spirits and demons among the Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews to \"prove\" their existence.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Ibn Taymiyya believed the jinn to be generally \"ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous\". He held that the jinn account for much of the \"magic\" that is perceived by humans, cooperating with magicians to lift items in the air, delivering hidden truths to fortune tellers, and mimicking the voices of deceased humans during seances.<ref name=\"taym\">[[Ibn Taymiyyah]], ''al-Furq\u0101n bayna awliy\u0101\u2019 al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n wa-awliy\u0101\u2019 al-Shay\u1e6d\u0101n'' (\"Essay on the Jinn\"), translated by Abu Ameenah Bilal Phillips</ref>\n\nOther critics, such as [[Jahiz]] and [[Mas'udi]], related sightings of jinn to psychological causes. According to Mas'udi, the jinn as described by traditional scholars, are not [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] false, but improbable. Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''wasw\u0101s'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn. However, Jahiz is less critical about jinn and demons than Mas'udi, stating human fantasy at least encourage people to imagine such creatures.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.37 (German)</ref> The Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101t al-Makkiyya, attributed to the famous Sufi Shaikh [[Ibn Arabi]], reconciles a literal existence of jinn with the imaginal, describing the appearance of ''jinn'' as a reflection of the observer and the place they are found.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process.

Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M.

If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways.

Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of Shinkansen trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

Currently the Tokaido Shinkansen has a minimum connection time of 2 hours 19 minutes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maglev car design unveiled |date=28 October 2010| url =http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nb20101028a2.html |work = The Japan Times| pages = |accessdate = 28 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhile the government has granted approval<ref>{{cite news |title=Most direct line for maglev gets panel OK |date=16 December 2010| url =http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nb20101216a2.html |work = The Japan Times |pages = |accessdate = 16 December 2010}}</ref> for the shortest route between Tokyo and Nagoya, some prefectural governments, particularly Nagano, lobbied to have the line routed farther north to serve the city of [[Chino, Nagano|Chino]] and either [[Ina, Nagano|Ina]] or {{STN|Kiso-Fukushima}}.

It is planned to go via [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], about 40&nbsp;km south of [[Kyoto]]. Kyoto is lobbying to have the route moved north and be largely aligned with the existing [[Tokaido Shinkansen]], which services Kyoto and not Nara.<ref>{{cite news | title=Economy, prestige at stake in Kyoto-Nara maglev battle | date=3 May 2012| url =http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120503f1.html | work = The Japan Times| pages = | accessdate =3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Mini-Shinkansen ===\n{{Nihongo|Mini-shinkansen|\u30df\u30cb\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda}} is the name given to the routes where former narrow gauge lines have been converted to standard gauge to allow Shinkansen trains to travel to cities without the expense of constructing full Shinkansen standard lines.\n\nTwo mini-shinkansen routes have been constructed: the [[Yamagata Shinkansen]] and [[Akita Shinkansen]]. Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at [[Shin-Yatsushiro Station]] (on [[Kyushu]]), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000&nbsp;km, following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies.<ref name=\"mynavi20141224\">{{cite web |url= http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2014/12/24/335/ |script-title=ja:\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u6b20\u640d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u8010\u4e45\u8d70\u884c\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u4f11\u6b62 |trans-title= Kyushu Shinkansen Free Gauge Train endurance testing suspended following discovery of defects |date= 24 December 2014|work= Mynavi News|publisher= Mynavi Corporation |location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 27 December 2014}}</ref> The train was being trialled between [[Kumamoto]], travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to [[Kagoshima]].

GCTs were proposed to provide the Shinkansen service from the line's scheduled opening in fiscal 2022, however with the GCT now being unavailable for service until at least 2025, other options are being considered, such as a [[Tsubame (train)#Relay Tsubame|'relay']] service.<ref name=\"ajw.asahi.com\"/>\n\n==Types of lines ==\n\nThe main Shinkansen lines are:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Line\n!rowspan=2|Start\n!rowspan=2|End\n!colspan=2|Length\n!rowspan=2|Operator\n!rowspan=2|Opened\n!rowspan=2|Annual passengers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/saisintoukei.html |title=\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u8abf\u67fb\uff08\u5e73\u621023\u5e74\u5ea6\u3001\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\uff09 Rail Transport Statistics (2011, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport) (Japanese) |publisher=Mlit.go.jp |date= |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n!km\n!mi\n|-\n![[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]\n|[[Tokyo Station|Tokyo]]||[[Shin-\u014csaka Station|Shin-Osaka]]\n|{{convert|515.4|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|[[JR Central]]||1964||143,015,000\n|-\n![[San'y\u014d Shinkansen]]\n|[[Shin-\u014csaka Station|Shin-Osaka]]||[[Hakata Station|Hakata]]\n|{{convert|553.7|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|[[JR West]]||1972\u20131975||64,355,000\n|-\n![[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]]\n|[[Tokyo Station|Tokyo]]||[[Shin-Aomori Station|Shin-Aomori]]\n|{{convert|674.9|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[JR East]]||1982\u20132010||76,177,000\n|-\n![[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]]\n|[[\u014cmiya Station (Saitama)|\u014cmiya]]||[[Niigata Station|Niigata]]\n|{{convert|269.5|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|1982||34,831,000\n|-\n![[Hokuriku Shinkansen]]\n|[[Takasaki Station|Takasaki]]||[[Kanazawa Station|Kanazawa]]\n|{{convert|345.4|km|mi|disp=table}}\n||[[JR East]] and [[JR West]]||1997\u20132015||9,420,000\n|-\n![[Kyushu Shinkansen]]\n|[[Hakata Station|Hakata]]||[[Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d Station|Kagoshima-Ch\u016b\u014d]]\n|{{convert|256.8|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|[[JR Kyushu]]||2004\u20132011||12,143,000\n|-\n![[Hokkaido Shinkansen]]\n|[[Shin-Aomori Station|Shin-Aomori]]||[[Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto Station|Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto]]\n|{{convert|148.9|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|[[JR Hokkaido]]||2016||\n|}\n\nIn practice, the Tokaido, San'y\u014d, and Kyushu lines form a contiguous west/southbound line from Tokyo, as train services run between the Tokaido and San'y\u014d lines and between the San'y\u014d and Kyushu lines, though the lines are operated by different companies.\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen is not physically connected to the lines of the Tohoku Shinkansen at Tokyo Station. Therefore, there is no through service between those lines. All northbound services from Tokyo travel along the Tohoku Shinkansen until at least \u014cmiya.\n\nTwo further lines, known as ''[[Mini-shinkansen]]'', have also been constructed by re-gauging and upgrading existing sections of line:\n* [[Yamagata Shinkansen]] ([[Fukushima Station (Fukushima)|Fukushima]] \u2013 [[Shinj\u014d Station|Shinj\u014d]])\n* [[Akita Shinkansen]] ([[Morioka Station|Morioka]] \u2013 [[Akita Station|Akita]])\n\nThere are two standard-gauge lines not technically classified as Shinkansen lines but with Shinkansen services:\n* [[Hakata Minami Line]] ([[Hakata Station|Hakata]] \u2013 [[Hakata-Minami Station|Hakata-Minami]])\n* [[Gala-Yuzawa Line]] \u2013 technically a branch of the [[J\u014detsu Line]] \u2013 ([[Echigo-Yuzawa Station|Echigo-Yuzawa]] \u2013 [[Gala-Yuzawa Station|Gala-Yuzawa]])\n\n=== Future lines ===\nMany Shinkansen lines were proposed during the boom of the early 1970s but have yet to be constructed. These are called {{Nihongo|''Seibi Shinkansen''|\u6574\u5099\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda}} or ''planned Shinkansen''. One of these lines, the [[Narita Shinkansen]] to [[Narita International Airport|Narita Airport]], was officially cancelled, but a few remain under development.\n* [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] extension from [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]] to [[Tsuruga, Fukui|Tsuruga]] is under construction and is scheduled to open in fiscal 2022. Between Hakusan Depot near Kanazawa and Tsuruga, the [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]] Shinkansen station was constructed in conjunction with the rebuilding of the adjoining conventional (narrow gauge) line station in anticipation of construction of the line to Osaka. The extension of the line to [[Osaka]] is proposed, with the route via Obama and Kyoto selected by the government on 20 December 2016.<ref name=\"railwaygazette.com\"/> Construction is proposed to commence in 2030, and take 15 years.\n* Construction of the West Kyushu Shinkansen branch from [[Tosu, Saga|Shin-Tosu]] to [[Nagasaki]], known as the {{Nihongo|''Nagasaki Route''|\u9577\u5d0e\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8}} or {{Nihongo|''Nishi-Kyushu Route''|\u897f\u4e5d\u5dde\u30eb\u30fc\u30c8}}, started in 2008 and is proposed to open in fiscal 2022. The branch will be partially built to full Shinkansen standards (Takeo Onsen \u2013 Nagasaki) with the existing narrow-gauge line from Shin-Tosu \u2013 Takeo Onsen to remain as narrow-gauge track.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started.

Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours. JAL is reported to have reduced the size of planes servicing this route since the Shinkansen extension opened in 2010.<ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\"/>\n* Tokyo \u2013 Hokuriku (345&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 2\u00bd hours. ANA is reported to have reduced the number of services from Tokyo to Kanazawa and Toyama from 6 to 4 per day since the Shinkansen extension opened in 2015.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals.

Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

However, technical issues with the development of the GCT bogies means the train will not be available for service until at least 2025, requiring consideration of other options such as [[Tsubame (train)#Relay Tsubame|'relay']] service to ensure the line can open on schedule in fiscal 2022.<ref name=\"ajw.asahi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225105059/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |archivedate=25 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal shortens the distance between Hakata and Nagasaki by 6.2% (9.6&nbsp;km), and while only 64% of the route will be built to full Shinkansen standards, it will eliminate the slowest sections of the existing narrow gauge route. Use of the GCT was estimated to result in a time saving of 28.5% (32 minutes) on the current timetable. The proposed time saving if a 'relay' service is introduced is unknown at this time.\n\nAs part of this proposal, the current 12.8&nbsp;km section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen is proposed to be duplicated. However, due to the delay in the development of the GCT, the proposal has not advanced.\n\nWith the completion of excavation of the 1351m Enogushi tunnel, being the sixth tunnel completed in this section, approximately 25% of the 40.7&nbsp;km of tunnel excavation work on the Takeo Onsen \u2013 Nagasaki section has been finished.

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at [[Shin-Yatsushiro Station]] (on [[Kyushu]]), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000&nbsp;km, following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies.<ref name=\"mynavi20141224\">{{cite web |url= http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2014/12/24/335/ |script-title=ja:\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u6b20\u640d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u8010\u4e45\u8d70\u884c\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u4f11\u6b62 |trans-title= Kyushu Shinkansen Free Gauge Train endurance testing suspended following discovery of defects |date= 24 December 2014|work= Mynavi News|publisher= Mynavi Corporation |location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 27 December 2014}}</ref> The train was being trialled between [[Kumamoto]], travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to [[Kagoshima]].

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot. [[JR Central]] called the plan \"unrealistic\" due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Maehara sounds out JR Tokai over shinkansen link for Haneda airport|newspaper= Japan Today|date= 28 December 2009|url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/maehara-sounds-out-jr-tokai-over-shinkansen-link-for-haneda-airport|accessdate= 28 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Line\n!colspan=2|Speed\n!colspan=2|Length\n!rowspan=2|Construction began/proposed\n!rowspan=2|Expected start of revenue services\n|-\n!km/h\n!mph\n!km\n!mi\n|-\n| [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] (West Kyushu Route)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|66.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2009 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] Phase 3 (Kanazawa \u2013 Tsuruga)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|120.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2012 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] Phase 2 (Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto \u2013 Sapporo)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|211.3|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|2012 \n|FY2030\n|-\n| Hokuriku Shinkansen Phase 4 (Tsuruga \u2013 Obama \u2013 Kyoto \u2013 Shin-Osaka)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}} \n|2030 \n|FY2045\n|}\n\n== List of train types ==\nTrains are up to sixteen cars long.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started.

Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

The Vietnamese government had already given basic approval for the Shinkansen system, although it still requires financing and formal consent from the prime minister. Vietnam rejected a funding proposal in 2010, so funding for the $56 billion project is uncertain. Hanoi was exploring additional Japanese funding [[Official Development Assistance]] as well as funds from the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]]. The {{convert|1,560|km|mi|adj=on}} line would replace the current colonial-era rail line. [[Vietnam]] hoped to launch high-speed trains by 2020 and planned to start by building three sections, including a 90-kilometre stretch between the central coastal cities of [[Da Nang]] and [[Hu\u1ebf]], seen as potentially most profitable. Vietnam Railways had sent engineers to [[Central Japan Railway Company]] for technical training.<ref name=\"Nikkei\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkei.co.jp/news/kaigai/20090813AT2M1203A12082009.html|script-title=ja:\u30d9\u30c8\u30ca\u30e0\u7e26\u65ad\u3067\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda \u56fd\u55b6\u9244\u9053\u4f1a\u9577\u30012020\u5e74\u90e8\u5206\u958b\u696d\u76ee\u6307\u3059|publisher=The Nikkei Net|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904043603/http://www.nikkei.co.jp/news/kaigai/20090813AT2M1203A12082009.html|archive-date=4 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"AFP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gv5p5C0gfrQ43JZcXx7lZ39KyfTg |title=Vietnam plans Japanese bullet train link |publisher= AFP |date= 13 August 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transport in Japan]]\n* [[Rail transport in Japan]]\n* [[Shanghai Maglev Train]]\n* [[High speed rail in China]]\n* [[High speed rail in Europe]]\n* [[High speed rail in the United States]]\n* [[High speed rail in India]]\n{{Portal bar|Trains|Japan|Transport}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Shinkansen}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Rail travel in Japan}}\n* [http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/Hood.html Biting the Bullet: What we can learn from the Shinkansen], discussion paper by Christopher Hood in the [http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk ''electronic journal of contemporary Japanese studies''], 23 May 2001\n* [http://www.asahi.com/english/nation/TKY200410150138.html East meets West], a story of how the Shinkansen brought Tokyo and [[Osaka]] closer together.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071021055843/http://thehindubusinessline.com/life/2005/08/19/stories/2005081900120300.htm Bullet on wheels], a travel report by Vinod Jacob 19 August 2005\n* [http://www.accessible-japan.com/shinkansen-wheelchair-accessibility/ Shinkansen Wheelchair Accessibility], review for riders with disabilities.\n\n{{Shinkansen}}\n{{High-speed rail}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n<!-- Note to editors: This article is in Category:Shinkansen, which is already in Category:Rail transport in Japan, so please do not add [[Category:Rail transport in Japan]]. -->\n[[Category:Shinkansen| ]]\n[[Category:High-speed rail in Japan]]\n[[Category:High-speed trains]]\n[[Category:Rail transport brands]]\n[[Category:Railway services introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:1964 establishments in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Ellis678", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarthquake:format edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen"}
