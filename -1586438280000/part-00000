Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they can compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term \"gaming\" can refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional and digital forms, through [[online gambling]]. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]] or [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]]. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a [[Professional gamer|profession]] for some.\n\n== Origin of the term ''gamer'' ==\nThe term ''gamer'' originally meant ''[[gambling|gambler]]'', and has been in use since at least 1422, when the town laws of [[Walsall]], England, referred to \"any dice-player, carder, tennis player, or other unlawful gamer\". However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as [[wargame]]s. Wargames were originally created as a military and strategy tool. When ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' was released, it was originally marketed as a wargame, but later was described by its creators as a [[role-playing game]]. They too called their players ''gamers'' and this is where the word changed definition from someone who gambles to someone who plays [[board game]]s and/or [[video game]]s.<ref name=\"willaert\">{{cite web |last1=Willaert |first1=Kate |title=The Origin Of The Term \"Gamer\" |url=http://www.acriticalhit.com/origin-of-gamer/ |website=ACriticalHit |accessdate=June 26, 2019}}</ref>on 2012\n\n==Categories==\n{{Further|Video game#Demographics}}\nIn the United States as of 2018, 28% of gamers are under 18, 29% are 18-35, 20% are 36-49 and 23% are over 50.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/|title=U.S. average age of video gamers 2018 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref> In the UK as of 2014, 29% are under 18, 32% are 18-35 and 39% are over 36.<ref name=\"Facts and Figures\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/29/gaming-advocacy-group-the-average-gamer-is-31-and-most-play-on-a-console/|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Askaboutgames|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613033013/http://www.askaboutgames.com/?c=%2Fpages%2FfactsFigures.jsp|archivedate=June 13, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> According to [[Pew Research Center]], 49% of adults have played a video game at some point in their life and those who have are more likely to let their children or future children play.

However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online [[live streaming]] of their games. These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer.  Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Hitbox]], [[Mixer.com|Mixer]] and [[YouTube]].

They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=2004-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203445/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2004/07/gars-07142004.ars|archive-date=2011-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Classification in taxonomies===\n\nA number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\n* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.\n* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[glitch]]es, and expose all game mechanics.\n* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.\n* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.\n* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.\nThe [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Avatar==\n{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}\n{{See also|Player character}}\nCreating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|title=26 Important Steps To Become A Pro Gamer|date=2018-08-13|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121040/https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a [[middle name]], such as [[Ninja (video game player)|Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins]] or [[sinatraa|Jay \"sinatraa\" Won]].\n\nSimilarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\n==Clans and guilds==\nA [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\n==Identity==\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].<ref name=\"overlandClueless\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"[[cinemaphile]]\".<ref name=\"escapistPublisherNote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming|access-date=2015-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117150925/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|archive-date=2016-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\">{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014|access-date=2015-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123185112/http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"newmediaDoYou\">{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they can compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term \"gaming\" can refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional and digital forms, through [[online gambling]]. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]] or [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]]. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a [[Professional gamer|profession]] for some.\n\n== Origin of the term ''gamer'' ==\nThe term ''gamer'' originally meant ''[[gambling|gambler]]'', and has been in use since at least 1422, when the town laws of [[Walsall]], England, referred to \"any dice-player, carder, tennis player, or other unlawful gamer\". However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as [[wargame]]s.

These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer.  Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Hitbox]], [[Mixer.com|Mixer]] and [[YouTube]].

They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]].

They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.\nThe [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Avatar==\n{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}\n{{See also|Player character}}\nCreating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|title=26 Important Steps To Become A Pro Gamer|date=2018-08-13|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121040/https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a [[middle name]], such as [[Ninja (video game player)|Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins]] or [[sinatraa|Jay \"sinatraa\" Won]].\n\nSimilarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\n==Clans and guilds==\nA [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\n==Identity==\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].<ref name=\"overlandClueless\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"[[cinemaphile]]\".<ref name=\"escapistPublisherNote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming|access-date=2015-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117150925/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|archive-date=2016-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\">{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014|access-date=2015-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123185112/http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"newmediaDoYou\">{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

The battles in ''SFIV'' now begin with a short pre-fight intro, a small cinematic dialogue sequence which varies depending on the player's chosen character. A new system called Focus Attacks (Saving Attack for the Japanese version) has been introduced, as well as Ultra Moves. The traditional six-button control scheme has returned, with new features and Special Moves integrated into the input system, mixing classic gameplay with additional innovations.<ref name=1Up>{{cite web |last=Leone |first=Matt |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?Dispatch=Display&cId=3164756 |title=Street Fighter IV Unveiled: News from |website=1UP.com |accessdate=2015-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122025052/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?Dispatch=Display&cId=3164756 |archivedate=2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\nThe game has arguably a similar feel to ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'', but also has a few features from ''[[Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike]]''.<ref name=1uppreview1>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3166483|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526093142/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3166483|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-05-26|title=Street Fighter IV Arcade Preview, Street Fighter IV Preview|accessdate=2008-02-23|last=Kleckner|first=Stephen|date=2008-02-21}}</ref> As in ''[[Street Fighter III]]'', throwing is performed by pressing both light attack buttons, while pressing both heavy attack buttons performs the character's personal action or taunt.

Viper]] and [[Dan Hibiki|Dan]] (with the air taunt) are the only characters who can perform a high jump.<ref name=1uppreview1/>\n\nIt was intended that bonus rounds such as the car-smashing stage from earlier ''Street Fighter'' games would return. Ono later stated that the bonus stages would not be in the arcade game, citing the reason to be that the time players spend on bonus stages is time during which they have no chance of losing, which ultimately takes money from arcade operators.<ref name=\"captivate\">{{cite web |title= Producer Yoshinroi Ono divulges new information about the new challengers and the continuing story of the Street Fighter saga. |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34713.html |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605143639/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34713.html |archivedate=June 5, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"captivate2\">{{cite web |author= |url=http://kotaku.com/5012551/new-details-on-street-fighter-ivs-home-versions |title=New Details On Street Fighter IV's Home Versions |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref> The bonus stages were later added in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]''.

The Focus Attack is a move that allows the player to absorb an attack and launch a counterattack, and it is performed by pressing the medium punch and medium kick buttons simultaneously. There are two phases to the attack. In the first phase, the player will shift into a new stance, at which point he or she is able to absorb a single hit from the opponent. The second phase is the counterattack. The longer the player holds down the medium punch and kick buttons, the more powerful the attack will be. If the buttons are held for long enough the attack will be unblockable and cause the opponent to crumple slowly to the ground, allowing the player to follow up with a free hit. Attacks that were absorbed during the first phase of a Focus Attack still cause damage to the player; however, life lost from the opponent's attack will be quickly regenerated afterward. In addition, during the first phase of the Focus Attack, the player may perform a dash either forward or backward to cancel the Focus Attack. Finally, at the cost of two bars of the Super Combo gauge, many Special Moves can be canceled into a Focus Attack. By executing a Focus Attack during the Special Move, the animation of the move will be cut short and go instantly into the Focus Attack animation. This allows players with precise timing to cancel Special Moves into Focus Attacks, and in turn cancel Focus Attacks into the forward dash, resulting in new combo possibilities. If a Special Move is blocked by the opponent, the new system allows players to cancel the blocked move with a Focus Attack, and then cancel the Focus Attack by dashing backward safely away from the opponent. Ono has stated that this system was incorporated in order to shift the emphasis away from [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]] and toward a more realistic system he has compared to [[boxing]], in which \"the skill is in reading your opponent's move before he or she starts moving ... We haven't forgotten about combos and linked moves, but focus makes it so that you have to read your opponent.\"<ref name=edge-preview>{{cite journal|last = Anon. | date = December 20, 2007 | title = 2D or not 2D | journal = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | issue = 184 (Jan 2008) | pages = 47\u201353 | publisher = [[Future Publishing]] | location = [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]| url = | language = }}</ref> The system aims to make ground attacks as viable a way of approaching opponents as jumping was in previous games.<ref name=edge-preview/> The focus system is a core part of ''Street Fighter IV''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay.<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\nIn addition to the powered-up versions of Special Moves introduced in previous ''Street Fighter'' games such as Super Combos and EX Special Moves, the game also introduces a new type of powered-up Special Move officially dubbed the Ultra Combo. Ultra Combos are long and cinematic moves featuring a lengthy combination of punches, kicks and other fighting techniques. Just as there is a Super Combo gauge, there is also an Ultra Combo gauge (officially known as the Revenge Gauge or Revenge Meter), but whereas the Super Combo gauge fills up when the player hits their opponent or performs a Special Move, the Revenge Gauge fills when one takes damage from their opponent (similar to the K Groove featured in ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]''). Along with the Super Combos, Ultra Combos are one of the only times (besides Zangief, E. Honda, Seth and Abel's command throws) the camera breaks from its normal fixed position to show a more dynamic, cinematic view of the gameplay.<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=April 2019}}\n\n''Street Fighter IV'' takes place several months after the events of ''Street Fighter II'' (thus is chronologically set between ''Street Fighter II'' and ''III''). After [[M. Bison]]'s survival following his encounter with [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]], the S.I.N. corporation began another fighting tournament in order to draw out the most powerful fighters on Earth to complete the BLECE project. Each character has their own reasons for entering this tournament, but S.I.N.'s real desire is to lure Ryu to them in order to analyze the Satsui no Had\u014d, believed to be the last piece of data needed to complete BLECE.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Street Fighter characters}}\n\nChronologically set between the ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' series and the ''Street Fighter III'' series, the playable character roster of the arcade version includes the cast of the original ''Street Fighter II'' (all 12 characters, including the four Shadaloo Grand Masters) and four new characters. [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] from ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' also appears as a hidden playable character, as well as a secret opponent, for a total 17 playable characters. Additionally, the game includes two more secret characters: Seth as the game's standard final boss, and [[Gouken]] as a secret opponent, which makes for a total of 19 characters. The console version includes 6 more characters to the roster making for a total of 25, the returning characters are: [[Cammy (Street Fighter)|Cammy]], [[Dan (Street Fighter)|Dan]], [[Fei Long]], [[Gen (Street Fighter)|Gen]], [[Rose (Street Fighter)|Rose]] and [[Sakura (Street Fighter)|Sakura]].\n\nNewcomers:\n* {{Flagicon|France}} [[List of Street Fighter characters#Abel|Abel]], a French fighter who utilizes [[Full contact karate|full-contact karate]], [[Judo]] and Russian [[Sambo (martial art)|combat sambo]] to defeat opponents (note his kurtka).

Initially, there was much resistance to Ono's pitch for a new ''Street Fighter'' game so many years after the original. The gap from 2000 to 2008, since ''[[Street Fighter EX3]]'', the latest ''Street Fighter'' game at that point, represented the longest time the series had gone without a sequel. However, in light of fan demand plus the positive reception to ''[[Street Fighter II#Hyper Fighting|Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting]]'' on [[Xbox Live Arcade]], Inafune eventually allowed the project to begin.<ref name=\"EGM\">{{cite news|url=|title=The Big Comeback|last=Bettenhausen|first=Shane|date=January 2008|work=Electronic Gaming Monthly|access-date=|publisher=Ziff Davis|volume=224|pages=62\u201372}}</ref> This was Ono's first take on a new entry for the ''Street Fighter'' series as a producer, although he had previously worked on ''Street Fighter III 3rd Strike'' as a \"sound management director\" and previously produced ''[[Capcom Fighting Jam]]''. The experience provided by ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' became the main influence for the ''Street Fighter IV'' development team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/194282.html|title=GameTrailers interview with Yoshinori Ono|publisher=Gametrailers.com|accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe original game concept, titled ''Street Fighter IV Flashback'', imagined in part by [[David Sirlin]], the designer of ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix]]'', never made it past the proposal stage. ''Flashback'' would likewise feature the 2.5D gameplay and a roster made of classic ''Street Fighter II'' characters plus Sakura and a few new characters. The game would have also featured a single-player mode with third-person 3D action (similar to this of the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series) that focused on Ryu's backstory, as well as all ''Street Fighter'' arcade games in their original forms and a 3D version of ''Super Turbo''. ''Flashback'''s proposed easy control system was later used in ''[[Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars]]'', minus its titular \"flashback\" gameplay feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/02/17/before-street-fighter-iv-there-was-street-fighter-iv-flashback/ |title=Before Street Fighter IV There Was Street Fighter IV Flashback |publisher=Siliconera |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Street Fighter IV'' features models and backgrounds rendered in 3D, the gameplay remains on a traditional 2D plane, with the camera having freedom to move in 3D at certain times during fights, for dramatic effect, similar to the ''[[Street Fighter EX]]'' series Capcom produced with Arika. Initially the title had been developed to use 3D [[hitbox]]es, but the testers felt it did not have the \"pixel perfect\" precision of a ''Street Fighter'' game, and the game was therefore changed to use 2D hitboxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/sfiv-s-3d-polygons-could-have-ruined-hit-detection-172084.phtml|title=SFIV's 3D polygons could have ruined hit detection}}</ref> \nOno has also cited the arcade version of [[Arc System Works]]' ''[[Battle Fantasia]]'' as the inspiration for the game's three-dimensional art style.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web |title= Saving Street Fighter: Yoshi Ono on Building Street Fighter IV (Page 3)|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3791/saving_street_fighter_yoshi_ono_.php?page=3 |author= Sheffield, Brandon |date=2008-09-26 |website=Gamasutra |accessdate=2009-12-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109161513/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3791/saving_street_fighter_yoshi_ono_.php?page=3| archivedate= 2009-11-09 | url-status= live}}</ref> Art director and character designer Daigo Ikeno, who previously worked on ''Street Fighter III 3rd Strike'',<ref name=\"artist\">{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&cId=3165156 |title=Street Fighter 4 Preview for ARC from |website=1UP.com |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2015-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021923/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&cId=3165156 |archivedate=2015-11-17}}</ref> opted for [[non-photorealistic rendering]] to give them a hand-drawn look,<ref name=\"1Up\" /> with visual effects accented in calligraphic strokes, ink smudges and ink sprays during the fights.\n\n''Street Fighter IV''{{'}}s musical score was primarily composed by [[Hideyuki Fukasawa]]. The game's music consisted of new and old material created for it. Several music pieces (such as the themes for the returning ''SFII'' characters) were rearranged for ''SFIV''. While previous ''Street Fighter'' games contained limited voice work, ''Street Fighter IV'' was the first ''Street Fighter'' series game to feature extensive voice acting. The game offers a choice between the original Japanese or an English dub.\n\nThe game runs on the [[Taito Type X#Taito Type X2|Taito Type X<sup>2</sup>]] arcade board inside a [[Taito Vewlix]] cabinet.<ref name=\"famitsuarcade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1213478_1124.html |title=\u3010\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30ea\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u305d\u306e1\u3011\u300e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fcIV\u300f\u3042\u3044\u3064\u3089\u304c\u5e30\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f!! - Famitsu.com |publisher=Famitsu.com |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref> It takes advantage of the Type X<sup>2</sup>'s network capabilities and allows players in separate machines within the same LAN to fight each other.\n\n==Home versions==\n''Street Fighter IV'' was also released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and [[Microsoft Windows]], featuring additional playable characters and features not found in the arcade game.

Viper]] and [[Dan Hibiki|Dan]] (with the air taunt) are the only characters who can perform a high jump.<ref name=1uppreview1/>\n\nIt was intended that bonus rounds such as the car-smashing stage from earlier ''Street Fighter'' games would return. Ono later stated that the bonus stages would not be in the arcade game, citing the reason to be that the time players spend on bonus stages is time during which they have no chance of losing, which ultimately takes money from arcade operators.<ref name=\"captivate\">{{cite web |title= Producer Yoshinroi Ono divulges new information about the new challengers and the continuing story of the Street Fighter saga. |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34713.html |accessdate=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605143639/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34713.html |archivedate=June 5, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"captivate2\">{{cite web |author= |url=http://kotaku.com/5012551/new-details-on-street-fighter-ivs-home-versions |title=New Details On Street Fighter IV's Home Versions |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref> The bonus stages were later added in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]''. There are also Rival Battles which have a cutscene between two characters (which depends on who they are) before the battle starts.\n\nFocus Attacks, known as Saving Attack in the Japanese version,<ref name=JoystiqFeb22>{{cite web|last=Mitchell |first=Richard |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/22/gdc08-hands-on-with-street-fighter-iv/ |title=GDC08: hands-on with Street Fighter IV |publisher=Joystiq.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref> is a new system introduced in ''Street Fighter IV''. The Focus Attack is a move that allows the player to absorb an attack and launch a counterattack, and it is performed by pressing the medium punch and medium kick buttons simultaneously. There are two phases to the attack. In the first phase, the player will shift into a new stance, at which point he or she is able to absorb a single hit from the opponent. The second phase is the counterattack. The longer the player holds down the medium punch and kick buttons, the more powerful the attack will be. If the buttons are held for long enough the attack will be unblockable and cause the opponent to crumple slowly to the ground, allowing the player to follow up with a free hit. Attacks that were absorbed during the first phase of a Focus Attack still cause damage to the player; however, life lost from the opponent's attack will be quickly regenerated afterward. In addition, during the first phase of the Focus Attack, the player may perform a dash either forward or backward to cancel the Focus Attack. Finally, at the cost of two bars of the Super Combo gauge, many Special Moves can be canceled into a Focus Attack. By executing a Focus Attack during the Special Move, the animation of the move will be cut short and go instantly into the Focus Attack animation. This allows players with precise timing to cancel Special Moves into Focus Attacks, and in turn cancel Focus Attacks into the forward dash, resulting in new combo possibilities. If a Special Move is blocked by the opponent, the new system allows players to cancel the blocked move with a Focus Attack, and then cancel the Focus Attack by dashing backward safely away from the opponent. Ono has stated that this system was incorporated in order to shift the emphasis away from [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]] and toward a more realistic system he has compared to [[boxing]], in which \"the skill is in reading your opponent's move before he or she starts moving ... We haven't forgotten about combos and linked moves, but focus makes it so that you have to read your opponent.\"<ref name=edge-preview>{{cite journal|last = Anon. | date = December 20, 2007 | title = 2D or not 2D | journal = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | issue = 184 (Jan 2008) | pages = 47\u201353 | publisher = [[Future Publishing]] | location = [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]| url = | language = }}</ref> The system aims to make ground attacks as viable a way of approaching opponents as jumping was in previous games.<ref name=edge-preview/> The focus system is a core part of ''Street Fighter IV''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay.<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\nIn addition to the powered-up versions of Special Moves introduced in previous ''Street Fighter'' games such as Super Combos and EX Special Moves, the game also introduces a new type of powered-up Special Move officially dubbed the Ultra Combo. Ultra Combos are long and cinematic moves featuring a lengthy combination of punches, kicks and other fighting techniques. Just as there is a Super Combo gauge, there is also an Ultra Combo gauge (officially known as the Revenge Gauge or Revenge Meter), but whereas the Super Combo gauge fills up when the player hits their opponent or performs a Special Move, the Revenge Gauge fills when one takes damage from their opponent (similar to the K Groove featured in ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]''). Along with the Super Combos, Ultra Combos are one of the only times (besides Zangief, E. Honda, Seth and Abel's command throws) the camera breaks from its normal fixed position to show a more dynamic, cinematic view of the gameplay.<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=April 2019}}\n\n''Street Fighter IV'' takes place several months after the events of ''Street Fighter II'' (thus is chronologically set between ''Street Fighter II'' and ''III''). After [[M. Bison]]'s survival following his encounter with [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]], the S.I.N. corporation began another fighting tournament in order to draw out the most powerful fighters on Earth to complete the BLECE project. Each character has their own reasons for entering this tournament, but S.I.N.'s real desire is to lure Ryu to them in order to analyze the Satsui no Had\u014d, believed to be the last piece of data needed to complete BLECE.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Street Fighter characters}}\n\nChronologically set between the ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' series and the ''Street Fighter III'' series, the playable character roster of the arcade version includes the cast of the original ''Street Fighter II'' (all 12 characters, including the four Shadaloo Grand Masters) and four new characters. [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] from ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' also appears as a hidden playable character, as well as a secret opponent, for a total 17 playable characters. Additionally, the game includes two more secret characters: Seth as the game's standard final boss, and [[Gouken]] as a secret opponent, which makes for a total of 19 characters. The console version includes 6 more characters to the roster making for a total of 25, the returning characters are: [[Cammy (Street Fighter)|Cammy]], [[Dan (Street Fighter)|Dan]], [[Fei Long]], [[Gen (Street Fighter)|Gen]], [[Rose (Street Fighter)|Rose]] and [[Sakura (Street Fighter)|Sakura]].\n\nNewcomers:\n* {{Flagicon|France}} [[List of Street Fighter characters#Abel|Abel]], a French fighter who utilizes [[Full contact karate|full-contact karate]], [[Judo]] and Russian [[Sambo (martial art)|combat sambo]] to defeat opponents (note his kurtka).

Initially, there was much resistance to Ono's pitch for a new ''Street Fighter'' game so many years after the original. The gap from 2000 to 2008, since ''[[Street Fighter EX3]]'', the latest ''Street Fighter'' game at that point, represented the longest time the series had gone without a sequel. However, in light of fan demand plus the positive reception to ''[[Street Fighter II#Hyper Fighting|Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting]]'' on [[Xbox Live Arcade]], Inafune eventually allowed the project to begin.<ref name=\"EGM\">{{cite news|url=|title=The Big Comeback|last=Bettenhausen|first=Shane|date=January 2008|work=Electronic Gaming Monthly|access-date=|publisher=Ziff Davis|volume=224|pages=62\u201372}}</ref> This was Ono's first take on a new entry for the ''Street Fighter'' series as a producer, although he had previously worked on ''Street Fighter III 3rd Strike'' as a \"sound management director\" and previously produced ''[[Capcom Fighting Jam]]''. The experience provided by ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' became the main influence for the ''Street Fighter IV'' development team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/194282.html|title=GameTrailers interview with Yoshinori Ono|publisher=Gametrailers.com|accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nThe original game concept, titled ''Street Fighter IV Flashback'', imagined in part by [[David Sirlin]], the designer of ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix]]'', never made it past the proposal stage. ''Flashback'' would likewise feature the 2.5D gameplay and a roster made of classic ''Street Fighter II'' characters plus Sakura and a few new characters. The game would have also featured a single-player mode with third-person 3D action (similar to this of the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series) that focused on Ryu's backstory, as well as all ''Street Fighter'' arcade games in their original forms and a 3D version of ''Super Turbo''. ''Flashback'''s proposed easy control system was later used in ''[[Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars]]'', minus its titular \"flashback\" gameplay feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/02/17/before-street-fighter-iv-there-was-street-fighter-iv-flashback/ |title=Before Street Fighter IV There Was Street Fighter IV Flashback |publisher=Siliconera |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Street Fighter IV'' features models and backgrounds rendered in 3D, the gameplay remains on a traditional 2D plane, with the camera having freedom to move in 3D at certain times during fights, for dramatic effect, similar to the ''[[Street Fighter EX]]'' series Capcom produced with Arika. Initially the title had been developed to use 3D [[hitbox]]es, but the testers felt it did not have the \"pixel perfect\" precision of a ''Street Fighter'' game, and the game was therefore changed to use 2D hitboxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/sfiv-s-3d-polygons-could-have-ruined-hit-detection-172084.phtml|title=SFIV's 3D polygons could have ruined hit detection}}</ref> \nOno has also cited the arcade version of [[Arc System Works]]' ''[[Battle Fantasia]]'' as the inspiration for the game's three-dimensional art style.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web |title= Saving Street Fighter: Yoshi Ono on Building Street Fighter IV (Page 3)|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3791/saving_street_fighter_yoshi_ono_.php?page=3 |author= Sheffield, Brandon |date=2008-09-26 |website=Gamasutra |accessdate=2009-12-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091109161513/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3791/saving_street_fighter_yoshi_ono_.php?page=3| archivedate= 2009-11-09 | url-status= live}}</ref> Art director and character designer Daigo Ikeno, who previously worked on ''Street Fighter III 3rd Strike'',<ref name=\"artist\">{{cite web |last=Mielke |first=James |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&cId=3165156 |title=Street Fighter 4 Preview for ARC from |website=1UP.com |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2015-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021923/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?pager.offset=1&cId=3165156 |archivedate=2015-11-17}}</ref> opted for [[non-photorealistic rendering]] to give them a hand-drawn look,<ref name=\"1Up\" /> with visual effects accented in calligraphic strokes, ink smudges and ink sprays during the fights.\n\n''Street Fighter IV''{{'}}s musical score was primarily composed by [[Hideyuki Fukasawa]]. The game's music consisted of new and old material created for it. Several music pieces (such as the themes for the returning ''SFII'' characters) were rearranged for ''SFIV''. While previous ''Street Fighter'' games contained limited voice work, ''Street Fighter IV'' was the first ''Street Fighter'' series game to feature extensive voice acting. The game offers a choice between the original Japanese or an English dub.\n\nThe game runs on the [[Taito Type X#Taito Type X2|Taito Type X<sup>2</sup>]] arcade board inside a [[Taito Vewlix]] cabinet.<ref name=\"famitsuarcade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1213478_1124.html |title=\u3010\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30ea\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u305d\u306e1\u3011\u300e\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fcIV\u300f\u3042\u3044\u3064\u3089\u304c\u5e30\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f!! - Famitsu.com |publisher=Famitsu.com |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref> It takes advantage of the Type X<sup>2</sup>'s network capabilities and allows players in separate machines within the same LAN to fight each other.\n\n==Home versions==\n''Street Fighter IV'' was also released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and [[Microsoft Windows]], featuring additional playable characters and features not found in the arcade game. Capcom later released an [[iOS]] version on March 10, 2010.<ref name=\"iPhone OS preview\" /> In March 2017 the [[Xbox 360]] version of ''Street Fighter IV'' became backward compatible on the [[Xbox One]].\n\n===Additional characters===\nThe notable addition in the home versions of ''Street Fighter IV'' are eight unlockable and playable characters not available in the arcade version.
