The right main bronchus subdivides into three '''secondary bronchi''' (also known as '''lobar bronchi'''), which deliver oxygen to the three [[Human lung#lobes|lobes]] of the right lung\u2014the superior, middle and inferior lobe. The [[azygos vein]] arches over it from behind; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. About 2&nbsp;cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the right lung, which is also called the [[eparterial bronchus]].  ''Eparterial'' refers to its position above the right [[pulmonary artery]]. The right bronchus now passes below the artery, and is known as the ''hyparterial'' branch which divides into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.\n\nThe '''left main bronchus''' is smaller in caliber but longer than the [[Right main bronchus|right]], being 5&nbsp;cm long. It enters the [[root of the lung|root of the left lung]] opposite the sixth [[thoracic vertebra]]. It passes beneath the [[aortic arch]], crosses in front of the [[esophagus]], the [[thoracic duct]], and the [[descending aorta]], and has the left [[pulmonary artery]] lying at first above, and then in front of it. The left bronchus has no [[eparterial branch]], and therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the [[right lung]]. The left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung\u2014the superior and the inferior lobe.\n\nThe secondary bronchi divide further into '''tertiary bronchi''', (also known as '''segmental bronchi'''), each of which supplies a [[bronchopulmonary segment]].  A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from the rest of the lung by a [[septum]] of [[connective tissue]]. This property allows a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments. Initially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight, four for each lobe. The tertiary bronchi divide further in another three branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi which are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. These branch into many smaller [[bronchiole]]s which divide into [[terminal bronchiole]]s, each of which then gives rise to several [[respiratory bronchiole]]s, which go on to divide into two to eleven [[alveolar duct]]s. There are five or six [[alveolar sac]]s associated with each alveolar duct.  The [[pulmonary alveolus|alveolus]] is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung.\n\nThe main bronchi have relatively large [[lumen (anatomy)|lumens]] that are lined by [[respiratory epithelium]]. This cellular lining has cilia departing towards the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. There is a [[smooth muscle]] layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral in opposite directions.  This smooth muscle layer contains [[seromucous gland]]s, which secrete [[mucus]], in its wall. [[Hyaline cartilage]] is present in the bronchi, surrounding the smooth muscle layer. In the main bronchi, the cartilage forms C-shaped rings like those in the [[trachea]], while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline cartilage is present in irregularly arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands.  These plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.<ref name=\"Saladin2\">{{cite book |last1=Saladin |first1=K |title=Anatomy & physiology : the unity of form and function |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780073378251 |page=862 |edition=6th}}</ref>\n\nThe bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial diameter.<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=OlhuhvvR7z4C&pg=SA6-PA4 Section SA6-PA4 (\"Airway Inflammation with Wall Thickening\"]) in: {{cite book|title=Fundamentals of High-Resolution Lung CT: Common Findings, Common Patterns, Common Diseases, and Differential Diagnosis|author=Brett M.

[[Acute bronchitis]] is usually caused by [[virus disease|viral]] or [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infections]].  Many sufferers of [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] also suffer from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), and this is usually associated with [[smoking]] or long-term exposure to [[irritation|irritants]].\n\n===Aspiration===\nThe left main bronchus departs from the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. The right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the right lung to [[pulmonary aspiration|aspirational]] problems. If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. [[Bacterial pneumonia]] and [[aspiration pneumonia]] may result.\n\nIf a [[tracheal tube]] used for [[tracheal intubation|intubation]] is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus, allowing ventilation only of the right lung.\n\n===Asthma===\n[[Asthma]] is marked by [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness|hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi]] with an inflammatory component, often in response to [[allergen]]s.\n\nIn [[asthma]], the constriction of the bronchi can result in a difficulty in breathing giving [[shortness of breath]]; this can lead to a [[Hypoxia (medical)|lack of oxygen]] reaching the body for cellular processes. In this case an [[inhaler]] can be used to rectify the problem. The inhaler administers a [[bronchodilator]], which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand the airways. This effect occurs quite quickly.\n\n===Bronchial atresia===\n'''Bronchial atresia''' is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied appearance. A bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi, affecting one or more bronchi \u2013 usually segmental bronchi and sometimes lobar. The defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. The surrounding [[lung parenchyma|tissue]] secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended.<ref name=\"JVS\">{{cite journal|pmid=29302450|pmc=5730535|year=2017|last1=Traibi|first1=A.|title=Congenital bronchial atresia in adults: Thoracoscopic resection|journal=Journal of Visualized Surgery|volume=3|pages=174|last2=Seguin-Givelet|first2=A.|last3=Grigoroiu|first3=M.|last4=Brian|first4=E.|last5=Gossot|first5=D.|doi=10.21037/jovs.2017.10.15}}</ref> This can lead to regional emphysema.<ref name=\"Thorax\">{{cite journal|pmid=1494776|pmc=1021111|year=1992|last1=Van Klaveren|first1=R.

Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the [[capillaries]] occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. The [[alveolar ducts]] and alveoli consist primarily of simple [[squamous epithelium]], which permits rapid diffusion of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]].\n\n==Clinical significance==\n[[File:Bronchial wall thickness (T) and diameter (D).svg|thumb|100px|Bronchial wall thickness (T) and bronchial diameter (D).]]\nBronchial wall thickening, as can be seen on [[CT scan]], generally (but not always) implies [[bronchitis|inflammation of the bronchi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bronchial-wall-thickening|title=Bronchial wall thickening|author=Yuranga Weerakkody|website=[[Radiopaedia]]|accessdate=2018-01-05}}</ref> Normally, the ratio of the bronchial wall thickness and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.<ref>[https://books.google.se/books?id=97pHzCI5vE4C&pg=PA112 Page 112] in: {{cite book|title=Imaging of the Airways: Functional and Radiologic Correlations|author=David P. Naidich|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2005|isbn=9780781757683}}</ref>\n\n===Bronchitis===\n{{Main|Bronchitis}}\n[[Bronchitis]] is defined as [[inflammation]] of the bronchi,  which can either be [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] or [[chronic condition|chronic]]. [[Acute bronchitis]] is usually caused by [[virus disease|viral]] or [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infections]].  Many sufferers of [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] also suffer from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), and this is usually associated with [[smoking]] or long-term exposure to [[irritation|irritants]].\n\n===Aspiration===\nThe left main bronchus departs from the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. The right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the right lung to [[pulmonary aspiration|aspirational]] problems. If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. [[Bacterial pneumonia]] and [[aspiration pneumonia]] may result.\n\nIf a [[tracheal tube]] used for [[tracheal intubation|intubation]] is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus, allowing ventilation only of the right lung.\n\n===Asthma===\n[[Asthma]] is marked by [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness|hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi]] with an inflammatory component, often in response to [[allergen]]s.\n\nIn [[asthma]], the constriction of the bronchi can result in a difficulty in breathing giving [[shortness of breath]]; this can lead to a [[Hypoxia (medical)|lack of oxygen]] reaching the body for cellular processes. In this case an [[inhaler]] can be used to rectify the problem. The inhaler administers a [[bronchodilator]], which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand the airways. This effect occurs quite quickly.\n\n===Bronchial atresia===\n'''Bronchial atresia''' is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied appearance. A bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi, affecting one or more bronchi \u2013 usually segmental bronchi and sometimes lobar. The defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. The surrounding [[lung parenchyma|tissue]] secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended.<ref name=\"JVS\">{{cite journal|pmid=29302450|pmc=5730535|year=2017|last1=Traibi|first1=A.|title=Congenital bronchial atresia in adults: Thoracoscopic resection|journal=Journal of Visualized Surgery|volume=3|pages=174|last2=Seguin-Givelet|first2=A.|last3=Grigoroiu|first3=M.|last4=Brian|first4=E.|last5=Gossot|first5=D.|doi=10.21037/jovs.2017.10.15}}</ref> This can lead to regional emphysema.<ref name=\"Thorax\">{{cite journal|pmid=1494776|pmc=1021111|year=1992|last1=Van Klaveren|first1=R.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\").

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on'' ''the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had grown weary of his character Sherlock Holmes.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=\"BBCdustyClues\" />  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series; for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend Dolly, is still alive and well in ''Sleeping Murder'' although he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/agatha-christie/biography|title=About Agatha Christie|work=Artists|publisher=MTV|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family gave their \"full backing\" to the release of a new Poirot story, ''[[The Monogram Murders]]'', which was written by British author [[Sophie Hannah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders|title=The Monogram Murders|publisher=Agatha Christie.com|accessdate=11 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403183934/http://www.agathachristie.com/the-monogram-murders/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref> Hannah later released two more Poirot mysteries, ''[[Closed Casket (novel)|Closed Casket]]'', in 2016<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agathachristie.com/news/2016/an-interview-with-sophie-hannah|title=An interview with Sophie Hannah|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Agatha Christie#Writings|''The Mystery of the Three-Quarters'']] in 2018.\n\n====Formula and plot devices====\nEarly in Christie's career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> According to Sophie Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?'

While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a solid background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up-to-date at Torquay Hospital.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|235,470}}\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons \u2026 These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories\".<ref name=\":11\" /> There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's future: ''Murder in Mesopotamia'', ''Cards on the Table'', ''The Pale Horse'', and ''Mrs. McGinty's Dead'', among numerous others.\n\nGillian Gill also notes that the murder method in Christie's very first detective novel, ''The Mysterious Affair at Styles'', \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary.\"<ref name=\":10\" />{{Rp|34}} In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths \u2026 I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=Agatha Christie: \u2018Queen of Crime\u2019 Is a Gentlewoman|date=8 March 1970|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|url-status=live|page=60, quoted in Gerald (1993), p. 4.}}</ref> With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under [[Ronald Knox]]'s \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".<ref name=\":12\" />{{Rp|58}} Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and many other standard pharmaceuticals were utilized to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades. \n\n===Archaeology===\n{{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%|\n| source = \n| quote = The lure of the past came up to grab me.

She met her second husband, Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, on a trip to the excavation site at [[Ur]] in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dever|first=Norma|date=2004|title=They Also Dug!

Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending three to four months at a time in [[Syria]] and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, [[Nineveh]], [[Tell Arpachiyah]], [[Chagar Bazar]], [[Tell Brak]], and [[Nimrud]]. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''Murder on the Orient Express'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''.

The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''Death on the Nile''.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|212}} Similarly, throughout ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''Death on the Nile'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to Baghdad with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by David Suchet, who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie.

The apparent terrorist attack is named \"Careless Monday\", and no one takes responsibility. Three months on, university graduate Saki Morimi visits [[New York City]] and then [[Washington D.C.]] for her graduation trip. Outside the [[White House]], Saki encounters a naked Japanese man suffering from [[amnesia]]. The man, after receiving Saki's coat, follows the directions of a [[concierge]], Juiz, on his unusual [[cell phone]], to an apartment where he finds multiple [[fake passport]]s, choosing the identity of Akira Takizawa. Saki appears to retrieve her passport, and they return to Japan, where a new missile has hit.\n\nTakizawa discovers that his phone carries \u00a58.2 billion in digital money, and that he is part of a game, where twelve individuals called Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are given [[Japanese yen|\u00a510 billion]] to \"save\" Japan in some way. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are able to contact Juiz, who can fulfill their orders for a price. However, if the money is used up completely, or for selfish purposes, the individual will be eliminated by the Supporter, the anonymous \"twelfth man\" of the group. During the search for answers, Takizawa learns he was involved in Careless Monday, transporting twenty-thousand [[NEET]]s to [[Dubai]] after they helped evacuate the missiles' attacks before the attacks.\n\nHe also encounters other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, including [[National Police Agency (Japan)|police officer]] Y\u016bsei Kond\u014d, [[neurosurgeon]] Dr. Hajime Hiura, and [[serial killer]] Kuroha Diana Shiratori, who targets rapists. Saki and her friends, who run a company called Eden of the East, eventually become involved in the conspiracies surrounding Takizawa. The company's name stems from a cell phone app that can recognise and provide details on items and people via social networking.\n\nTakizawa meets Yutaka Itazu, a [[hikikomori]] and hacker, who studies Takizawa and the late Kond\u014d's phones, able to access the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o requests. They discover Takizawa did not launch the missiles, but it was orchestrated by other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Daiju Mononobe and Ry\u014d Y\u016bki. After Takizawa leaves, Itazu discovers sixty more missiles will be launched, but is run over by Mononobe before he can inform Takizawa. However, Itazu sends the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database to Eden beforehand, and recovers in hospital.\n\nMononobe approaches Takizawa, inviting him to his endgame. He explains that Mr. Outside is actually Saiz\u014d At\u014d, an elderly businessman who helped rebuild [[Post-occupation Japan|post-war Japan]]. He believes At\u014d has since died. Travelling to At\u014d's business facility, Mononobe reveals to Takizawa that Juiz is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]], housed in twelve [[supercomputer]]s. Takizawa objects to Mononobe and Y\u016bki's plan and leaves, but not before they reveal Takizawa's made himself a martyr to defend the NEETs from being accused as terrorists, erasing his memory to protect them.\n\nTakizawa reunites with Saki and Eden at his home, a [[shopping mall]] in [[Toyosu]], just as the twenty-thousand NEETs return from Dubai on a cargo ship. Takizawa draws everyone to the roof, ordering them to suggest a countermeasure for the approaching missiles. Juiz summons the [[JSDF]] to intercept the missiles. Takizawa, knowing he will be unable to pose as a terrorist, asks Juiz to make him the \"King of Japan\", erasing his memory once again, but he slips his cell phone into Saki's pocket beforehand.\n\n===''The King of Eden''===\nSix months after the events of the anime, Takizawa has disappeared, while Saki searches for his whereabouts. Juiz sends Saki a message he recorded before erasing his memory again, Takizawa instructing her to meet in their \"special place\". Following the missile strike, Eden became a successful business, and Takizawa has become a folk hero named the \"Air King\", his image marketed by Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Jintaro Tsuji, hoping to turn him into a martyr or terrorist. Eden also learns Takizawa's last name has been changed to Iinuma, the same as the recently deceased Prime Minister of Japan. Tsuji spreads rumours that Takizawa is Iinuma's illegitimate son.\n\nSaki, realizing that Takizawa's message may be alluding to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York, travels there. She discovers a gun has been smuggled into her luggage, her cab driver fleeing with Takizawa's phone in the back. Saki eventually finds Takizawa, who does not recognize her. They retrieve her purse and Takizawa's phone from the cabbie, Takizawa accepting his lost identity. Eden, who have access to the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database, learn Y\u016bki destroyed his phone, and Dr. Hiura is alive, his memory erased by the Supporter. They later discover that Mononobe has hacked their systems, forcing them to shut Eden down.\n\nTakizawa hopes to find out what became of his mother, traveling with Saki to a [[carousel]] where they find a golden ring left there by his mother. They are attacked by men working for Iinuma, and film director Taishi Naomoto, a fellow Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, but he is arrested. Kuroha aids Takizawa, informing him that he must return to Japan to confirm his illegitimacy as the Prime Minister's son. Mononobe begins targeting a series of [[truck]]s, actually housing the individual Juiz supercomputers, with missiles. He destroys the Supporter and Tsuji's trucks, while Kuroha sacrifices her own to keep Takizawa in the game. She leaves while Takizawa and Saki fly to Japan.\n\n===''Paradise Lost''===\nTakizawa and Saki arrive in Japan, meeting Iinuma's [[widow]] Chigusa, who removes several strands of Takizawa's hair for a [[DNA test]]. Takizawa is separated from Saki, asking her to track down his mother by identifying his pet dog through Eden. Takizawa later escapes his escorts by swapping places with one of the NEETs. He contacts Eden, who have retreated to the university campus, informing him of the Juiz trucks.\n\nSaki and her friend Satoshi Osugi track down Takizawa's mother, Aya, who runs a bar. She admits she lived in New York and had a fling with Iinuma, but does not confirm or deny the identity of Takizawa's father. Aya flees when Mononobe sends police to interrogate her. Takizawa tracks down his Juiz truck, meeting up with Eden members Micchon and Sis, who hijack Mononobe's truck. Eden's leader Kazuomi Hirasawa meets Saiz\u014d At\u014d, discovering he is alive and works as a cab driver, doubling also as the Supporter.\n\nTakizawa and Eden arrive at Iinuma's house, where Mononobe meets Takizawa. Mononobe asks him to retire from the game so he can win and take control of the government. Takizawa agrees as long as Mononobe becomes Prime Minister, but the latter declines. Takizawa goes ahead with his own endgame, addressing Japan using the \"Airship\" phone app, roleplaying as a terrorist but encourages society to change their country for the better. In a final act, he gives all the recipients one yen each.\n\nImpressed, At\u014d ends the game, declaring all of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o as winners. As a farewell gift, he erases their memories of the game over the phones. However, Takizawa is unaffected, immune to its effects. Mononobe leaves, running into Y\u016bki, who is unaware of what has happened, and tries to murder Mononobe for abandoning him. Mononobe crashes his car, running over Y\u016bki in the process. Takizawa checks the DNA test, discovering he is unrelated to her husband. He departs, kissing Saki and promising to meet her again. In the epilogue, Saki narrates how Eden shut down for a while to support the NEETs. In a final scene, Takizawa meets At\u014d, and they drive off to speak about future plans.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Saki Morimi}}|\u68ee\u7f8e \u54b2|Morimi Saki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Saori Hayami]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:Saki Morimi is a young woman in her last year in university.

She visits New York City as part of her graduation trip but leaves her friends to visit Washington D.C. alone. At the start of the series, she throws a coin at the [[White House]] lawn and is approached by police, but Akira Takizawa bails her out of trouble. After realizing that her passport is in the coat she gives to Akira, she follows him, and later goes back with him to Tokyo, Japan. She tries to get a job so that she does not become reliant on her sister's family, but after her interview with her brother-in-law's former company goes badly, she follows Akira on his adventures and gets her old club, \"Eden of the East\", to partner with Akira on their business venture.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Akira Takizawa}}|\u6edd\u6ca2 \u6717|Takizawa Akira}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]|[[Jason Liebrecht]]}}\n:A young man who lost his memory because of a brainwashing program, Akira Takizawa meets Saki Morimi in Washington D.C., appearing naked and only carrying a handgun and an extremely advanced cell phone with the phrase ''\"noblesse oblige\"'' printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit.  When Saki is questioned by police after she throws a coin in the grounds of the [[White House]], he helps her out and she gives him her coat to thank him.  When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be \"Juiz\" answers. She sends him a map that marks an apartment building where he is apparently staying. In his apartment, he finds guns and many different passports which seem to all belong to him. Saki follows after realizing she left her passport in the coat she gave him and the two decide to return to Japan together.

According to him, Japan is in a state of apathy caused by the economic prosperity it has obtained since the end of [[World War II]], and the strong political influence from countries like the United States into their society, thus he plans to \"save\" the country by rallying the population with a wide scale terrorist attack.<ref name=\"ep10\"/> However, Akira and the NEETs recruited by him managed to foil his plans, first with Careless Monday, and then by countering the missiles at the end of the regular TV series.<ref name = \"ep11\">''Eden of the East'', episode 11</ref> In the ''King of Eden'' movie, he uses the Japanese police Public Security Dept to investigate the Eden of the East group, which has been involved with Akira Takizawa's activities.

In ''Paradise Lost'', he reveals that he plans to overthrow the current government and install a more powerful one at the cost of individual freedom.

When a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed from the game, their trailer is scrapped, or alternately, a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed if their trailer is destroyed. Judging by the differing reactions of the various Juizes, the AIs appear to be independent entities, but initialized from the same generative code base. In episode 10, a woman appears at ATO headquarters with the same voice and manner of speech as Juiz; this serves to cast doubt on whether she is actually Juiz or whether her voice and personality (if not her memories) simply were used as the model for developing Juiz.

The apparent terrorist attack is named \"Careless Monday\", and no one takes responsibility. Three months on, university graduate Saki Morimi visits [[New York City]] and then [[Washington D.C.]] for her graduation trip. Outside the [[White House]], Saki encounters a naked Japanese man suffering from [[amnesia]]. The man, after receiving Saki's coat, follows the directions of a [[concierge]], Juiz, on his unusual [[cell phone]], to an apartment where he finds multiple [[fake passport]]s, choosing the identity of Akira Takizawa. Saki appears to retrieve her passport, and they return to Japan, where a new missile has hit.\n\nTakizawa discovers that his phone carries \u00a58.2 billion in digital money, and that he is part of a game, where twelve individuals called Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are given [[Japanese yen|\u00a510 billion]] to \"save\" Japan in some way. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are able to contact Juiz, who can fulfill their orders for a price. However, if the money is used up completely, or for selfish purposes, the individual will be eliminated by the Supporter, the anonymous \"twelfth man\" of the group. During the search for answers, Takizawa learns he was involved in Careless Monday, transporting twenty-thousand [[NEET]]s to [[Dubai]] after they helped evacuate the missiles' attacks before the attacks.\n\nHe also encounters other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, including [[National Police Agency (Japan)|police officer]] Y\u016bsei Kond\u014d, [[neurosurgeon]] Dr. Hajime Hiura, and [[serial killer]] Kuroha Diana Shiratori, who targets rapists. Saki and her friends, who run a company called Eden of the East, eventually become involved in the conspiracies surrounding Takizawa. The company's name stems from a cell phone app that can recognise and provide details on items and people via social networking.\n\nTakizawa meets Yutaka Itazu, a [[hikikomori]] and hacker, who studies Takizawa and the late Kond\u014d's phones, able to access the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o requests. They discover Takizawa did not launch the missiles, but it was orchestrated by other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Daiju Mononobe and Ry\u014d Y\u016bki. After Takizawa leaves, Itazu discovers sixty more missiles will be launched, but is run over by Mononobe before he can inform Takizawa. However, Itazu sends the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database to Eden beforehand, and recovers in hospital.\n\nMononobe approaches Takizawa, inviting him to his endgame. He explains that Mr. Outside is actually Saiz\u014d At\u014d, an elderly businessman who helped rebuild [[Post-occupation Japan|post-war Japan]]. He believes At\u014d has since died. Travelling to At\u014d's business facility, Mononobe reveals to Takizawa that Juiz is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]], housed in twelve [[supercomputer]]s. Takizawa objects to Mononobe and Y\u016bki's plan and leaves, but not before they reveal Takizawa's made himself a martyr to defend the NEETs from being accused as terrorists, erasing his memory to protect them.\n\nTakizawa reunites with Saki and Eden at his home, a [[shopping mall]] in [[Toyosu]], just as the twenty-thousand NEETs return from Dubai on a cargo ship. Takizawa draws everyone to the roof, ordering them to suggest a countermeasure for the approaching missiles. Juiz summons the [[JSDF]] to intercept the missiles. Takizawa, knowing he will be unable to pose as a terrorist, asks Juiz to make him the \"King of Japan\", erasing his memory once again, but he slips his cell phone into Saki's pocket beforehand.\n\n===''The King of Eden''===\nSix months after the events of the anime, Takizawa has disappeared, while Saki searches for his whereabouts. Juiz sends Saki a message he recorded before erasing his memory again, Takizawa instructing her to meet in their \"special place\". Following the missile strike, Eden became a successful business, and Takizawa has become a folk hero named the \"Air King\", his image marketed by Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, Jintaro Tsuji, hoping to turn him into a martyr or terrorist. Eden also learns Takizawa's last name has been changed to Iinuma, the same as the recently deceased Prime Minister of Japan. Tsuji spreads rumours that Takizawa is Iinuma's illegitimate son.\n\nSaki, realizing that Takizawa's message may be alluding to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York, travels there. She discovers a gun has been smuggled into her luggage, her cab driver fleeing with Takizawa's phone in the back. Saki eventually finds Takizawa, who does not recognize her. They retrieve her purse and Takizawa's phone from the cabbie, Takizawa accepting his lost identity. Eden, who have access to the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o database, learn Y\u016bki destroyed his phone, and Dr. Hiura is alive, his memory erased by the Supporter. They later discover that Mononobe has hacked their systems, forcing them to shut Eden down.\n\nTakizawa hopes to find out what became of his mother, traveling with Saki to a [[carousel]] where they find a golden ring left there by his mother. They are attacked by men working for Iinuma, and film director Taishi Naomoto, a fellow Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, but he is arrested. Kuroha aids Takizawa, informing him that he must return to Japan to confirm his illegitimacy as the Prime Minister's son. Mononobe begins targeting a series of [[truck]]s, actually housing the individual Juiz supercomputers, with missiles. He destroys the Supporter and Tsuji's trucks, while Kuroha sacrifices her own to keep Takizawa in the game. She leaves while Takizawa and Saki fly to Japan.\n\n===''Paradise Lost''===\nTakizawa and Saki arrive in Japan, meeting Iinuma's [[widow]] Chigusa, who removes several strands of Takizawa's hair for a [[DNA test]]. Takizawa is separated from Saki, asking her to track down his mother by identifying his pet dog through Eden. Takizawa later escapes his escorts by swapping places with one of the NEETs. He contacts Eden, who have retreated to the university campus, informing him of the Juiz trucks.\n\nSaki and her friend Satoshi Osugi track down Takizawa's mother, Aya, who runs a bar. She admits she lived in New York and had a fling with Iinuma, but does not confirm or deny the identity of Takizawa's father. Aya flees when Mononobe sends police to interrogate her. Takizawa tracks down his Juiz truck, meeting up with Eden members Micchon and Sis, who hijack Mononobe's truck. Eden's leader Kazuomi Hirasawa meets Saiz\u014d At\u014d, discovering he is alive and works as a cab driver, doubling also as the Supporter.\n\nTakizawa and Eden arrive at Iinuma's house, where Mononobe meets Takizawa. Mononobe asks him to retire from the game so he can win and take control of the government. Takizawa agrees as long as Mononobe becomes Prime Minister, but the latter declines. Takizawa goes ahead with his own endgame, addressing Japan using the \"Airship\" phone app, roleplaying as a terrorist but encourages society to change their country for the better. In a final act, he gives all the recipients one yen each.\n\nImpressed, At\u014d ends the game, declaring all of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o as winners. As a farewell gift, he erases their memories of the game over the phones. However, Takizawa is unaffected, immune to its effects. Mononobe leaves, running into Y\u016bki, who is unaware of what has happened, and tries to murder Mononobe for abandoning him. Mononobe crashes his car, running over Y\u016bki in the process. Takizawa checks the DNA test, discovering he is unrelated to her husband. He departs, kissing Saki and promising to meet her again. In the epilogue, Saki narrates how Eden shut down for a while to support the NEETs. In a final scene, Takizawa meets At\u014d, and they drive off to speak about future plans.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Saki Morimi}}|\u68ee\u7f8e \u54b2|Morimi Saki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Saori Hayami]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:Saki Morimi is a young woman in her last year in university. After her parents died, she has been living with her married elder sister and her family, who have been supporting her through college. She visits New York City as part of her graduation trip but leaves her friends to visit Washington D.C. alone. At the start of the series, she throws a coin at the [[White House]] lawn and is approached by police, but Akira Takizawa bails her out of trouble. After realizing that her passport is in the coat she gives to Akira, she follows him, and later goes back with him to Tokyo, Japan. She tries to get a job so that she does not become reliant on her sister's family, but after her interview with her brother-in-law's former company goes badly, she follows Akira on his adventures and gets her old club, \"Eden of the East\", to partner with Akira on their business venture.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Akira Takizawa}}|\u6edd\u6ca2 \u6717|Takizawa Akira}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Ry\u014dhei Kimura]]|[[Jason Liebrecht]]}}\n:A young man who lost his memory because of a brainwashing program, Akira Takizawa meets Saki Morimi in Washington D.C., appearing naked and only carrying a handgun and an extremely advanced cell phone with the phrase ''\"noblesse oblige\"'' printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit.  When Saki is questioned by police after she throws a coin in the grounds of the [[White House]], he helps her out and she gives him her coat to thank him.  When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be \"Juiz\" answers. She sends him a map that marks an apartment building where he is apparently staying. In his apartment, he finds guns and many different passports which seem to all belong to him. Saki follows after realizing she left her passport in the coat she gave him and the two decide to return to Japan together. His real name and DOB are unknown; his current identity as Akira Takizawa was chosen from the passports he found, which lists that in [[Toyosu]], Japan and that he was born on January 7, 1989, one day younger than Saki Morimi.\n<!--\nDo not split off, characters not notable enough for own sections\n-->\n\n===Eden of the East club===\nThe Eden of the East club started out as a small recycling group, but has quickly turned into a springboard for a successful commercial website, thanks to Micchon's revolutionary image recognition engine that resides in the ''Eden'' website and Saki's ability to improve the value of any item, including junk. Soon, the site's ability to work on phones attracted many student subscribers.

He brings Akira to the ATO headquarters and reveals more information about his past with the hopes of recruiting him to his side. His ambition is not only to win the game, but to replace Mr. Outside himself as he assumes Mr. Outside is dead. According to him, Japan is in a state of apathy caused by the economic prosperity it has obtained since the end of [[World War II]], and the strong political influence from countries like the United States into their society, thus he plans to \"save\" the country by rallying the population with a wide scale terrorist attack.<ref name=\"ep10\"/> However, Akira and the NEETs recruited by him managed to foil his plans, first with Careless Monday, and then by countering the missiles at the end of the regular TV series.<ref name = \"ep11\">''Eden of the East'', episode 11</ref> In the ''King of Eden'' movie, he uses the Japanese police Public Security Dept to investigate the Eden of the East group, which has been involved with Akira Takizawa's activities.

In ''Paradise Lost'', he reveals that he plans to overthrow the current government and install a more powerful one at the cost of individual freedom.

When a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed from the game, their trailer is scrapped, or alternately, a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is removed if their trailer is destroyed. Judging by the differing reactions of the various Juizes, the AIs appear to be independent entities, but initialized from the same generative code base.

Ref BFI as British. Do not change. --> [[List of historical drama films|historical drama]] film directed by [[Morten Tyldum]] and written by [[Graham Moore (writer)|Graham Moore]], based on the biography ''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'' by [[Andrew Hodges]]. It stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as British [[cryptanalyst]] [[Alan Turing]], who decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during the [[Second World War]]. [[Keira Knightley]], [[Matthew Goode]], [[Rory Kinnear]], [[Charles Dance]], and [[Mark Strong]] also star.\n\nThe screenplay topped the annual [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] for best unproduced [[Hollywood]] scripts in 2011. [[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for U.S. distribution rights at the [[European Film Market]]. It was released theatrically in the United States on 28 November 2014.\n\n''The Imitation Game'' grossed over $233 million worldwide on a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It received eight nominations at the [[87th Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], five nominations in the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]], and three nominations at the [[21st Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. It also received nine [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the [[39th Toronto International Film Festival]].\n\nThe film was criticised by some for its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and for downplaying Turing's homosexuality. However, the [[LGBT]] civil rights advocacy organisation the [[Human Rights Campaign]] honoured it for bringing Turing's legacy to a wider audience.\n\u9673\u4ead\u6f22\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\nIn 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in [[cryptography]]. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.\n\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], he joins the cryptography team of [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], [[John Cairncross]], [[Peter Hilton]], Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|trying to analyze]] the [[Enigma machine]], which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\n\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design [[Bombe|a machine]] to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. [[Joan Clarke]], a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.\n\nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.\n\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the MI6 agent [[Stewart Menzies]] appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her [[cryptography]] skills.  Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she'll undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions.  After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.\n\nIn the 1950s, Turing is convicted of [[gross indecency]] and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes [[chemical castration]] so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.\n\nThe final scene shows an on screen message saying, \"After a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. He was 41 years old. Between 1885 and 1967, approximately 49,000 homosexual men were convicted of gross indecency under British law. In 2013, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] granted Turing a posthumous Royal Pardon, honouring his unprecedented achievements.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Alan Turing]]\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Joan Clarke]]\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]]\n* [[Rory Kinnear]] as Detective Robert Nock\n* [[Allen Leech]] as [[John Cairncross]]\n* [[Matthew Beard (British actor)|Matthew Beard]] as [[Peter Hilton]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as [[Alastair Denniston|Commander Denniston]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[Stewart Menzies]]\n* [[James Northcote (actor)|James Northcote]] as [[I.

Rejewski designed a machine in 1938, called [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']], which had broken an earlier version of Germany's Enigma machines by the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]] before the Second World War.<ref name=\"harv\">{{cite book|last=Kozaczuk |first=W\u0142adys\u0142aw |authorlink=W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kozaczuk |title=Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Kasparek |editor1-link=Christopher Kasparek |location=Frederick, MD |publisher=University Publications of America |year=1984 |isbn=0-89093-547-5 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5hJnAAAAMAAJ}}|ref=harv}}</ref> \n*: A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing in 1940 with a major contribution from mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], who goes unmentioned in the film, his contribution instead attributed to [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]].<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/> \n* The building of only one machine, with Turing playing a large role in its construction.\n*:More than 200 British Bombes were built under the supervision of chief engineer [[Harold Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]]. None of them were built at Bletchley Park.<ref name=\"haigh\"/>\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 250 | footer = Turing's rebuilt [[bombe]] machine, called Christopher in the film, on display at Bletchley Park Museum | image1 = Bomba turninga1.jpg | image2 = Bomba turninga2.jpg }}\n* The overall plot arc in which the British cryptographers were stymied for the first few years of the war and then a sudden breakthrough enabled them to finally break Enigma.\n*: In reality, the Polish cryptanalysts [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] from the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]] had been breaking German Enigma messages since 1932. Their effort allowed the Poles to build replicas of German machines in Warsaw for the Polish secret service. Just before the war, the Polish secret service revealed their work to their French and British allies in a secret meeting on 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''. Cryptologia. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia PA 30.2006,4, p.&nbsp;294.</ref> in [[Pyry (neighborhood)|Pyry]] near [[Warsaw]]. Thousands of men and women were working on the project by the time the war ended in 1945. The computing advances did not obviate the need for human labour, as the many teams of largely female operators certainly knew. Throughout the war, there were breakthroughs and setbacks when the design or use of the German Enigma machines was changed and the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"haigh\"/>{{pb}}Moreover, the breakthrough depicted in the film gives the impression that the ''Bombe'' was developed first, and only became effective later, after it was realised that deciphering could be made easier by looking for known or speculated items contained in an intercepted message, a practice known in cryptanalysis as employing a ''[[known-plaintext attack|crib]]''. In reality, the opposite was true: the use of cribs was the central [[attack model]] upon which the Bombe's principal design was based, rather than being an afterthought to the design.\n* The suggestion that Enigma was the only German cipher broken at Bletchley Park.\n*: The breaking of the [[Lorenz cipher]], codenamed \"Tunny\", arguably made just as important a contribution to Ultra intelligence as the breaking of Enigma, and breaking Tunny was in many ways more difficult. Neither the Tunny effort nor its main contributors, mathematician [[W. T. Tutte|W. T. \"Bill\" Tutte]] and electrical engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], are mentioned in the film. The [[Colossus computer]] they built goes unmentioned by name in the film, although there is an implicit suggestion that Turing was responsible for it, which he was not.<ref name=\"haigh\"/>\n* The scene where the [[Hut 8]] team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers ([[Peter Hilton]]) is serving on, to hide the fact they have broken the code.\n*: In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and decisions about [[Ultra#Safeguarding of sources|when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence]] were made at much higher administrative levels.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The sequence in which Turing writes a letter to Churchill to gain control over the project and obtain funding for the decryption machine.\n*: Turing was actually not alone in making a different request with a number of colleagues, including Hugh Alexander, writing a letter to Churchill (who had earlier visited there) in an effort to have more administrative resources sent to Bletchley Park, which Churchill immediately did.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper.\n*: In reality, [[Joan Clarke]] was recruited by her former academic supervisor, [[Gordon Welchman]], to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)]].<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>  Puzzles were used by Bletchley Park in recruitment but neither Turing nor Clarke were ever involved with them.<ref name=\"guard-puzzle\"/>\n\n===Turing's personality and personal life===\n* The presentation of Turing's social difficulties as so severe as to suggest [[Asperger syndrome]] or some form of [[autism spectrum|autism]].\n:: While a few writers and researchers have tried to assign [[Retrospective diagnoses of autism|such a retrospective diagnosis]] to Turing,<ref>{{cite journal | last=O'Connell | first=H. | last2=Fitzgerald | first2=M. | date=2003 | title= Did Alan Turing have Asperger's syndrome? | journal=Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume=20 | number=1 | pages=28\u201331}}</ref> and it is true that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film \u2013 social awkwardness, difficulty working co-operatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally \u2013 bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.

The detective in the film and the interview as portrayed are fictional. Turing was investigated for his homosexuality after a robbery at his house and was never investigated for espionage.<ref name=\"g-avt\"/>\n* The suggestion that [[chemical castration]] made Turing unable to think clearly or do any work.\n*: Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including [[gynaecomastia]], at that time he was doing innovative work on [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration. While the physical changes distressed Turing, his friends did not notice any meaningful changes to his disposition or comportment in the period between the beginning of his castration and his death.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The scene in which Clarke visits Turing in his home while he is serving probation.\n*: There is no record of Clarke ever visiting Turing's residence during his probation, although Turing did stay in touch with her after the war and informed her of his forthcoming trial for indecency.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The statement that Turing committed suicide after a year of hormone treatment.\n*: In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended 14 months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from ''[[Snow White]]'', Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However, [[Jack Copeland]], an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | first=Roland | last=Pease | publisher=BBC News | date=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Personalities and actions of other characters===\n* The depiction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston|Denniston]] as a rigid officer, bound by military thinking and eager to shut down the decryption machine when it fails to deliver results.\n*: Denniston's grandchildren stated that the film takes an \"unwarranted sideswipe\" at their grandfather's memory, showing him to be a \"baddy\" and a \"hectoring character\" who hinders the work of Turing. They said their grandfather had a completely different temperament from the one portrayed in the film and was entirely supportive of the work done by cryptographers under his command.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bletchley Park commander not the 'baddy' he is in The Imitation Game, family say|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11256888/Bletchley-Park-commander-not-the-baddy-he-is-in-The-Imitation-Game-family-say.html|newspaper=The Telegraph | location=London|first=Hannah|last=Furness|date=26 November 2014}}</ref> There is no record of the film's depicted interactions between Turing and Denniston.

Ref BFI as British. Do not change. --> [[List of historical drama films|historical drama]] film directed by [[Morten Tyldum]] and written by [[Graham Moore (writer)|Graham Moore]], based on the biography ''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'' by [[Andrew Hodges]]. It stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as British [[cryptanalyst]] [[Alan Turing]], who decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during the [[Second World War]]. [[Keira Knightley]], [[Matthew Goode]], [[Rory Kinnear]], [[Charles Dance]], and [[Mark Strong]] also star.\n\nThe screenplay topped the annual [[Black List (survey)|Black List]] for best unproduced [[Hollywood]] scripts in 2011. [[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for U.S. distribution rights at the [[European Film Market]]. It was released theatrically in the United States on 28 November 2014.\n\n''The Imitation Game'' grossed over $233 million worldwide on a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It received eight nominations at the [[87th Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], five nominations in the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]], and three nominations at the [[21st Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. It also received nine [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the [[39th Toronto International Film Festival]].\n\nThe film was criticised by some for its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and for downplaying Turing's homosexuality. However, the [[LGBT]] civil rights advocacy organisation the [[Human Rights Campaign]] honoured it for bringing Turing's legacy to a wider audience.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\nIn 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in [[cryptography]]. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.\n\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], he joins the cryptography team of [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], [[John Cairncross]], [[Peter Hilton]], Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|trying to analyze]] the [[Enigma machine]], which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\n\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design [[Bombe|a machine]] to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. [[Joan Clarke]], a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.\n\nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.\n\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the MI6 agent [[Stewart Menzies]] appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her [[cryptography]] skills.  Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she'll undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions.  After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.\n\nIn the 1950s, Turing is convicted of [[gross indecency]] and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes [[chemical castration]] so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.\n\nThe final scene shows an on screen message saying, \"After a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing committed suicide on June 7th, 1954. He was 41 years old. Between 1885 and 1967, approximately 49,000 homosexual men were convicted of gross indecency under British law. In 2013, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] granted Turing a posthumous Royal Pardon, honouring his unprecedented achievements.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Alan Turing]]\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Joan Clarke]]\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]]\n* [[Rory Kinnear]] as Detective Robert Nock\n* [[Allen Leech]] as [[John Cairncross]]\n* [[Matthew Beard (British actor)|Matthew Beard]] as [[Peter Hilton]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as [[Alastair Denniston|Commander Denniston]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[Stewart Menzies]]\n* [[James Northcote (actor)|James Northcote]] as [[I.

It was a British [[Bombe]] machine, which was partly inspired by a design by the Polish cryptanalyst [[Marian Rejewski]]. Rejewski designed a machine in 1938, called [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']], which had broken an earlier version of Germany's Enigma machines by the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]] before the Second World War.<ref name=\"harv\">{{cite book|last=Kozaczuk |first=W\u0142adys\u0142aw |authorlink=W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kozaczuk |title=Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Kasparek |editor1-link=Christopher Kasparek |location=Frederick, MD |publisher=University Publications of America |year=1984 |isbn=0-89093-547-5 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5hJnAAAAMAAJ}}|ref=harv}}</ref> \n*: A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing in 1940 with a major contribution from mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], who goes unmentioned in the film, his contribution instead attributed to [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]].<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/> \n* The building of only one machine, with Turing playing a large role in its construction.\n*:More than 200 British Bombes were built under the supervision of chief engineer [[Harold Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]].

Their effort allowed the Poles to build replicas of German machines in Warsaw for the Polish secret service. Just before the war, the Polish secret service revealed their work to their French and British allies in a secret meeting on 26 and 27 July 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

Thousands of men and women were working on the project by the time the war ended in 1945. The computing advances did not obviate the need for human labour, as the many teams of largely female operators certainly knew. Throughout the war, there were breakthroughs and setbacks when the design or use of the German Enigma machines was changed and the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"haigh\"/>{{pb}}Moreover, the breakthrough depicted in the film gives the impression that the ''Bombe'' was developed first, and only became effective later, after it was realised that deciphering could be made easier by looking for known or speculated items contained in an intercepted message, a practice known in cryptanalysis as employing a ''[[known-plaintext attack|crib]]''. In reality, the opposite was true: the use of cribs was the central [[attack model]] upon which the Bombe's principal design was based, rather than being an afterthought to the design.\n* The suggestion that Enigma was the only German cipher broken at Bletchley Park.\n*: The breaking of the [[Lorenz cipher]], codenamed \"Tunny\", arguably made just as important a contribution to Ultra intelligence as the breaking of Enigma, and breaking Tunny was in many ways more difficult. Neither the Tunny effort nor its main contributors, mathematician [[W. T. Tutte|W. T. \"Bill\" Tutte]] and electrical engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], are mentioned in the film. The [[Colossus computer]] they built goes unmentioned by name in the film, although there is an implicit suggestion that Turing was responsible for it, which he was not.<ref name=\"haigh\"/>\n* The scene where the [[Hut 8]] team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers ([[Peter Hilton]]) is serving on, to hide the fact they have broken the code.\n*: In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and decisions about [[Ultra#Safeguarding of sources|when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence]] were made at much higher administrative levels.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The sequence in which Turing writes a letter to Churchill to gain control over the project and obtain funding for the decryption machine.\n*: Turing was actually not alone in making a different request with a number of colleagues, including Hugh Alexander, writing a letter to Churchill (who had earlier visited there) in an effort to have more administrative resources sent to Bletchley Park, which Churchill immediately did.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper.\n*: In reality, [[Joan Clarke]] was recruited by her former academic supervisor, [[Gordon Welchman]], to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)]].<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>  Puzzles were used by Bletchley Park in recruitment but neither Turing nor Clarke were ever involved with them.<ref name=\"guard-puzzle\"/>\n\n===Turing's personality and personal life===\n* The presentation of Turing's social difficulties as so severe as to suggest [[Asperger syndrome]] or some form of [[autism spectrum|autism]].\n:: While a few writers and researchers have tried to assign [[Retrospective diagnoses of autism|such a retrospective diagnosis]] to Turing,<ref>{{cite journal | last=O'Connell | first=H. | last2=Fitzgerald | first2=M. | date=2003 | title= Did Alan Turing have Asperger's syndrome? | journal=Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume=20 | number=1 | pages=28\u201331}}</ref> and it is true that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film \u2013 social awkwardness, difficulty working co-operatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally \u2013 bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing.

The detective in the film and the interview as portrayed are fictional. Turing was investigated for his homosexuality after a robbery at his house and was never investigated for espionage.<ref name=\"g-avt\"/>\n* The suggestion that [[chemical castration]] made Turing unable to think clearly or do any work.\n*: Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including [[gynaecomastia]], at that time he was doing innovative work on [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration. While the physical changes distressed Turing, his friends did not notice any meaningful changes to his disposition or comportment in the period between the beginning of his castration and his death.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The scene in which Clarke visits Turing in his home while he is serving probation.\n*: There is no record of Clarke ever visiting Turing's residence during his probation, although Turing did stay in touch with her after the war and informed her of his forthcoming trial for indecency.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The statement that Turing committed suicide after a year of hormone treatment.\n*: In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended 14 months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from ''[[Snow White]]'', Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However, [[Jack Copeland]], an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | first=Roland | last=Pease | publisher=BBC News | date=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Personalities and actions of other characters===\n* The depiction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston|Denniston]] as a rigid officer, bound by military thinking and eager to shut down the decryption machine when it fails to deliver results.\n*: Denniston's grandchildren stated that the film takes an \"unwarranted sideswipe\" at their grandfather's memory, showing him to be a \"baddy\" and a \"hectoring character\" who hinders the work of Turing. They said their grandfather had a completely different temperament from the one portrayed in the film and was entirely supportive of the work done by cryptographers under his command.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bletchley Park commander not the 'baddy' he is in The Imitation Game, family say|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11256888/Bletchley-Park-commander-not-the-baddy-he-is-in-The-Imitation-Game-family-say.html|newspaper=The Telegraph | location=London|first=Hannah|last=Furness|date=26 November 2014}}</ref> There is no record of the film's depicted interactions between Turing and Denniston.
