The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nComputer networking may be considered a branch of [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n\nA computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, [[online chat]], telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. [[Distributed computing]] uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n\nA computer network may be used by [[security hacker]]s to deploy [[computer virus]]es or [[computer worm]]s on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [[denial-of-service attack]].\n\n== Network packet ==\n{{Main|Network packet}}\nComputer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [[Point-to-point link|point-to-point telecommunication links]], simply transmit data as a [[bit stream]]. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in ''packets''. A network packet is a formatted unit of [[data]] (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [[packet-switched network]]. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. A longer message is packetized before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are then reassembled back into their original message.\n\nPackets consist of two kinds of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination [[network address]]es, [[error detection]] codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [[Header (computing)|packet headers]] and [[Trailer (computing)|trailers]], with [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] in between.\n\nWith packets, the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [[circuit switching|circuit switched]]. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is [[message queue|queued]] and waits until a link is free.\n\n== Network topology ==\n[[File:NetworkTopologies.svg|thumb|right|Common network topologies]]\n{{Main|Network topology}}\n\nThe physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n\nNetwork topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n\nCommon layouts are:\n* A [[bus network]]: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [[Ethernet]], called [[10BASE5]] and [[10BASE2]]. This is still a common topology on the [[data link layer]], although modern [[physical layer]] variants use [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links instead.\n* A [[star network]]: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [[Wireless LAN]], where each wireless client connects to the central [[Wireless access point]].\n* A [[ring network]]: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) made use of such a topology.\n* A [[mesh network]]: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n* A [[fully connected network]]: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n* A [[tree network]]: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\n\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [[FDDI]], the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n=== Overlay network ===\n[[File:Network Overlay merged.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sample overlay network]]\nAn [[overlay network]] is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [[peer-to-peer]] networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<ref name=over>{{citation |author1=D. Andersen |author2=H. Balakrishnan |author3=M. Kaashoek |author4-link=Robert Tappan Morris |author4=R.

The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [[telephone network]].<ref name=over /> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [[Address Resolution Protocol|Address resolution]] and [[routing]] are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n\nAnother example of an overlay network is a [[distributed hash table]], which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [[associative array|map]]) indexed by keys.\n\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [[quality of service]] guarantees to achieve higher-quality [[streaming media]]. Previous proposals such as [[IntServ]], [[DiffServ]], and [[IP Multicast]] have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [[Router (computing)|routers]] in the network.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [[Internet service provider]]s.  The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n\nFor example, [[Akamai Technologies]] manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [[multicast]]).  Academic research includes end system multicast,<ref>{{cite web |title= End System Multicast |work= project web site |url= http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ |publisher= Carnegie Mellon University |accessdate= May 25, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050221110350/http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ |archivedate= February 21, 2005 }}</ref> resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.\n\n== Network links ==\n{{further|Data transmission}}\nThe transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the ''[[Transmission medium|physical medium]]'') used to link devices to form a computer network include [[electrical cable]], [[optical fiber]], and [[radio waves]]. In the [[OSI model]], these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \u2014 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n\nA widely adopted ''family'' of transmission media used in [[local area network]] (LAN) technology is collectively known as [[Ethernet]]. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  [[Wireless LAN]] standards use radio waves, others use [[IrDA|infrared]] signals as a transmission medium. [[Power line communication]] uses a building's [[power cabling]] to transmit data.\n\n=== Wired technologies ===\n[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Bundle of glass threads with light emitting from the ends|[[Fiber optic cables]] are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another]]\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\n*''[[Coaxial cable]]'' is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.{{citation needed|reason=Coax is fundamentally capable of more than this. This must refer to a specific [[Ethernet over coax]] standard, but that's covered in the point below.|date=September 2018}}\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] technology uses existing [[home wiring]] ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cable]], phone lines and [[Power line communication|power lines]]) to create a high-speed local area network.\n*''[[Twisted pair]]'' cabling is used for wired [[Ethernet]] and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic induction]]. The transmission speed ranges from 2&nbsp;Mbit/s to 10&nbsp;Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several [[category cable|category ratings]], designed for use in various scenarios.\n\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|alt=World map with red and blue lines|2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world.]]\n*An ''[[optical fiber]]'' is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and [[Optical amplifier|optical amplifiers]]. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|wave division multiplexing]], optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [[undersea cables]] to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, [[single-mode optical fiber]] (SMF) and [[multi-mode optical fiber]] (MMF).  Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\">{{Cite book |title=CompTIA Network+ exam guide : (exam N10-005) |last=Meyers |first=Mike |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780071789226 |edition=5th |location=New York |oclc=748332969}}</ref>\n\n=== Wireless technologies ===\n[[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black laptop with router in the background |Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links]]\n{{Main|Wireless network}}\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n*''Terrestrial [[microwave]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} apart.\n*''[[Communications satellite]]s''&nbsp;\u2013 Satellites communicate also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit {{convert|35,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n*''[[Cellular network]]s'' use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power [[transceiver]].\n*''Radio and [[spread spectrum]] technologies''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Wireless LAN]]s use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [[IEEE 802.11]] defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [[Wi-Fi]].\n*''[[Free-space optical communication]]'' uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [[line-of-sight propagation]] is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n\n=== Exotic technologies ===\nThere have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media.\n* [[IP over Avian Carriers]] was a humorous April fool's [[Request for Comments]], issued as {{IETF RFC|1149}}. It was implemented in real life in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149 |title=Bergen Linux User Group's CPIP Implementation |publisher=Blug.linux.no |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref>\n* Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the [[Interplanetary Internet]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113053223/http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |title=Interplanetary Internet |publisher=Third Annual International Symposium on Advanced Radio Technologies |author=A. Hooke |date=September 2000 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\nBoth cases have a large [[round-trip delay time]], which gives slow two-way communication but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information.\n\n== Network nodes ==\n{{Main|Node (networking)}}\nApart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic [[Systems engineering|system]] building blocks, such as [[network interface controller]]s (NICs), [[repeater]]s, [[Ethernet hub|hubs]], [[Network bridge|bridges]], [[Network switch|switches]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[modem]]s, and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n=== Network interfaces ===\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.]]\nA [[network interface controller]] (NIC) is [[computer hardware]] that connects the computer to the [[network media]] and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n\nIn [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]]\u2014usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Repeaters and hubs ===\nA [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].\n\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an [[Ethernet hub]]. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern [[network switch]]s.\n\n=== Bridges ===\nA [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\nBridges come in three basic types:\n*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs\n*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.\n*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.\n\n=== Switches ===\nA [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html\n|title=Define switch.\n|website=webopedia\n|accessdate=April 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Mitchell |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |title=bridge \u2013 network bridges |website=About.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214940/http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |archive-date=2008-03-28}}</ref> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n\n=== Routers ===\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]\nA [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a \"null\" interface, also known as the \"black hole\" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n\n=== Modems ===\n[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.\n\n== Communication protocols ==\n[[File:Internet layering.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Protocols in relation to the Internet layering scheme.|The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it.]]\n[[File:Message flows and Routing.svg|250px|thumb|alt=When a router is present, message flows go down through protocol layers, across to the router, up the stack inside the router and back down again and is sent on to the final destination where it climbs back up the stack|Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.]]\nA [[communication protocol]] is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a [[protocol stack]] (also see the [[OSI model]]), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is [[HTTP]] (the World Wide Web protocol) running over [[transmission control protocol|TCP]] over [[Internet protocol|IP]] (the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]]) over [[IEEE 802.11]] (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [[wireless router]] and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\n\nCommunication protocols have various characteristics.  They may be [[Connection-oriented communication|connection-oriented]] or [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]], they may use [[circuit mode]] or [[packet switching]], and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\n\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\n\n=== IEEE 802 ===\n[[IEEE 802]] is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [[OSI model]].\n\nFor example, [[Media access control|MAC]] [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [[Spanning Tree Protocol]]. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] describes [[Virtual LAN|VLANs]], and [[IEEE 802.1X]] defines a port-based [[Network Access Control]] protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs)&nbsp;\u2013 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n==== Ethernet ====\n[[Ethernet]], sometimes simply called ''LAN'', is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called [[IEEE 802.3]] published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].\n\n==== Wireless LAN ====\n[[Wireless LAN]], also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the [[IEEE 802]] protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by [[IEEE 802.11]] and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Suite ===\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the [[Internet protocol]] (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.\n\n=== SONET/SDH ===\n[[Synchronous optical networking]] (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [[multiplexing]] protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] voice encoded in [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) frames.\n\n=== Asynchronous Transfer Mode ===\n[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]] and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]]. This differs from other protocols such as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM has similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] and [[Packet switching|packet]] switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nWhile the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [[Next generation network|next-generation networks]], it still plays a role in the [[last mile]], which is the connection between an [[Internet service provider]] and the home user.<ref>For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Thomas|title=Design Principles for DSL-Based Access Solutions|url=http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/~legf/Varios/XDSL_MARTI.PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular standards ===\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), [[cdmaOne]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] (EV-DO), [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT), [[Digital AMPS]] (IS-136/TDMA), and [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network]] (iDEN).<ref>{{cite book |last=Paetsch |first=Michael |year=1993 |title=The evolution of mobile communications in the US and Europe: Regulation, technology, and markets |location=Boston, London |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-8900-6688-1}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic scale ==\n{{Area networks}}\nA network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.\n\n;Nanoscale network\nA [[IEEE P1906.1|nanoscale communication]] network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nanoscale Communication Networks |last=Bush |first=S.

Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci546288,00.html |title=personal area network (PAN) |author=Margaret Rouse |website=TechTarget |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n;Local area network\nA [[local area network]] (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [[node (networking)|node]].  Wired LANs are most likely based on [[Ethernet]] technology.  Newer standards such as [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |title=New global standard for fully networked home |publisher=[[ITU]] |website=ITU-T Newslog |accessdate=2011-11-12 |date=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [[wide area network]] (WAN), include higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data transfer rates]], limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [[leased line]]s to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [[IEEE 802.3]] LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100&nbsp;Gbit/s]], standardized by [[IEEE]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |website=IEEE 802.3 ETHERNET WORKING GROUP |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/ba/ |title=IEEE P802.3ba 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Ethernet Task Force |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Currently, [[Terabit Ethernet|400&nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet]] is being developed.\n\nA LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [[router (computing)|router]].\n\n;Home area network\nA [[home area network]] (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) provider.\n\n;Storage area network\nA [[storage area network]] (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\n\n;Campus area network\nA [[campus area network]] (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [[Category 5 cable|Cat5]] cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\n\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n;Backbone network\nA [[backbone network]] is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.  A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.\n\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone.  When designing a network backbone, [[Network performance management|network performance]] and [[network congestion]] are critical factors to take into account.  Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\n\nAnother example of a backbone network is the [[Internet backbone]], which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between [[Wide area network|wide area networks]]&nbsp;(WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\n;Metropolitan area network\nA [[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.\n\n;Wide area network\nA [[wide area network]] (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.  A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: the physical layer, the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]].\n\n;Enterprise private network\nAn [[enterprise private network]] is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\n\n;Virtual private network\nA [[virtual private network]] (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\nVPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.\n\n;Global area network\nA [[global area network]] (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [[wireless LAN]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |website=IEEE 802.20 \u2014 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |title=IEEE 802.20 Mission and Project Scope |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational scope ==\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the [[Internet]], which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\n\n=== Intranet ===\nAn [[intranet]] is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity.  The intranet uses the [[IP address|IP]] protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.\n\n=== Extranet ===\nAn [[extranet]] is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.  For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers.  These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint.  Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n=== Internetwork ===\nAn [[internetwork]] is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on [http://www.opte.org/maps/ opte.org].

This graph represents less than 30% of the [[Classful network|Class C]] networks reachable.]]\nThe [[Internet]] is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. It is the successor of the [[ARPANET|Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) developed by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the [[optical networking]] backbone to enable the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], video transfer and a broad range of information services.\n\nParticipants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system ([[IP address]]es) administered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] and [[regional Internet registry|address registries]]. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the [[routing|reachability]] of their address spaces through the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n=== Darknet ===\nA [[darknet]] is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers&nbsp;\u2014 sometimes called \"friends\" ([[Friend-to-friend|F2F]])<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mansfield-Devine | first1 = Steve\n| title = Darknets\n| doi = 10.1016/S1361-3723(09)70150-2\n| journal = Computer Fraud & Security\n| volume = 2009\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 4\u20136\n|date=December 2009\n}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 using non-standard [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and [[Port (computer networking)|ports]].\n\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networks as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|sharing]] is anonymous (that is, [[IP addresses]] are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Jessica |title=The Darknet: A Digital Copyright Revolution |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and Technology |year=2010 |volume=16 |issue=4 |url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v16i4/article14.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Routing ==\n[[File:XO classroom network.jpg|thumbnail|Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.]]\n[[Routing]] is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [[circuit switching]] networks and [[packet switched network]]s.\n\nIn packet-switched networks, routing directs [[packet forwarding]] (the transit of logically addressed [[network packet]]s from their source toward their ultimate destination)  through intermediate [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [[Computer storage|memory]], is very important for efficient routing.\n\nThere are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nMost routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] in its assumption that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.\n\n== Network service ==\n[[Network service]]s are applications hosted by [[Server (computing)|servers]] on a computer network, to [[Service (systems architecture)|provide some functionality]] for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]], [[E-mail]],<ref>{{IETF RFC|5321}}, \"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\", J.

The throughput is affected by technologies such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.\n\n===Network delay===\n{{main|Network delay}}\nAny data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the [[round-trip time]] can have a significant impact on performance.\n\n=== Quality of service ===\nDepending on the installation requirements, [[network performance]] is usually measured by the [[quality of service]] of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [[throughput]], [[jitter]], [[bit error rate]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [[packet-switched network]], viz. ATM:\n\n*Circuit-switched networks: In [[circuit switched]] networks, network performance is synonymous with the [[grade of service]]. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111015452/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |author=ITU-D Study Group 2 |date=June 2006 |title=Teletraffic Engineering Handbook}}</ref> Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\n*ATM: In an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, [[quality of service]] (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.<ref>[http://www.telecommagazine.com/ Telecommunications Magazine Online], Americas January 2003, Issue Highlights, Online Exclusive: Broadband Access Maximum Performance, Retrieved on February 13, 2005.</ref>{{verification needed |date=August 2018}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [[state diagram|state transition diagrams]] are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |title=State Transition Diagrams |accessdate=July 13, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015010139/http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |archivedate=October 15, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Network congestion ===\n[[Network congestion]] occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its [[quality of service]].  Typical effects include [[queueing delay]], [[packet loss]] or the [[blocking probability|blocking]] of new connections.  A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [[offered load]] lead either to only a small increase in network [[throughput]], or to a reduction in network throughput.\n\n[[Network protocol]]s that use aggressive [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmissions]] to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion\u2014even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as ''congestive collapse''.\n\nModern networks use [[congestion control]], [[congestion avoidance]] and [[Network traffic control|traffic control]] techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [[exponential backoff]] in protocols such as [[802.11]]'s [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] and the original [[Ethernet]], [[sliding window|window]] reduction in [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], and [[fair queueing]] in devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [[802.1p]]. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s) [[Local area network]]ing over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\n\nFor the Internet, {{IETF RFC|2914}} addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n=== Network resilience ===\n[[resilience (network)|Network resilience]] is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] in the face of [[Fault (technology)|faults]] and challenges to normal operation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Resilience |publisher=ResiliNets Research Initiative |title=Definitions: Resilience |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Network security ===\n[[Network security]] consists of provisions and policies adopted by the [[network administrator]] to prevent and monitor [[unauthorized]] access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30176-9_41 | last = Simmonds | first = A |author2=Sandilands, P |author3=van Ekert, L|title = An Ontology for Network Security Attack | volume = 3285 | pages = 317\u2013323 | year = 2004 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-23659-7 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6729bfaf5a6f281a660089831f5f3afaa0dd1f64 }}</ref> Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.  Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.\n\n=== Network surveillance ===\n[[Network surveillance]] is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the [[Internet]]. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\n\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and [[law enforcement]] to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/us-turning-surveillance-society |title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society? |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups\u2014such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\u2014have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and personal freedoms.

It involves the originating party [[encryption|encrypting]] data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [[Internet providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [[confidentiality]] and [[data integrity|integrity]].\n\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include [[HTTPS]] for web traffic, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for [[email]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]] for [[instant messaging]], [[ZRTP]] for [[telephony]], and [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|TETRA]] for radio.\n\nTypical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|clients]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]], not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [[Google Talk]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], [[Facebook]], and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \"end-to-end\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] that subverts negotiation of the [[encryption key]] between the communicating parties, for example [[Skype]] or [[Hushmail]].\n\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [[Exploit (computer security)|technical exploitation]] of [[Client (computing)|clients]], poor quality [[random number generator]]s, or [[key escrow]]. E2EE also does not address [[traffic analysis]], which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n=== SSL/TLS ===\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. [[Netscape Corporation|Netscape]] took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]]. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\"/>\n\n== Views of networks ==\nUsers and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A [[community-of-interest network|community of interest]] has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [[peer-to-peer]] technologies.\n\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network bridge|bridges]] and [[Application-level gateway|application layer gateways]]) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [[subnetwork|subnets]], map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [[Virtual LAN| virtual LAN (VLAN)]] technology.\n\nBoth users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [[intranet]] is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<ref name=\"RFC2547\">{{IETF RFC|2547}}, \"BGP/MPLS VPNs\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999)</ref>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An [[extranet]] is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<ref name=\"RFC2547\" />\n\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [[Internet]] is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered [[IP address]] space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]]. Typically, the [[human-readable]] names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n\nOver the Internet, there can be [[Business-to-business| business-to-business (B2B)]], [[Business-to-consumer| business-to-consumer (B2C)]] and [[Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce|consumer-to-consumer (C2C)]] communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [[communications security]] mechanism.  Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) technology.\n\n== Journals and newsletters ==\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/comp Open Computer Science] ([[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Comparison of network diagram software]]\n*[[Cyberspace]]\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n*[[Information Age]]\n*[[Information revolution]]\n*[[Minimum-Pairs Protocol]]\n*[[Network simulation]]\n*[[Network planning and design]]\n*[[Network traffic control]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Shelly, Gary, et al. \"Discovering Computers\" 2003 Edition.\n* Wendell Odom, Rus Healy, Denise Donohue.

The ability of Ethernet to scale easily (such as quickly adapting to support new fiber optic cable speeds) is a contributing factor to its continued use.<ref name=\"Spurgeon 2000\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nComputer networking may be considered a branch of [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics engineering]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]], [[information technology]] or [[computer engineering]], since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.\n\nA computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, [[online chat]], telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. [[Distributed computing]] uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.\n\nA computer network may be used by [[security hacker]]s to deploy [[computer virus]]es or [[computer worm]]s on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [[denial-of-service attack]].\n\n== Network packet ==\n{{Main|Network packet}}\nComputer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [[Point-to-point link|point-to-point telecommunication links]], simply transmit data as a [[bit stream]]. However, the overwhelming majority of computer networks carry their data in ''packets''. A network packet is a formatted unit of [[data]] (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [[packet-switched network]]. Packets are sent through the network to their destination. A longer message is packetized before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are then reassembled back into their original message.\n\nPackets consist of two kinds of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination [[network address]]es, [[error detection]] codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [[Header (computing)|packet headers]] and [[Trailer (computing)|trailers]], with [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] in between.\n\nWith packets, the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [[circuit switching|circuit switched]]. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is [[message queue|queued]] and waits until a link is free.\n\n== Network topology ==\n[[File:NetworkTopologies.svg|thumb|right|Common network topologies]]\n{{Main|Network topology}}\n\nThe physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.\n\nNetwork topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.\n\nCommon layouts are:\n* A [[bus network]]: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [[Ethernet]], called [[10BASE5]] and [[10BASE2]]. This is still a common topology on the [[data link layer]], although modern [[physical layer]] variants use [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] links instead.\n* A [[star network]]: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [[Wireless LAN]], where each wireless client connects to the central [[Wireless access point]].\n* A [[ring network]]: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) made use of such a topology.\n* A [[mesh network]]: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.\n* A [[fully connected network]]: each node is connected to every other node in the network.\n* A [[tree network]]: nodes are arranged hierarchically.\n\nThe physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [[FDDI]], the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.\n\n=== Overlay network ===\n[[File:Network Overlay merged.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sample overlay network]]\nAn [[overlay network]] is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links.  Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [[peer-to-peer]] networks are overlay networks.  They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.<ref name=over>{{citation |author1=D. Andersen |author2=H. Balakrishnan |author3=M. Kaashoek |author4-link=Robert Tappan Morris |author4=R. Morris |url=http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/papers/ron-sosp2001.html |title=Resilient Overlay Networks |date=October 2001 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\nOverlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using [[modem]]s, before any [[Telecommunications network#Data network|data network]] existed.\n\nThe most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [[telephone network]].<ref name=over /> Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [[Address Resolution Protocol|Address resolution]] and [[routing]] are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.\n\nAnother example of an overlay network is a [[distributed hash table]], which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [[associative array|map]]) indexed by keys.\n\nOverlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [[quality of service]] guarantees to achieve higher-quality [[streaming media]]. Previous proposals such as [[IntServ]], [[DiffServ]], and [[IP Multicast]] have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [[Router (computing)|routers]] in the network.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [[Internet service provider]]s.  The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.\n\nFor example, [[Akamai Technologies]] manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [[multicast]]).  Academic research includes end system multicast,<ref>{{cite web |title= End System Multicast |work= project web site |url= http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ |publisher= Carnegie Mellon University |accessdate= May 25, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050221110350/http://esm.cs.cmu.edu/ |archivedate= February 21, 2005 }}</ref> resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.\n\n== Network links ==\n{{further|Data transmission}}\nThe transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the ''[[Transmission medium|physical medium]]'') used to link devices to form a computer network include [[electrical cable]], [[optical fiber]], and [[radio waves]]. In the [[OSI model]], these are defined at layers 1 and 2 \u2014 the physical layer and the data link layer.\n\nA widely adopted ''family'' of transmission media used in [[local area network]] (LAN) technology is collectively known as [[Ethernet]]. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables.  [[Wireless LAN]] standards use radio waves, others use [[IrDA|infrared]] signals as a transmission medium. [[Power line communication]] uses a building's [[power cabling]] to transmit data.\n\n=== Wired technologies ===\n[[File:Fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Bundle of glass threads with light emitting from the ends|[[Fiber optic cables]] are used to transmit light from one computer/network node to another]]\nThe following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking.\n\n*''[[Coaxial cable]]'' is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.{{citation needed|reason=Coax is fundamentally capable of more than this. This must refer to a specific [[Ethernet over coax]] standard, but that's covered in the point below.|date=September 2018}}\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] technology uses existing [[home wiring]] ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cable]], phone lines and [[Power line communication|power lines]]) to create a high-speed local area network.\n*''[[Twisted pair]]'' cabling is used for wired [[Ethernet]] and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic induction]]. The transmission speed ranges from 2&nbsp;Mbit/s to 10&nbsp;Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several [[category cable|category ratings]], designed for use in various scenarios.\n\n[[File:World map of submarine cables.png|thumb|alt=World map with red and blue lines|2007 map showing submarine optical fiber telecommunication cables around the world.]]\n*An ''[[optical fiber]]'' is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and [[Optical amplifier|optical amplifiers]]. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|wave division multiplexing]], optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [[undersea cables]] to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, [[single-mode optical fiber]] (SMF) and [[multi-mode optical fiber]] (MMF).  Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\">{{Cite book |title=CompTIA Network+ exam guide : (exam N10-005) |last=Meyers |first=Mike |date=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780071789226 |edition=5th |location=New York |oclc=748332969}}</ref>\n\n=== Wireless technologies ===\n[[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black laptop with router in the background |Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links]]\n{{Main|Wireless network}}\nNetwork connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication.\n*''Terrestrial [[microwave]]''&nbsp;\u2013 Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} apart.\n*''[[Communications satellite]]s''&nbsp;\u2013 Satellites communicate also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit {{convert|35,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.\n*''[[Cellular network]]s'' use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low-power [[transceiver]].\n*''Radio and [[spread spectrum]] technologies''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Wireless LAN]]s use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [[IEEE 802.11]] defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [[Wi-Fi]].\n*''[[Free-space optical communication]]'' uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [[line-of-sight propagation]] is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.\n\n=== Exotic technologies ===\nThere have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media.\n* [[IP over Avian Carriers]] was a humorous April fool's [[Request for Comments]], issued as {{IETF RFC|1149}}. It was implemented in real life in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149 |title=Bergen Linux User Group's CPIP Implementation |publisher=Blug.linux.no |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref>\n* Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves, the [[Interplanetary Internet]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113053223/http://www.ipnsig.org/reports/ISART9-2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |title=Interplanetary Internet |publisher=Third Annual International Symposium on Advanced Radio Technologies |author=A. Hooke |date=September 2000 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\nBoth cases have a large [[round-trip delay time]], which gives slow two-way communication but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information.\n\n== Network nodes ==\n{{Main|Node (networking)}}\nApart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic [[Systems engineering|system]] building blocks, such as [[network interface controller]]s (NICs), [[repeater]]s, [[Ethernet hub|hubs]], [[Network bridge|bridges]], [[Network switch|switches]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[modem]]s, and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.\n\n=== Network interfaces ===\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A network interface circuit with port for ATM|An [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.]]\nA [[network interface controller]] (NIC) is [[computer hardware]] that connects the computer to the [[network media]] and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.\n\nIn [[Ethernet]] networks, each network interface controller has a unique [[MAC address|Media Access Control (MAC) address]]\u2014usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [[Octet (computing)|octets]]. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n=== Repeaters and hubs ===\nA [[repeater]] is an [[Electronics|electronic]] device that receives a network [[signal (information theory)|signal]], cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmitted]] at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.\n\nRepeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [[propagation delay]] that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet [[5-4-3 rule]].\n\nAn Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an [[Ethernet hub]]. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern [[network switch]]s.\n\n=== Bridges ===\nA [[network bridge]] connects and filters traffic between two [[network segment]]s at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]] to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.\n\nBridges come in three basic types:\n*Local bridges: Directly connect LANs\n*Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.\n*Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.\n\n=== Switches ===\nA [[network switch]] is a device that forwards and filters [[OSI layer 2]] [[datagram]]s ([[Frame (networking)|frames]]) between [[Computer port (hardware)|ports]] based on the destination MAC address in each frame.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/s/switch.html\n|title=Define switch.\n|website=webopedia\n|accessdate=April 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\nA switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bradley Mitchell |url=http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |title=bridge \u2013 network bridges |website=About.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214940/http://compnetworking.about.com/cs/internetworking/g/bldef_bridge.htm |archive-date=2008-03-28}}</ref> It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.\n\n=== Routers ===\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office router showing the [[ADSL]] telephone line and [[Ethernet]] network cable connections]]\nA [[Router (computing)|router]] is an [[internetworking]] device that forwards [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3).  The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table).  A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a \"null\" interface, also known as the \"black hole\" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.\n\n=== Modems ===\n[[Modem]]s (MOdulator-DEModulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more [[carrier signal]]s are [[modulation|modulated]] by the digital signal to produce an [[analog signal]] that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Modems are commonly used for telephone lines, using a [[digital subscriber line]] technology.\n\n=== Firewalls ===\nA [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] is a network device for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in [[cyberattack|cyber attack]]s.\n\n== Communication protocols ==\n[[File:Internet layering.svg|250px|thumb|alt=Protocols in relation to the Internet layering scheme.|The TCP/IP model or Internet layering scheme and its relation to common protocols often layered on top of it.]]\n[[File:Message flows and Routing.svg|250px|thumb|alt=When a router is present, message flows go down through protocol layers, across to the router, up the stack inside the router and back down again and is sent on to the final destination where it climbs back up the stack|Message flows (A-B) in the presence of a router (R), red flows are effective communication paths, black paths are across the actual network links.]]\nA [[communication protocol]] is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. In a [[protocol stack]] (also see the [[OSI model]]), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol layer below it, until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is [[HTTP]] (the World Wide Web protocol) running over [[transmission control protocol|TCP]] over [[Internet protocol|IP]] (the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]]) over [[IEEE 802.11]] (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [[wireless router]] and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.\n\nCommunication protocols have various characteristics.  They may be [[Connection-oriented communication|connection-oriented]] or [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]], they may use [[circuit mode]] or [[packet switching]], and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.\n\nThere are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.\n\n=== IEEE 802 ===\n[[IEEE 802]] is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [[OSI model]].\n\nFor example, [[Media access control|MAC]] [[Bridging (networking)|bridging]] ([[IEEE 802.1D]]) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [[Spanning Tree Protocol]]. [[IEEE 802.1Q]] describes [[Virtual LAN|VLANs]], and [[IEEE 802.1X]] defines a port-based [[Network Access Control]] protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs)&nbsp;\u2013 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a \"wireless access key\".\n\n==== Ethernet ====\n[[Ethernet]], sometimes simply called ''LAN'', is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called [[IEEE 802.3]] published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].\n\n==== Wireless LAN ====\n[[Wireless LAN]], also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well-known member of the [[IEEE 802]] protocol family for home users today. It is standardized by [[IEEE 802.11]] and shares many properties with wired Ethernet.\n\n=== Internet Protocol Suite ===\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called TCP/IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection-less as well as connection-oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the [[Internet protocol]] (IP) level. At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability.\n\n=== SONET/SDH ===\n[[Synchronous optical networking]] (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [[multiplexing]] protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] voice encoded in [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) frames.\n\n=== Asynchronous Transfer Mode ===\n[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks.  It uses asynchronous [[time-division multiplexing]] and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]]. This differs from other protocols such as the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM has similarity with both [[Circuit switching|circuit]] and [[Packet switching|packet]] switched networking.  This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.\n\nWhile the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [[Next generation network|next-generation networks]], it still plays a role in the [[last mile]], which is the connection between an [[Internet service provider]] and the home user.<ref>For an interesting write-up of the technologies involved, including the deep stacking of communication protocols used, see.{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Thomas|title=Design Principles for DSL-Based Access Solutions|url=http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/~legf/Varios/XDSL_MARTI.PDF|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Cellular standards ===\nThere are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: [[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM), [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), [[cdmaOne]], [[CDMA2000]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] (EV-DO), [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE), [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS), [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT), [[Digital AMPS]] (IS-136/TDMA), and [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network]] (iDEN).<ref>{{cite book |last=Paetsch |first=Michael |year=1993 |title=The evolution of mobile communications in the US and Europe: Regulation, technology, and markets |location=Boston, London |publisher=Artech House |isbn=978-0-8900-6688-1}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic scale ==\n{{Area networks}}\nA network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose.

Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nanoscale Communication Networks |last=Bush |first=S.

Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci546288,00.html |title=personal area network (PAN) |author=Margaret Rouse |website=TechTarget |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.\n\n;Local area network\nA [[local area network]] (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [[node (networking)|node]].  Wired LANs are most likely based on [[Ethernet]] technology.  Newer standards such as [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |title=New global standard for fully networked home |publisher=[[ITU]] |website=ITU-T Newslog |accessdate=2011-11-12 |date=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221090736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [[wide area network]] (WAN), include higher [[bandwidth (computing)|data transfer rates]], limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [[leased line]]s to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [[IEEE 802.3]] LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [[100 Gigabit Ethernet|100&nbsp;Gbit/s]], standardized by [[IEEE]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |website=IEEE 802.3 ETHERNET WORKING GROUP |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/ba/ |title=IEEE P802.3ba 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s Ethernet Task Force |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Currently, [[Terabit Ethernet|400&nbsp;Gbit/s Ethernet]] is being developed.\n\nA LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [[router (computing)|router]].\n\n;Home area network\nA [[home area network]] (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) provider.\n\n;Storage area network\nA [[storage area network]] (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.\n\n;Campus area network\nA [[campus area network]] (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [[Category 5 cable|Cat5]] cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).\n\nFor example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.\n\n;Backbone network\nA [[backbone network]] is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.  A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.\n\nFor example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone.  When designing a network backbone, [[Network performance management|network performance]] and [[network congestion]] are critical factors to take into account.  Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.\n\nAnother example of a backbone network is the [[Internet backbone]], which is a massive, global system of fiber-optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between [[Wide area network|wide area networks]]&nbsp;(WANs), metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks.\n\n;Metropolitan area network\nA [[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.\n\n;Wide area network\nA [[wide area network]] (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances.  A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: the physical layer, the [[data link layer]], and the [[network layer]].\n\n;Enterprise private network\nAn [[enterprise private network]] is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.\n\n;Virtual private network\nA [[virtual private network]] (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.\n\nVPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.\n\n;Global area network\nA [[global area network]] (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [[wireless LAN]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |website=IEEE 802.20 \u2014 Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |title=IEEE 802.20 Mission and Project Scope |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Organizational scope ==\nNetworks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the [[Internet]], which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.\n\n=== Intranet ===\nAn [[intranet]] is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity.  The intranet uses the [[IP address|IP]] protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.\n\n=== Extranet ===\nAn [[extranet]] is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.  For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers.  These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint.  Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.\n\n=== Internetwork ===\nAn [[internetwork]] is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Partial map of the Internet, based on the January 15, 2005 data found on [http://www.opte.org/maps/ opte.org].

This graph represents less than 30% of the [[Classful network|Class C]] networks reachable.]]\nThe [[Internet]] is the largest example of an internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. It is the successor of the [[ARPANET|Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) developed by [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the [[optical networking]] backbone to enable the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]], video transfer and a broad range of information services.\n\nParticipants in the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system ([[IP address]]es) administered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] and [[regional Internet registry|address registries]]. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the [[routing|reachability]] of their address spaces through the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.\n\n=== Darknet ===\nA [[darknet]] is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers&nbsp;\u2014 sometimes called \"friends\" ([[Friend-to-friend|F2F]])<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Mansfield-Devine | first1 = Steve\n| title = Darknets\n| doi = 10.1016/S1361-3723(09)70150-2\n| journal = Computer Fraud & Security\n| volume = 2009\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 4\u20136\n|date=December 2009\n}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 using non-standard [[Communications protocol|protocols]] and [[Port (computer networking)|ports]].\n\nDarknets are distinct from other distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networks as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|sharing]] is anonymous (that is, [[IP addresses]] are not publicly shared), and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.<ref name=Wood>{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Jessica |title=The Darknet: A Digital Copyright Revolution |journal=Richmond Journal of Law and Technology |year=2010 |volume=16 |issue=4 |url=http://jolt.richmond.edu/v16i4/article14.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Routing ==\n[[File:XO classroom network.jpg|thumbnail|Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.]]\n[[Routing]] is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [[circuit switching]] networks and [[packet switched network]]s.\n\nIn packet-switched networks, routing directs [[packet forwarding]] (the transit of logically addressed [[network packet]]s from their source toward their ultimate destination)  through intermediate [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Bridging (networking)|bridges]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [[Computer storage|memory]], is very important for efficient routing.\n\nThere are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nMost routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nRouting, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] in its assumption that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.\n\n== Network service ==\n[[Network service]]s are applications hosted by [[Server (computing)|servers]] on a computer network, to [[Service (systems architecture)|provide some functionality]] for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate.\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]], [[E-mail]],<ref>{{IETF RFC|5321}}, \"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\", J. Klensin (October 2008)</ref> [[printing]] and [[distributed file system|network file sharing]] are examples of well-known network services. Network services such as DNS ([[Domain Name System]]) give names for [[Internet protocol|IP]] and [[MAC address]]es (people remember names like \u201cnm.lan\u201d better than numbers like \u201c210.121.67.18\u201d),<ref name=\"rfc1035\">{{IETF RFC|1035}}, \"Domain names \u2013 Implementation and Specification\", P. Mockapetris (November 1987)</ref> and [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=L.L. |last2=Davie |first2=B.S. |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BvaFreun1W8C&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372 |title=Computer Networks: A Systems Approach |page=372 |edition=5th |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-1238-5060-7}}</ref>\n\nServices are usually based on a [[protocol (computing)|service protocol]] that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.\n\n== Network performance ==\n=== Bandwidth ===\n{{main|Bandwidth (computing)}}\nBandwidth in bit/s may refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved [[throughput]] or [[goodput]], i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The throughput is affected by technologies such as [[bandwidth shaping]], [[bandwidth management]], [[bandwidth throttling]], [[bandwidth cap]], [[bandwidth allocation]] (for example [[bandwidth allocation protocol]] and [[dynamic bandwidth allocation]]), etc. A bit stream's bandwidth  is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz (the average spectral bandwidth of the analog signal representing the bit stream) during a studied time interval.\n\n===Network delay===\n{{main|Network delay}}\nAny data sent across a network requires time to travel from source to destination. Depending on the application, the one-way delay or the [[round-trip time]] can have a significant impact on performance.\n\n=== Quality of service ===\nDepending on the installation requirements, [[network performance]] is usually measured by the [[quality of service]] of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [[throughput]], [[jitter]], [[bit error rate]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]].\n\nThe following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [[packet-switched network]], viz. ATM:\n\n*Circuit-switched networks: In [[circuit switched]] networks, network performance is synonymous with the [[grade of service]]. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111015452/http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/handbook/telenook.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |author=ITU-D Study Group 2 |date=June 2006 |title=Teletraffic Engineering Handbook}}</ref> Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.\n*ATM: In an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, [[quality of service]] (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.<ref>[http://www.telecommagazine.com/ Telecommunications Magazine Online], Americas January 2003, Issue Highlights, Online Exclusive: Broadband Access Maximum Performance, Retrieved on February 13, 2005.</ref>{{verification needed |date=August 2018}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThere are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [[state diagram|state transition diagrams]] are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |title=State Transition Diagrams |accessdate=July 13, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031015010139/http://cne.gmu.edu/modules/os_perf/std.t.html |archivedate=October 15, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Network congestion ===\n[[Network congestion]] occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its [[quality of service]].  Typical effects include [[queueing delay]], [[packet loss]] or the [[blocking probability|blocking]] of new connections.  A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [[offered load]] lead either to only a small increase in network [[throughput]], or to a reduction in network throughput.\n\n[[Network protocol]]s that use aggressive [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmissions]] to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion\u2014even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as ''congestive collapse''.\n\nModern networks use [[congestion control]], [[congestion avoidance]] and [[Network traffic control|traffic control]] techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [[exponential backoff]] in protocols such as [[802.11]]'s [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] and the original [[Ethernet]], [[sliding window|window]] reduction in [[Transmission control protocol|TCP]], and [[fair queueing]] in devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]]. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [[802.1p]]. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s) [[Local area network]]ing over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).\n\nFor the Internet, {{IETF RFC|2914}} addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.\n\n=== Network resilience ===\n[[resilience (network)|Network resilience]] is \"the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] in the face of [[Fault (technology)|faults]] and challenges to normal operation.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.ittc.ku.edu/resilinets_wiki/index.php/Definitions#Resilience |publisher=ResiliNets Research Initiative |title=Definitions: Resilience |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Computer security}}\n\n=== Network security ===\n[[Network security]] consists of provisions and policies adopted by the [[network administrator]] to prevent and monitor [[unauthorized]] access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network-accessible resources.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-30176-9_41 | last = Simmonds | first = A |author2=Sandilands, P |author3=van Ekert, L|title = An Ontology for Network Security Attack | volume = 3285 | pages = 317\u2013323 | year = 2004 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-23659-7 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6729bfaf5a6f281a660089831f5f3afaa0dd1f64 }}</ref> Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority.  Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies and individuals.\n\n=== Network surveillance ===\n[[Network surveillance]] is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the [[Internet]]. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.\n\nComputer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.\n\nSurveillance is very useful to governments and [[law enforcement]] to maintain [[social control]], recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [[criminal]] activity. With the advent of programs such as the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, technologies such as [[NarusInsight|high-speed surveillance computers]] and [[Surveillance#Biometric|biometrics]] software, and laws such as the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]], governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.<ref name=\"us-surveillance-soc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/other/us-turning-surveillance-society |title=Is the U.S. Turning Into a Surveillance Society? |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many [[civil rights]] and [[privacy]] groups\u2014such as [[Reporters Without Borders]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\u2014have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a [[mass surveillance]] society, with limited political and personal freedoms.

It involves the originating party [[encryption|encrypting]] data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [[Internet providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [[confidentiality]] and [[data integrity|integrity]].\n\nExamples of end-to-end encryption include [[HTTPS]] for web traffic, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for [[email]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging|OTR]] for [[instant messaging]], [[ZRTP]] for [[telephony]], and [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|TETRA]] for radio.\n\nTypical [[Server (computing)|server]]-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [[Client (computing)|clients]] and [[Server (computing)|servers]], not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [[Google Talk]], [[Yahoo Messenger]], [[Facebook]], and [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering \"end-to-end\" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] that subverts negotiation of the [[encryption key]] between the communicating parties, for example [[Skype]] or [[Hushmail]].\n\nThe end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [[Exploit (computer security)|technical exploitation]] of [[Client (computing)|clients]], poor quality [[random number generator]]s, or [[key escrow]]. E2EE also does not address [[traffic analysis]], which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.\n\n=== SSL/TLS ===\nThe introduction and rapid growth of e-commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. [[Netscape Corporation|Netscape]] took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was [[Netscape Navigator]]. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer (SSL). SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL-secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate (all web browsers come with an exhaustive list of CA root certificates preloaded), and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric-key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.<ref name=\"1961- 2012\"/>\n\n== Views of networks ==\nUsers and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running.  A [[community-of-interest network|community of interest]] has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [[peer-to-peer]] technologies.\n\nNetwork administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[Network bridge|bridges]] and [[Application-level gateway|application layer gateways]]) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [[subnetwork|subnets]], map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [[Virtual LAN| virtual LAN (VLAN)]] technology.\n\nBoth users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [[intranet]] is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).<ref name=\"RFC2547\">{{IETF RFC|2547}}, \"BGP/MPLS VPNs\", E. Rosen; Y. Rekhter (March 1999)</ref>  Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection.  An [[extranet]] is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).<ref name=\"RFC2547\" />\n\nUnofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [[Internet]] is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered [[IP address]] space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]]. Typically, the [[human-readable]] names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n\nOver the Internet, there can be [[Business-to-business| business-to-business (B2B)]], [[Business-to-consumer| business-to-consumer (B2C)]] and [[Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce|consumer-to-consumer (C2C)]] communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [[communications security]] mechanism.  Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) technology.\n\n== Journals and newsletters ==\n* [https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/comp Open Computer Science] ([[Open access (publishing)|open access]] journal)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Comparison of network diagram software]]\n*[[Cyberspace]]\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n*[[Information Age]]\n*[[Information revolution]]\n*[[Minimum-Pairs Protocol]]\n*[[Network simulation]]\n*[[Network planning and design]]\n*[[Network traffic control]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Shelly, Gary, et al. \"Discovering Computers\" 2003 Edition.\n* Wendell Odom, Rus Healy, Denise Donohue.

Completed in the 1710s, it forms a half-length group portrait, possibly the rarest case in Watteau's body of work, and has been given various interpretatons; some scholars believe it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]], while some others believe it to be a depiction of members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]. Because of that, the painting has been known under a number of various titles; its traditional naming in Western scholarship, ''Coquettes qui pour voir'', is derived from anonymous verses which the painting was featured with in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s [[Recueil Jullienne|four-volume collection]] of engravings after Watteau's works.  \n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, ''Coquettes'' belonged to {{ill|Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers|fr|Louis Antoine Crozat}}, a nephew of the Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]]; after his death in 1770, the painting, along with a most part of the collection he owned, was acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. Since then the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition.

Completed in the 1710s, it forms a half-length group portrait, possibly the rarest case in Watteau's body of work, and has been given various interpretatons; some scholars believe it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]], while some others believe it to be a depiction of members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]. Because of that, the painting has been known under a number of various titles; its traditional naming in Western scholarship, ''Coquettes qui pour voir'', is derived from anonymous verses which the painting was featured with in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s [[Recueil Jullienne|four-volume collection]] of engravings after Watteau's works.  \n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, ''Coquettes'' belonged to {{ill|Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers|fr|Louis Antoine Crozat}}, a nephew of the Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]]; after his death in 1770, the painting, along with a most part of the collection he owned, was acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. Since then the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. In Russian literature, the painting is currently known as '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}; adopted into French as ''Acteurs de la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise''<ref name=bordeaux1980/> or ''Les comediens fran\u00e7ais''.{{sfn|Zolotov|1985|p=98}}}}, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A.

To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Qatar has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|world's third largest proven natural gas reserve]] and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|second-largest exporter of natural gas]].\n\n==Energy sector==\n{{main|Energy in Qatar}}\nBefore the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939.<ref name=emboil>{{cite web|title='''The Qatar Oil Discoveries''', Rasoul Sorkhabi, Ph.D., in GEO ExPro Magazine, Vol. 7, No. 1 - 2010|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2010/01/the-qatar-oil-discoveries}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.onlineqatar.com/info/tourist-info.aspx\n|title=Qatar tourist information guide\n|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref> In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC ([[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]]) quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South [[Asia]], have grown again.\n\nOil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023. However, large [[natural gas]] reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and condensate reserves. For example, the state owned [[Qatar Petroleum]] found 2 offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later.\n\nThe gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3 blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities (PS-1, ALK, K & A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qp.com.qa/en/QPActivities/QPOperations/Pages/OilandGasDetails.aspx?OID=10|title=Oil and Gas Details|website=www.qp.com.qa}}</ref> Like with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023 is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.\n\nQatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000&nbsp;km\u00b3 (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to [[Japan]]. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m\u00b3) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.\n890-\nQatar pursues a vigorous program of \"[[Qatarization]]\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.\n\n==Industry==\nThe government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feedstock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of [[Ras Laffan Industrial City]] and [[Mesaieed Industrial Area]], which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. [[Industries Qatar]] (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East's largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP.\n\nPetrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the development boom swept the [[Persian Gulf]] region. But the global financial crisis has put a significant dent in demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor sentiment remains cautious. The crisis has in fact impacted the whole of the industrial sector \u2013 IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than 90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of $2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example, is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead. Qatar is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in 2009 \u2013 the hope is it will be enough to keep the industrial sector on an upward trajectory.\n\n==Financial sector==\nThe Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks. Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008. But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks\u2019 positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and an additional 5% at the end of 2009.\n\nThe Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank's (QCB's) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar's economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar's banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.\n\nThe [[International Monetary Fund]] in its spring assessment 2019 said that Qatar has \u201csuccessfully absorbed the shocks\u201d of the blockade imposed in 2017 and the dropped oil prices from 2014 to 2016. [[S&P Global]] had marked Qatar's outlook to negative in 2017, but changed it to stable in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/how-qatars-cows-show-the-growing-resistance-to-a-saudi-led-boycott/2019/07/19/78880256-a4b2-11e9-a767-d7ab84aef3e9_story.html?noredirect=on|title=How Qatar\u2019s cows show the growing resistance to a Saudi-led boycott|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, [[Qatar Central Bank]] stated that the country's economic growth will see a boost over the next two years amid expectations of stable oil prices and continued strong exports. The GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.8% between 2018 and 2020, with the budget surplus falling to 4.35 billion riyals in 2019, from a surplus of 15.1 billion riyals in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL8N25B1OF|title=Qatar says economic growth to accelerate in 2019-2020|agency=Reuters|accessdate=15 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Islamic finance===\nThe [[Islamic finance]] sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion's share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. The global financial crisis slowed this growth though. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking services.\n\n===Capital market===\nThe stock [[market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Qatar was valued at $95,487 million in 2007 by the [[World Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html|title=Data - Finance|date=5 December 2006|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205235151/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html|archivedate=5 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As 2008 drew to a close, no capital markets around the globe, including Qatar's, were immune to the effects of the sub-prime fallout. That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. The move improved investor optimism and is hoped to prevent the market from falling further. The proposal to create a single unified regulator as early as 2010 to oversee all banking and financial services is viewed as another promising development that will transform the financial sector for the better.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Qatar Lagoon.jpg|thumb|260px|The Pearl Qatar]]\nUnder the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010. The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012. In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the [[Hamad International Airport]], which will have the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers upon the completion of the first phase in 2012.\n\nOther niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha's [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]], and sports tourism, initially spurred by the [[Asian Games]], to which [[2006 Asian Games|Qatar played host in 2006]]. The government appears to be committed to long-term expansion plans, but challenges nevertheless remain, including effective marketing to the international community as well as the effect of the financial crisis on global tourism appetite.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Qatar, Dukhan Highway.JPG|thumb|right|Highway Q3 (from Doha to [[Dukhan]])]]\n{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\n[[File:Qatar, Al Khor (10), harbour, offloading fish.JPG|thumb|left|Scene in the harbour of [[Al Khor]]. Fisheries is a minor sector in Qatar, and production is almost exclusively for domestic consumption.]]\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The [[New Doha International Airport]] is one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an integral part of Qatar's economic development as it focuses on LNG and industrial exports. The port at Mesaieed is undergoing expansion. While the financial crisis may present challenges to infrastructure development, once all projects are completed Qatar will have one of the most advanced and modern transport infrastructures in the region.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\nQatar is now the richest country in the world, on a per person basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gfmag.com/component/content/article/119-economic-data/12529-the-worlds-richest-and-poorest-countries.html#axzz2kwuAF9FV|title=The World's Richest and Poorest Countries|work=Global Finance Magazine|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Current GDP per capita registered a world record-breaking peak growth of 1,156% in the 70s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |title=What We Do |accessdate=3 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131140920/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |archivedate=31 January 2008 }}</ref> This became quickly unsustainable and Qatar's current GDP per capita contracted 53% in the 80s.

Qatar has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|world's third largest proven natural gas reserve]] and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|second-largest exporter of natural gas]].\n\n==Energy sector==\n{{main|Energy in Qatar}}\nBefore the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939.<ref name=emboil>{{cite web|title='''The Qatar Oil Discoveries''', Rasoul Sorkhabi, Ph.D., in GEO ExPro Magazine, Vol. 7, No. 1 - 2010|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2010/01/the-qatar-oil-discoveries}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.onlineqatar.com/info/tourist-info.aspx\n|title=Qatar tourist information guide\n|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref> In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC ([[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]]) quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South [[Asia]], have grown again.\n\nOil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023. However, large [[natural gas]] reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and condensate reserves. For example, the state owned [[Qatar Petroleum]] found 2 offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later.\n\nThe gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3 blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities (PS-1, ALK, K & A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qp.com.qa/en/QPActivities/QPOperations/Pages/OilandGasDetails.aspx?OID=10|title=Oil and Gas Details|website=www.qp.com.qa}}</ref> Like with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023 is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.\n\nQatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000&nbsp;km\u00b3 (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to [[Japan]]. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m\u00b3) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.\n890-\nQatar pursues a vigorous program of \"[[Qatarization]]\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.\n\n==Industry==\nThe government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feedstock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of [[Ras Laffan Industrial City]] and [[Mesaieed Industrial Area]], which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. [[Industries Qatar]] (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East's largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP.\n\nPetrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the development boom swept the [[Persian Gulf]] region. But the global financial crisis has put a significant dent in demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor sentiment remains cautious. The crisis has in fact impacted the whole of the industrial sector \u2013 IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than 90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of $2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example, is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead. Qatar is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in 2009 \u2013 the hope is it will be enough to keep the industrial sector on an upward trajectory.\n\n==Financial sector==\nThe Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks. Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008. But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks\u2019 positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and an additional 5% at the end of 2009.\n\nThe Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank's (QCB's) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar's economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar's banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.\n\nThe [[International Monetary Fund]] in its spring assessment 2019 said that Qatar has \u201csuccessfully absorbed the shocks\u201d of the blockade imposed in 2017 and the dropped oil prices from 2014 to 2016. [[S&P Global]] had marked Qatar's outlook to negative in 2017, but changed it to stable in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/how-qatars-cows-show-the-growing-resistance-to-a-saudi-led-boycott/2019/07/19/78880256-a4b2-11e9-a767-d7ab84aef3e9_story.html?noredirect=on|title=How Qatar\u2019s cows show the growing resistance to a Saudi-led boycott|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, [[Qatar Central Bank]] stated that the country's economic growth will see a boost over the next two years amid expectations of stable oil prices and continued strong exports. The GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.8% between 2018 and 2020, with the budget surplus falling to 4.35 billion riyals in 2019, from a surplus of 15.1 billion riyals in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL8N25B1OF|title=Qatar says economic growth to accelerate in 2019-2020|agency=Reuters|accessdate=15 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Islamic finance===\nThe [[Islamic finance]] sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion's share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. The global financial crisis slowed this growth though. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking services.\n\n===Capital market===\nThe stock [[market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Qatar was valued at $95,487 million in 2007 by the [[World Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html|title=Data - Finance|date=5 December 2006|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205235151/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html|archivedate=5 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As 2008 drew to a close, no capital markets around the globe, including Qatar's, were immune to the effects of the sub-prime fallout. That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. The move improved investor optimism and is hoped to prevent the market from falling further. The proposal to create a single unified regulator as early as 2010 to oversee all banking and financial services is viewed as another promising development that will transform the financial sector for the better.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Qatar Lagoon.jpg|thumb|260px|The Pearl Qatar]]\nUnder the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010. The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012. In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the [[Hamad International Airport]], which will have the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers upon the completion of the first phase in 2012.\n\nOther niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha's [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]], and sports tourism, initially spurred by the [[Asian Games]], to which [[2006 Asian Games|Qatar played host in 2006]]. The government appears to be committed to long-term expansion plans, but challenges nevertheless remain, including effective marketing to the international community as well as the effect of the financial crisis on global tourism appetite.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Qatar, Dukhan Highway.JPG|thumb|right|Highway Q3 (from Doha to [[Dukhan]])]]\n{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\n[[File:Qatar, Al Khor (10), harbour, offloading fish.JPG|thumb|left|Scene in the harbour of [[Al Khor]]. Fisheries is a minor sector in Qatar, and production is almost exclusively for domestic consumption.]]\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The [[New Doha International Airport]] is one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an integral part of Qatar's economic development as it focuses on LNG and industrial exports. The port at Mesaieed is undergoing expansion. While the financial crisis may present challenges to infrastructure development, once all projects are completed Qatar will have one of the most advanced and modern transport infrastructures in the region.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\nQatar is now the richest country in the world, on a per person basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gfmag.com/component/content/article/119-economic-data/12529-the-worlds-richest-and-poorest-countries.html#axzz2kwuAF9FV|title=The World's Richest and Poorest Countries|work=Global Finance Magazine|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Current GDP per capita registered a world record-breaking peak growth of 1,156% in the 70s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |title=What We Do |accessdate=3 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131140920/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |archivedate=31 January 2008 }}</ref> This became quickly unsustainable and Qatar's current GDP per capita contracted 53% in the 80s.
