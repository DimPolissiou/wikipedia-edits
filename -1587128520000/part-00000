It is also up to 102 kg lighter than the previous model. The interior length of the third-generation \u0160KODA Octavia has grown - in comparison to its predecessor - by {{convert|33|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1,782|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, while the legroom for the backseat passengers grew by {{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to now {{convert|73|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. The headroom in the back was increased to {{convert|980|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} (Octavia II: {{convert|966|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}). The elbow width was also increased, in the front by {{convert|39|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1,454|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, and in the rear by {{convert|26|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1,499|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.

The radar sensor in the front bumper monitors the area in front of the vehicle and continually evaluates the distance, direction, and speed of all nearby objects (not only traffic). This radar provides data for two assistants in the Octavia: Front Assistant  ([[Precrash system|forward collision warning]] and emergency braking) and Adaptive Cruise Assistant (adaptive cruise control). A monochromatic fixed-focus multifunction camera is mounted on the windscreen in front of the rear mirror, and allows function of Lane Assistant (lane keeping system), Intelligent Light Assistant (automatic control of the high beams) and Traffic Sign Recognition (recognises and shows traffic signs on displays of both on-board computer and satellite navigation). Added to this are assists, whose functionality is based on evaluating data provided by ESC or steering sensors: Crew Protect Assistant (proactive passenger protection), and Driver Activity Assistant (fatigue detection).\n\nThe Octavia features numerous so-called \u2018Simply Clever\u2018 details, i.e. an ice scraper inside the fuel filler flap, a rubbish bin inside the door panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in the boot.  A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available as an option \u2013 single-piece for the Octavia sedan and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen, and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system\u2019s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna in the bottom of the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.\n\nFor the front-wheel Octavia, engine outputs are offered of 63\u2013132&nbsp;kW (86\u2013179 PS) on petrol/gasoline cars and 66\u2013110&nbsp;kW (90\u2013150 PS) for the diesel engines. The two environmentally friendly versions of the Octavia are: the [[BlueMotion|GreenLine]] version with 1.6-litre diesel produces only 85 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per km; the G-TEC is fitted with 1.4-litre TSI engine running on CNG and emitting 97 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per km. The all-wheel drive Octavia Combi can be powered by one petrol (1.8 TSI/132&nbsp;kW) and three diesel engines (ranging from 77-135&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe Octavia RS, available in both the sedan and estate body styles, was premiered at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] 2013. It features the 162&nbsp;kW (220 PS) 2.0 TSI engine from the newly launched Golf 7 GTI and the 135&nbsp;kW (184 PS) 2.0 TDI engine from the Golf 7 GTD. With a top speed of {{Convert|248|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, the Octavia RS with petrol engine and manual gearbox was acclaimed to be the fastest production Octavia ever. In comparison with standard car, the sports Octavia features progressive steering (variable-ratio steering), sports chassis, electronic differential lock (XDS) and so-called \u2018Performance Sound Generator\u2018, that enhances sporty sound of the engine. The source of sound vibrations is the electromagnetic pulse generator placed in the area under/in front of the windshield. The sound vibrations are spreading into the car\u2019s cabin through the body and the windshield. The frequency and intensity of the sound is dependent not only on the profile chosen, but also the engine revolutions, driving speed and engine load (the throttle pedal position). The generated sound is directed inside the cabin, especially to the front seat area. \u0160koda used the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]] to shine the spotlight on its new and more powerful Octavia RS 230. The car has 230 PS (10 PS more than stock) and this helps it shave a tenth off its benchmark sprint time and adds 2&nbsp;km/h to the car\u2019s top speed which increases to 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph); it also gets a standard electronic differential in this version and lower, stiffer springs.\n\nIn early 2014, \u0160koda revealed the Scout; it has raised suspension, plastic cladding, and four-wheel drive.\n\nIn early 2017, the third-generation facelift Octavia arrived in the showrooms, with the main visible difference being the split front headlights.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0160koda Octavia 2017: Facelift se sv\u011btly ve stylu Mercedesu byl odhalen|url=http://autobible.euro.cz/skoda-octavia-2017-facelift-se-svetly-ve-stylu-mercedes-byl-odhalen-jak-se-vam-libi/|website=automobile.cz|date=27 October 2016|language=Czech}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Euro NCAP]] test results\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u0160koda Octavia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/results/skoda/octavia/512.aspx |title=Skoda Octavia |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref>  2013 {{rating|5|5}}\n|-\n|'''Test'''\n|'''Score'''\n|-\n|Adult occupant:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|93%\n|-\n|Child occupant:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|86%\n|-\n|Pedestrian:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|66%\n|-\n|Safety assist:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|66%\n|-\n|}\n\n===Engines===\nOverview of engines available for the third-generation Octavia (A7, Typ 5E) with front-wheel drive, including vRS version.\n\n<big>'''[[Petrol engine]]s'''</big>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

It is also up to 102 kg lighter than the previous model. The interior length of the third-generation \u0160KODA Octavia has grown - in comparison to its predecessor - by {{convert|33|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1,782|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, while the legroom for the backseat passengers grew by {{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to now {{convert|73|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. The headroom in the back was increased to {{convert|980|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} (Octavia II: {{convert|966|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}). The elbow width was also increased, in the front by {{convert|39|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1,454|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, and in the rear by {{convert|26|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1,499|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.

The radar sensor in the front bumper monitors the area in front of the vehicle and continually evaluates the distance, direction, and speed of all nearby objects (not only traffic). This radar provides data for two assistants in the Octavia: Front Assistant  ([[Precrash system|forward collision warning]] and emergency braking) and Adaptive Cruise Assistant (adaptive cruise control). A monochromatic fixed-focus multifunction camera is mounted on the windscreen in front of the rear mirror, and allows function of Lane Assistant (lane keeping system), Intelligent Light Assistant (automatic control of the high beams) and Traffic Sign Recognition (recognises and shows traffic signs on displays of both on-board computer and satellite navigation). Added to this are assists, whose functionality is based on evaluating data provided by ESC or steering sensors: Crew Protect Assistant (proactive passenger protection), and Driver Activity Assistant (fatigue detection).\n\nThe Octavia features numerous so-called \u2018Simply Clever\u2018 details, i.e. an ice scraper inside the fuel filler flap, a rubbish bin inside the door panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in the boot.  A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available as an option \u2013 single-piece for the Octavia sedan and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen, and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system\u2019s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna in the bottom of the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.\n\nFor the front-wheel Octavia, engine outputs are offered of 63\u2013132&nbsp;kW (86\u2013179 PS) on petrol/gasoline cars and 66\u2013110&nbsp;kW (90\u2013150 PS) for the diesel engines. The two environmentally friendly versions of the Octavia are: the [[BlueMotion|GreenLine]] version with 1.6-litre diesel produces only 85 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per km; the G-TEC is fitted with 1.4-litre TSI engine running on CNG and emitting 97 grams of CO<sub>2</sub> per km. The all-wheel drive Octavia Combi can be powered by one petrol (1.8 TSI/132&nbsp;kW) and three diesel engines (ranging from 77-135&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe Octavia RS, available in both the sedan and estate body styles, was premiered at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] 2013. It features the 162&nbsp;kW (220 PS) 2.0 TSI engine from the newly launched Golf 7 GTI and the 135&nbsp;kW (184 PS) 2.0 TDI engine from the Golf 7 GTD. With a top speed of {{Convert|248|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, the Octavia RS with petrol engine and manual gearbox was acclaimed to be the fastest production Octavia ever. In comparison with standard car, the sports Octavia features progressive steering (variable-ratio steering), sports chassis, electronic differential lock (XDS) and so-called \u2018Performance Sound Generator\u2018, that enhances sporty sound of the engine. The source of sound vibrations is the electromagnetic pulse generator placed in the area under/in front of the windshield. The sound vibrations are spreading into the car\u2019s cabin through the body and the windshield. The frequency and intensity of the sound is dependent not only on the profile chosen, but also the engine revolutions, driving speed and engine load (the throttle pedal position). The generated sound is directed inside the cabin, especially to the front seat area. \u0160koda used the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|2015 Geneva Motor Show]] to shine the spotlight on its new and more powerful Octavia RS 230. The car has 230 PS (10 PS more than stock) and this helps it shave a tenth off its benchmark sprint time and adds 2&nbsp;km/h to the car\u2019s top speed which increases to 250&nbsp;km/h (155&nbsp;mph); it also gets a standard electronic differential in this version and lower, stiffer springs.\n\nIn early 2014, \u0160koda revealed the Scout; it has raised suspension, plastic cladding, and four-wheel drive.\n\nIn early 2017, the third-generation facelift Octavia arrived in the showrooms, with the main visible difference being the split front headlights.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0160koda Octavia 2017: Facelift se sv\u011btly ve stylu Mercedesu byl odhalen|url=http://autobible.euro.cz/skoda-octavia-2017-facelift-se-svetly-ve-stylu-mercedes-byl-odhalen-jak-se-vam-libi/|website=automobile.cz|date=27 October 2016|language=Czech}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Euro NCAP]] test results\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u0160koda Octavia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/results/skoda/octavia/512.aspx |title=Skoda Octavia |publisher=Euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref>  2013 {{rating|5|5}}\n|-\n|'''Test'''\n|'''Score'''\n|-\n|Adult occupant:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|93%\n|-\n|Child occupant:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|86%\n|-\n|Pedestrian:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|66%\n|-\n|Safety assist:\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|66%\n|-\n|}\n\n===Engines===\nOverview of engines available for the third-generation Octavia (A7, Typ 5E) with front-wheel drive, including vRS version.\n\n<big>'''[[Petrol engine]]s'''</big>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

A complete Yuga cycle consists of ''[[Satya Yuga]]'', ''[[Treta Yuga]],'' ''[[Dvapara Yuga]], and'' ''[[Kali Yuga]]''. Traditionally, Kali Yuga is followed by Satya Yuga at the start of each cycle (S,T,D,K) (S,T,D,K). Some modern scholars believe in shorter descending and ascending Yugas within each cycle (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S) (S,T,D,K,K,D,T,S). \n\nAccording to the epic [[Mahabharata]], the current age is Kali Yuga and it started in the year 3102 BCE after lord [[Krishna]] left this world. One can also compare the current age with the characteristics described for each yuga and see that Kali Yuga is the best match. \n\nSome scholars say that our present time is ascending Kali Yuga,<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BBwLVlOipyUC&pg=PA15&dq=four+yugas#v=onepage&q=four%20yugas&f=false| title=The Path to Immortality|page=15|first1= Mark L.|last1=Prophet|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Clare Prophet|author2-link=Elizabeth Clare Prophet|publisher= Summit University Press| isbn=9781932890099| year=2006}}</ref> while some other scholars say that Kali Yuga ended in 1700 CE and now we're in ascending Dwapara Yuga.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Holy Science|last=Swami|first=Sri Yukeshwar Giri|publisher=Yogoda Satsang Society|year=1949|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics of the four Yugas ==\nThere are four Yugas in one cycle:\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' (or Krita Yuga)\n* ''[[Treta Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Dwapara Yuga]]''\n* ''[[Kali Yuga]]''\n\n=== Characteristics of each Yuga ===\n\n* '''Satya Yuga''' (\"The age of truth\" or \"[[Golden Age#Hindu|Golden Age]]\"): The first and best yuga. It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. Each Yuga cycle repeats four yugas (ages) in the following order: Satya Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years. When he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. The entire duration of life for the universe is: \n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE).

It was the age of truth and perfection. This yuga had no crimes and all humans were kind and friendly. The Krita Yuga was so named because there was but one religion, and all men were saintly: therefore they were not required to perform religious ceremonies. Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Treta Yuga''': This is the second yuga in order. However, \"treta\" means the \"third\". In this age, virtue diminishes slightly. At the beginning of the age, many emperors rise to dominance and conquer the world. Wars become frequent and weather begins to change to extremities. People become slightly diminished compared to their predecessors. Agriculture, labour and mining become existent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n* '''Dvapara Yuga''': This is the third yuga in order. However, \"dvapara\" means \"two\". In this age, people become tainted with qualities and aren't as strong as their ancestors. Diseases become rampant. Humans are discontent and fight each other. Vedas are divided into four parts. People still possess characteristics of youth in old age. Average lifespan of humans is around a few centuries.\n\n* '''Kal Yuga''': The final age. It is the age of darkness and ignorance. People stop following [[Dharma]] and lack virtue. They become slaves to their passions and are barely as powerful as their earliest ancestors in the Satya Yuga. Society falls into disuse and people become liars and hypocrites. Knowledge is lost and scriptures are diminished. Humans eat forbidden and dirty food. The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. Each Yuga cycle contains 4 yugas (ages) in the following order: Satya Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga.\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years. When he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. The entire duration of life for the universe is: \n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\".

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

Her father died in 1895 and her mother set up in business. In 1903, Florence's mother married again, to a 28-year-old Syrian book-keeper named John Fawaz, and Florence took the name '''Florence Fawaz'''.<ref name=\"adob\"/>\n\n==Career==\nShe was discovered by the choirmaster [[Edward Sugden (methodist)|Rev. Edward Sugden]] at the Wesleyan [[Methodist Church]] in Palmerston Street, Carlton, [[Melbourne]] (now Church of All Nations). In 1914, she won first prizes in both the soprano and [[mezzo-soprano]] categories at a singing contest in [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], obtaining a scholarship which enabled her to continue her studies with [[Elise Wiedermann]]. She went to New York in 1919 to study further with Gabriele Sibella. Her voice impressed influential listeners and she was offered a contract to sing at the Metropolitan Opera; but she declined the Met offer to gain stage experience in England, and never again had a chance to sing with the New York company.\n\nAustral duly went to London where she was promoted by the leading British [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] of the day, [[Robert Radford]]. She made her Covent Garden debut on 16 May 1922 as Br\u00fcnnhilde in Wagner's ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'', and later in the same role in ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''. She shared this role with [[Frida Leider]], who received greater acclaim due to her superior acting skills. Austral's other roles at Covent Garden included ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Isolde]]'' and the title role in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]''.\n\nIn 1923, Austral appeared with Dame [[Nellie Melba]], who called her, \"One of the wonder voices of the world\", praising the purity of her tone and the gleaming power of her high notes. Unfortunately for her career, due to prevailing circumstances and the reputed antipathy of conductor [[Bruno Walter]], she ended up singing more with the [[British National Opera Company]] than at Covent Garden in the 1920s.\n\nDuring the mid-1920s she made the first of more than 100 recordings for [[HMV]], which are still treasured by music-lovers and collectors. The famous recording engineer and producer at HMV, [[Fred Gaisberg]], said: \"In the early twenties Florence Austral was the most important recording artist we had, thanks to the beauty, power and compass of her voice\". She recorded operatic arias as well as songs, sacred music and oratorio extracts. She can be heard, too, in superb duets opposite [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Miguel Fleta]], [[Tudor Davies]] and [[Walter Widdop]] that employ both the acoustic and electrical recording processes. (Her acoustic recordings for HMV include the pioneering, English-language series of excerpts from ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring Cycle]]''.)\n\nIn 1925, Austral became the second wife of the Australian flautist [[John Amadio]], and they toured widely together in America, Europe and Australia. She often sang in the Ring operas in [[Philadelphia]], and in concert under the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]]. However, she never appeared at [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]], or at the [[Vienna State Opera]]. She was negotiating to sing in Vienna, but this did not eventuate.\n\nAustral, however, did become a principal singer with the esteemed [[Berlin State Opera]] in 1930. It was there in that same year that she showed the first signs of [[multiple sclerosis]], which manifested themselves on stage during a performance of ''Die Walk\u00fcre'' opposite [[bass-baritone]] [[Friedrich Schorr]]. Her opera career gradually suffered as a result of the advance of this debilitating disease, but she was still able to devote herself to concert and recital work, developing a large lieder repertoire, although she also sang operatic pieces. Her appearances in opera during this time included ones in her home country, Australia, where she toured with tenor Walter Widdop in 1934\u201335, singing the Australian premiere of [[Les p\u00eacheurs de perles]].\n\nShe returned to Britain in 1939, and appeared in many benefit concerts during the early part of [[World War II]], before her illness forced her to retire in 1940. In 1946 she returned to Australia. Many of her possessions were lost in a fire. Royalty earnings from her recordings had declined, too, and she found herself in need of an income, so she taught singing at the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] Conservatorium (now part of the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia) from 1954 until her retirement in 1959.\n\n==Death==\nAustral gave a few newspaper interviews in her retirement. She died of [[cerebrovascular disease]] in a church home for the aged at [[Mayfield, New South Wales|Mayfield, Newcastle]], on 15 May 1968.<ref name=\"adob\"/> By general critical consent, she remains the finest dramatic soprano ever produced by Australia, as her various recordings, now available on CD reissues, readily attest.\n\n===Tributes===\n:''The Waters of the Rhine seem to mount high, and over all rides the triumphant voice of Florence Austral as Brunnhilde. Her singing can justly be called queenly. Even after hearing the glorious singing of Frida Leider on other records, Austral's triumphant voice remains in the mind.''\n::::Neville Cardus, ''Manchester Guardian'', 1928.\n\n:\"In the early twenties Florence Austral was the most important recording artist we had, thanks to the beauty, power and compass of her voice.\" -- Fred Gaisberg, HMV (later EMI)\n\n==References==\n*Elphinstone, Michael and Wayne Hancock, ''When Austral Sang: the Biography of Florence Austral'', Hyde Park Press, Richmond, South Australia, 2005, 655pp. {{ISBN|0-646-44033-0}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;page=0;query=Person%3A%22%2FPerson%2Fkey%2F30198-1%22;resCount=10 Florence Austral Collection] at the [[National Film and Sound Archive]], includes sound recordings, photographs, programs, recording notes, scripts etc.\n* [http://www.theartscentre.com.au/discover/collections-and-research/performing-arts-collection-directory/opera-collection.aspx?view=list&filter=-1&page=1#listing Florence Austral Collection] in the Performing Arts Collection, the Arts Centre, Melbourne (news clippings, photographs, programmes etc.)\n* [http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A574828%20|%20Number%3A574827%20Online%3Atrue;querytype=;rec=1;resCount=10 Listen to the Last Rose of Summer at the National Film and Sound Archive]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Austral, Florence}}\n[[Category:1892 births]]\n[[Category:1968 deaths]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Australian operatic sopranos]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century opera singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century women opera singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 111356 Florence Austral, opera singer, 1929.jpg|210px|thumb|Florence Austral]]\n'''Florence Austral''' (26 April 1892 \u2013 15 May 1968) was an Australian operatic [[soprano]] renowned for her interpretation of the most demanding [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]ian female roles, although she never gained the opportunity to appear at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] or the [[New York Metropolitan Opera]].\n\nShe was born '''Florence Mary Wilson''', but adopted the professional surname '''Austral''' in 1921 in honour of her homeland of Australia.<ref>As was the case with Elsie Mary Fischer, who took the name [[Elsa Stralia]] [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120133b.htm]; also, Helen Porter Mitchell took the name [[Nellie Melba]] (after [[Melbourne]]), and June Mary Gough took the name [[June Bronhill]] (after [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]]).</ref> She was considered to have few equals in sheer vocal quality until the arrival of [[Kirsten Flagstad]].

Edward Sugden]] at the Wesleyan [[Methodist Church]] in Palmerston Street, Carlton, [[Melbourne]] (now Church of All Nations). In 1914, she won first prizes in both the soprano and [[mezzo-soprano]] categories at a singing contest in [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], obtaining a scholarship which enabled her to continue her studies with [[Elise Wiedermann]]. She went to New York in 1919 to study further with Gabriele Sibella. Her voice impressed influential listeners and she was offered a contract to sing at the Metropolitan Opera; but she declined the Met offer to gain stage experience in England, and never again had a chance to sing with the New York company.\n\nAustral duly went to London where she was promoted by the leading British [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] of the day, [[Robert Radford]]. She made her Covent Garden debut on 16 May 1922 as Br\u00fcnnhilde in Wagner's ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'', and later in the same role in ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''. She shared this role with [[Frida Leider]], who received greater acclaim due to her superior acting skills. Austral's other roles at Covent Garden included ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Isolde]]'' and the title role in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]''.\n\nIn 1923, Austral appeared with Dame [[Nellie Melba]], who called her, \"One of the wonder voices of the world\", praising the purity of her tone and the gleaming power of her high notes. Unfortunately for her career, due to prevailing circumstances and the reputed antipathy of conductor [[Bruno Walter]], she ended up singing more with the [[British National Opera Company]] than at Covent Garden in the 1920s.\n\nDuring the mid-1920s she made the first of more than 100 recordings for [[HMV]], which are still treasured by music-lovers and collectors. The famous recording engineer and producer at HMV, [[Fred Gaisberg]], said: \"In the early twenties Florence Austral was the most important recording artist we had, thanks to the beauty, power and compass of her voice\". She recorded operatic arias as well as songs, sacred music and oratorio extracts. She can be heard, too, in superb duets opposite [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Miguel Fleta]], [[Tudor Davies]] and [[Walter Widdop]] that employ both the acoustic and electrical recording processes. (Her acoustic recordings for HMV include the pioneering, English-language series of excerpts from ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring Cycle]]''.)\n\nIn 1925, Austral became the second wife of the Australian flautist [[John Amadio]], and they toured widely together in America, Europe and Australia. She often sang in the Ring operas in [[Philadelphia]], and in concert under the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]]. However, she never appeared at [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]], or at the [[Vienna State Opera]]. She was negotiating to sing in Vienna, but this did not eventuate.\n\nAustral, however, did become a principal singer with the esteemed [[Berlin State Opera]] in 1930. It was there in that same year that she showed the first signs of [[multiple sclerosis]], which manifested themselves on stage during a performance of ''Die Walk\u00fcre'' opposite [[bass-baritone]] [[Friedrich Schorr]]. Her opera career gradually suffered as a result of the advance of this debilitating disease, but she was still able to devote herself to concert and recital work, developing a large lieder repertoire, although she also sang operatic pieces. Her appearances in opera during this time included ones in her home country, Australia, where she toured with tenor Walter Widdop in 1934\u201335, singing the Australian premiere of [[Les p\u00eacheurs de perles]].\n\nShe returned to Britain in 1939, and appeared in many benefit concerts during the early part of [[World War II]], before her illness forced her to retire in 1940. In 1946 she returned to Australia. Many of her possessions were lost in a fire. Royalty earnings from her recordings had declined, too, and she found herself in need of an income, so she taught singing at the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] Conservatorium (now part of the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia) from 1954 until her retirement in 1959.\n\n==Death==\nAustral gave a few newspaper interviews in her retirement. She died of [[cerebrovascular disease]] in a church home for the aged at [[Mayfield, New South Wales|Mayfield, Newcastle]], on 15 May 1968.<ref name=\"adob\"/> By general critical consent, she remains the finest dramatic soprano ever produced by Australia, as her various recordings, now available on CD reissues, readily attest.\n\n===Tributes===\n:''The Waters of the Rhine seem to mount high, and over all rides the triumphant voice of Florence Austral as Brunnhilde. Her singing can justly be called queenly. Even after hearing the glorious singing of Frida Leider on other records, Austral's triumphant voice remains in the mind.''\n::::Neville Cardus, ''Manchester Guardian'', 1928.\n\n:\"In the early twenties Florence Austral was the most important recording artist we had, thanks to the beauty, power and compass of her voice.\" -- Fred Gaisberg, HMV (later EMI)\n\n==References==\n*Elphinstone, Michael and Wayne Hancock, ''When Austral Sang: the Biography of Florence Austral'', Hyde Park Press, Richmond, South Australia, 2005, 655pp. {{ISBN|0-646-44033-0}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;page=0;query=Person%3A%22%2FPerson%2Fkey%2F30198-1%22;resCount=10 Florence Austral Collection] at the [[National Film and Sound Archive]], includes sound recordings, photographs, programs, recording notes, scripts etc.\n* [http://www.theartscentre.com.au/discover/collections-and-research/performing-arts-collection-directory/opera-collection.aspx?view=list&filter=-1&page=1#listing Florence Austral Collection] in the Performing Arts Collection, the Arts Centre, Melbourne (news clippings, photographs, programmes etc.)\n* [http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A574828%20|%20Number%3A574827%20Online%3Atrue;querytype=;rec=1;resCount=10 Listen to the Last Rose of Summer at the National Film and Sound Archive]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Austral, Florence}}\n[[Category:1892 births]]\n[[Category:1968 deaths]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Australian operatic sopranos]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century opera singers]]\n[[Category:20th-century women opera singers]]\n", "name_user": "Chris.sherlock", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove bolding", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Austral"}
