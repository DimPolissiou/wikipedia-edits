For example, \"How can Bob send a private message M to Alice in a public-key cryptosystem?\"<ref name=\":0\" /> is believed to be easier to describe and understand than \"How can B send a private message M to A in a public-key cryptosystem?\"\n\nIn [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]], Alice and Bob are used extensively as participants in discussions about cryptographic [[protocol (cryptography)|protocols]] or systems. The names are conventional, and other than Alice and Bob often use a [[Rhyme|rhyming]] [[mnemonic]] to associate the name with the typical role of that person.\n\n== History ==\nThe first mention of Alice and Bob in the context of cryptography was in Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman's 1978 article \"A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> They wrote, \"For our scenarios we suppose that A and B (also known as Alice and Bob) are two users of a public-key cryptosystem\".<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|121}} Previous to this article, cryptographers typically referred to message senders and receivers as A and B, or other simple symbols. In fact, in the two previous articles by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, introducing the [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA cryptosystem]], there is no mention of Alice and Bob.<ref>Rivest, R. L., A. Shamir, and L. Adleman. \u201cOn Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems.\u201d Cambridge MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, April 1977.</ref><ref>Rivest, R. L., A. Shamir, and L.

Cryptographers would often begin their academic papers with reference to Alice and Bob. For instance, [[Michael O. Rabin|Michael Rabin]] began his 1981 paper, \"Bob and Alice each have a secret, SB and SA, respectively, which they want to exchange.\"<ref>Rabin, Michael O. ''How to exchange secrets with oblivious transfer''.

In 1983, Blum invented a backstory about a troubled relationship between Alice and Bob, writing, \"Alice and Bob, recently divorced, mutually distrustful, still do business together. They live on opposite coasts, communicate mainly by telephone, and use their computers to transact business over the telephone.\"<ref>Blum, Manuel. \u201cHow to Exchange (Secret) Keys.\u201d ''ACM Trans.

The first to be added was Eve, the \"eavesdropper.\" Eve was invented in 1988 by Charles Bennet, Gilles Brassard, and Jean-Marc Robert, in their paper, \"Privacy Amplification by Public Discussion.\"<ref>Bennett, Charles H., Gilles Brassard, and Jean-Marc Robert. \u201cPrivacy Amplification by Public Discussion.\u201d ''SIAM Journal on Computing'' 17, no. 2 (April 1988): 210\u201329. {{doi|10.1137/0217014}}.</ref> In [[Bruce Schneier]]'s book ''Applied Cryptography'', other characters are listed.<ref>Schneier, Bruce.

However, internal power struggles following the death of King Rumanyika I in 1881 destabilized the kingdom and, with the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|1890s rinderpest epizootic]] killing upwards of 90% of Karagwe's cattle population, the kingdom went into a decline from which it was never able to fully recover.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> It was around this time the [[German East Africa|Germans]] entered the region, whose interests were peaked due to news reports from [[John Hanning Speke|Speke]], [[James Augustus Grant|Grant]], and [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley's]] travels. Rather than establish a colonial government, the Germans chose to have a privately sponsored colonialist company, the [[Society for German Colonization]].

This line placed Buganda under British influence and Buhaya under German influence. In 1902, the southern portion of Buganda known as Missenye was ceded, becoming its own separate kingdom under German rule.<ref name=\":13\" /> The Germans referred to Kagera Region as ''Zwischenseengebiet'' (inter-lake area) and included Rwanda and Burundi.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=J|last2=Hall|first2=R. de Z.|date=1946|title=The History of Karagwe (Bukoba District)|url=|journal=Tanganyika Notes and Records|volume=24|pages=3\u201327|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1890, the Germans arrived in [[Bukoba]] under the command of [[Emin Pasha]].

It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of [[pressure]] differences arising from natural forces. There are two types of natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] occurring in buildings: ''wind driven ventilation'' and ''buoyancy-driven ventilation''. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.<ref name=Linden>{{Cite journal | last1 = Linden | first1 = P.

Differences in static pressure arise from global and [[microclimate]] thermal phenomena and create the air flow we call [[wind]]. [[Dynamic pressure]] is the pressure exerted when the wind comes into contact with an object such as a hill or a building and it is described by the following equation:<ref>{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L.J.|title=Aerodynamics|year=1975|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n:<math>q = \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, v^{2},</math>\n\nwhere (using [[International System of Units|SI]] units):\n\n:{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n| <math>q\\;</math>    || = dynamic [[pressure]] in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]],\n|-\n| <math>\\rho\\;</math> || = fluid [[density]] in kg/m<sup>3</sup> (e.g. [[density of air]]),\n|-\n| <math>v\\;</math>    || = fluid [[velocity]] in m/s.\n|}\n\nThe impact of wind on a building affects the ventilation and [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates through it and the associated heat losses or heat gains. Wind speed increases with height and is lower towards the ground due to frictional drag.\n\nThe impact of wind on the building form creates areas of positive pressure on the [[windward]] side of a building and negative pressure on the [[leeward]] and sides of the building. Thus, the building shape and local wind patterns are crucial in creating the wind pressures that will drive air flow through its apertures. In practical terms wind pressure will vary considerably creating complex air flows and turbulence by its interaction with elements of the natural environment (trees, hills) and urban context (buildings, structures). Vernacular and traditional buildings in different climatic regions rely heavily upon natural ventilation for maintaining [[thermal comfort]] conditions in the enclosed spaces. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Design==\nDesign guidelines are offered in [[Building code|building regulations]] and other related literature and include a variety of recommendations on many specific areas such as:\n* Building location and orientation\n* Building form and dimensions\n* Indoor partitions and layout\n* [[Window]] typologies, operation, location, and shapes\n* Other aperture types ([[door]]s, [[chimney]]s)\n* Construction methods and detailing (infiltration)\n* External elements (walls, screens)\n* [[Urban planning]] conditions\n\nThe following design guidelines are selected from the [[Whole Building Design Guide]], a program of the [[National Institute of Building Sciences]]:<ref name=WBDG>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Natural Ventilation|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/naturalventilation.php|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences}}</ref>\n* Maximize wind-induced ventilation by siting the ridge of a building perpendicular to the summer winds\n* Widths of naturally ventilated zone should be narrow (max 13.7 m [45 feet])\n* Each room should have two separate supply and exhaust openings.

Wind driven ventilation depends on wind behavior, on the interactions with the building envelope and on openings or other air exchange devices such as inlets or chimneys. For a simple volume with two openings, the cross wind flow rate can be calculated using the following equation:<ref name=\"ASHRAE Handbook\">{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook|year=2009|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}</ref>\n\n<math>Q = U_{\\textrm{wind}}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{\\textrm{p1}}-C_{\\textrm{p2}}}{1/\\left(A_{\\textrm{1}}^2C_{\\textrm{1}}^2\\right)+1/\\left(A_{\\textrm{2}}^2C_{\\textrm{2}}^2\\right)}}\\qquad{}\\left(1\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>U_{\\textrm{wind}}</math> is the far-field wind speed; <math>C_{\\textrm{p1}}</math> is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the upstream opening; <math>C_{\\textrm{p2}}</math> is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the downstream opening; <math>A_{\\textrm{1}}</math> is the cross-sectional area of the upstream opening; <math>A_{\\textrm{2}}</math> is the cross-sectional area of the downstream opening; <math>C_{\\textrm{1}}</math> is the discharge coefficient of the upstream opening; and <math>C_{\\textrm{2}}</math> is the discharge coefficient of the downstream opening.\n\nFor rooms with single opening, the calculation of ventilation rate is more complicated than cross-ventilation due to the bi-directional flow and strong turbulent effect. The ventilation rate for single-sided ventilation can be accurately predicted by combining different models for mean flow, pulsating flow and eddy penetration.<ref name=\"H. Wang & Q.

As we can see in the equation (1), the air exchange depends linearly on the wind speed in the urban place where the architectural project will be built. CFD ([[Computational Fluid Dynamics]]) tools and zonal modelings are usually used to design naturally ventilated buildings. [[Windcatcher]]s are able to aid wind driven ventilation by directing air in and out of buildings.\n\nSome of the important limitations of wind driven ventilation:\n* Unpredictability and difficulties in harnessing due to speed and direction variations\n* The [[Indoor air quality|quality of air]] it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area\n* May create a strong draught, discomfort.\n\n==Buoyancy-driven ventilation==\n::''(For more details on displacement buoyancy-driven ventilation (rather than mixing type buoyancy-driven ventilation), see [[Stack effect]])''\n\nBuoyancy driven ventilation arise due to differences in density of interior and exterior air, which in large part arises from differences in temperature. When there is a temperature difference between two adjoining volumes of air the warmer air will have lower density and be more buoyant thus will rise above the cold air creating an upward air stream. Forced upflow buoyancy driven ventilation in a building takes place in a traditional fireplace. Passive stack ventilators are common in most bathrooms and other type of spaces without direct access to the outdoors.\n\nIn order for a building to be ventilated adequately via buoyancy driven ventilation, the inside and outside temperatures must be different. When the interior is warmer than the exterior, indoor air rises and escapes the building at higher apertures. If there are lower apertures then colder, denser air from the exterior enters the building through them, thereby creating upflow displacement ventilation. However, if there are no lower apertures present, then both in- and out-flow will occur through the high level opening. This is called mixing ventilation. This latter strategy still results in fresh air reaching to low level, since although the incoming cold air will mix with the interior air, it will always be more dense than the bulk interior air and hence fall to the floor. Buoyancy-driven ventilation increases with greater temperature difference, and increased height between the higher and lower apertures in the case of displacement ventilation. When both high and low level openings are present, the neutral plane in a building occurs at the location between the high and low openings at which the internal pressure will be the same as the external pressure (in the absence of wind). Above the neutral plane, the internal air pressure will be positive and air will flow out of any intermediate level apertures created. Below the neutral plane the internal air pressure will be negative and external air will be drawn into the space through any intermediate level apertures. Buoyancy-driven ventilation has several significant benefits: {See Linden, P Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 1999}\n* Does not rely on wind: can take place on still, hot summer days when it is most needed.\n* Stable air flow (compared to wind)\n* Greater control in choosing areas of air intake\n* Sustainable method\n\nLimitations of buoyancy-driven ventilation:\n* Lower magnitude compared to wind ventilation on the windiest days\n* Relies on temperature differences (inside/outside)\n* Design restrictions (height, location of apertures) and may incur extra costs (ventilator stacks, taller spaces)\n* The quality of air it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area (although this can also be a factor in wind-driven ventilation)\n\nNatural ventilation in buildings can rely mostly on wind pressure differences in windy conditions, but buoyancy effects can a) augment this type of ventilation and b) ensure air flow rates during still days. Buoyancy-driven ventilation can be implemented in ways that air inflow in the building does not rely solely on wind direction. In this respect, it may provide improved air quality in some types of polluted environments such as cities. For example, air can be drawn through the backside or courtyards of buildings avoiding the direct pollution and noise of the street facade. Wind can augment the buoyancy effect, but can also reduce its effect depending on its speed, direction and the design of air inlets and outlets. Therefore, prevailing winds must be taken into account when designing for stack effect ventilation.\n\n==Estimating buoyancy-driven ventilation==\nThe natural ventilation flow rate for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation with vents at two different heights can be estimated with this equation:<ref name=\"ASHRAE Handbook\" />\n\n:<math>Q_{S} = C_{d}\\; A\\; \\sqrt {2\\;g\\;H_{d}\\;\\frac{T_I-T_O}{T_I}}</math>\n\n:'''[[English units]]:'''\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right| ''Q<sub>S</sub>''\n|align=left|= Buoyancy-driven ventilation airflow rate, ft\u00b3/s\n|-\n!align=right| ''A''\n|align=left|= cross-sectional area of opening, ft\u00b2 (assumes equal area for inlet and outlet) \n|-\n!align=right| ''C<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Discharge coefficient for opening (typical value is 0.65)\n|-\n!align=right| ''g''\n|align=left|= [[gravitational acceleration]], around 32.2&nbsp;ft/s\u00b2 on Earth\n|-\n!align=right| ''H<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Height from midpoint of lower opening to midpoint of upper opening, ft\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>I</sub>''\n|align=left|= Average indoor temperature between the inlet and outlet, [[Rankine scale|\u00b0R]]\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>O</sub>''\n|align=left|= Outdoor temperature, \u00b0R\n|}\n\n:'''[[SI units]]:'''\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right| ''Q<sub>S</sub>''\n|align=left|= Buoyancy-driven ventilation airflow rate, m\u00b3/s\n|-\n!align=right| ''A''\n|align=left|= cross-sectional area of opening, m\u00b2 (assumes equal area for inlet and outlet) \n|-\n!align=right| ''C<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Discharge coefficient for opening (typical value is 0,62)\n|-\n!align=right| ''g''\n|align=left|= [[gravitational acceleration]], around 9.81&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 on Earth\n|-\n!align=right| ''H<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Height from midpoint of lower opening to midpoint of upper opening, m\n|-\n|align=left|\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>I</sub>''\n|align=left|= Average indoor temperature between the inlet and outlet, [[Kelvin|K]]\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>O</sub>''\n|align=left|= Outdoor temperature, K\n|}\n\n==Assessing performance==\nOne way to measure the performance of a naturally ventilated space is to measure the [[air changes per hour]] in an interior space.  In order for ventilation to be effective, there must be exchange between outdoor air and room air.  A common method for measuring ventilation effectiveness is to use a [[tracer gas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McWilliams|first=Jennifer|title=Review of air flow measurement techniques. LBNL Paper LBNL-49747.|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7532b84f?query=Review%20of%20air%20flow%20measurement%20techniques|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|year=2002}}</ref>  The first step is to close all windows, doors, and openings in the space. Then a tracer gas is added to the air. The reference, [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection.<ref name=\"ASTM Standard E741\">{{cite journal|title=ASTM Standard E741-11: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution|year=2006|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA}}</ref>  Once the tracer gas has been added, mixing fans can be used to distribute the tracer gas as uniformly as possible throughout the space.  To do a decay test, the concentration of the tracer gas is first measured when the concentration of the tracer gas is constant.  Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the tracer gas in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the tracer gas.  The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the tracer gas over time.  For further details on this test method, refer to ASTM Standard E741.<ref name=\"ASTM Standard E741\"/>\n\nWhile natural ventilation eliminates electrical energy consumed by fans, overall energy consumption of natural ventilation systems is often higher than that of modern mechanical ventilation systems featuring [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery]]. Typical modern mechanical ventilation systems use as little as 2000 J/m3 for fan operation, and in cold weather they can recover much more energy than this in the form of heat transferred from waste exhaust air to fresh supply air using [[recuperator]]s.\n\nVentilation heat loss can be calculated as: theta=Cp*rho*dT*(1-eta).\n\nWhere:\n\nTheta is ventilation heat loss in W\n\nCp is specific heat capacity of air (~1000 J/(kg*K))\n\nRho is air density (~1.2&nbsp;kg/m3)\n\ndT is the temperature difference between inside and outside air in \u00b0K or \u00b0C\n\nEta is the heat recovery efficiency - (typically around 0.8 with heat recovery and 0 if no heat recovery device is used).\n\nThe temperature differential needed between indoor and outdoor air for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to outperform natural ventilation in terms of overall energy efficiency can therefore be calculated as:\n\ndT=SFP/(Cp*Rho*(1-eta))\n\nWhere:\n\nSFP is specific fan power in Pa, J/m^3, or W/(m^3/s)\n\nUnder typical comfort ventilation conditions with a heat recovery efficiency of 80% and a SFP of 2000 J/m3 we get:\n\ndT=2000/(1000*1.2*(1-0.8))=8.33 K\n\nIn climates where the mean absolute difference between inside and outside temperatures exceeds ~10K the energy conservation argument for choosing natural over mechanical ventilation might therefore be questioned. It should however be noted that heating energy might be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than electricity. This is especially the case in areas where [[district heating]] is available.\n\nTo develop natural ventilation systems with heat recovery two inherent challenges must first be solved:\n\n# Providing efficient heat recovery at very low driving pressures.\n# Physically or thermally connecting supply and exhaust air streams. (Stack ventilation typically relies on supply and exhaust being placed low and high respectively, while wind driven natural ventilation normally relies on openings being placed on opposing sides of a building for efficient cross ventilation.)\n\nResearch aiming at the development of natural ventilation systems featuring heat recovery have been made as early as 1993 where Shultz et al.<ref name=\":0\">Schultz, J. M., 1993. Naturlig ventilation med varmegenvinding, Lyngby: Laboratoriet for Varmeisolering, DTH. (Danish)</ref> proposed and tested a chimney type design relying on stack effect while recovering heat using a large counterflow recuperator constructed from corrugated galvanized iron. Both supply and exhaust happened through an unconditioned attic space, with exhaust air being extracted at ceiling height and air being supplied at floor level through a vertical duct.\n\nThe device was found to provide sufficient ventilation air flow for a single family home and heat recovery with an efficiency around 40%. The device was however found to be too large and heavy to be practical, and the heat recovery efficiency too low to be competitive with mechanical systems of the time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLater attempts have primarily focused on wind as the main driving force due to its higher pressure potential. This however introduces an issue of there being large fluctuations in driving pressure.\n\nWith the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.<ref>Calautit, J.

While these tests have been somewhat successful, liquid coupling introduces mechanical pumps that consume energy to circulate the working fluid.<ref>Hviid, C. A. & Svendsen, S., 2008.

[[Dynamic pressure]] is the pressure exerted when the wind comes into contact with an object such as a hill or a building and it is described by the following equation:<ref>{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L.J.|title=Aerodynamics|year=1975|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n:<math>q = \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, v^{2},</math>\n\nwhere (using [[International System of Units|SI]] units):\n\n:{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n| <math>q\\;</math>    || = dynamic [[pressure]] in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]],\n|-\n| <math>\\rho\\;</math> || = fluid [[density]] in kg/m<sup>3</sup> (e.g. [[density of air]]),\n|-\n| <math>v\\;</math>    || = fluid [[velocity]] in m/s.\n|}\n\nThe impact of wind on a building affects the ventilation and [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates through it and the associated heat losses or heat gains. Wind speed increases with height and is lower towards the ground due to frictional drag.\n\nThe impact of wind on the building form creates areas of positive pressure on the [[windward]] side of a building and negative pressure on the [[leeward]] and sides of the building. Thus, the building shape and local wind patterns are crucial in creating the wind pressures that will drive air flow through its apertures. In practical terms wind pressure will vary considerably creating complex air flows and turbulence by its interaction with elements of the natural environment (trees, hills) and urban context (buildings, structures). Vernacular and traditional buildings in different climatic regions rely heavily upon natural ventilation for maintaining [[thermal comfort]] conditions in the enclosed spaces. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Design==\nDesign guidelines are offered in [[Building code|building regulations]] and other related literature and include a variety of recommendations on many specific areas such as:\n* Building location and orientation\n* Building form and dimensions\n* Indoor partitions and layout\n* [[Window]] typologies, operation, location, and shapes\n* Other aperture types ([[door]]s, [[chimney]]s)\n* Construction methods and detailing (infiltration)\n* External elements (walls, screens)\n* [[Urban planning]] conditions\n\nThe following design guidelines are selected from the [[Whole Building Design Guide]], a program of the [[National Institute of Building Sciences]]:<ref name=WBDG>{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Natural Ventilation|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/naturalventilation.php|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences}}</ref>\n* Maximize wind-induced ventilation by siting the ridge of a building perpendicular to the summer winds\n* Widths of naturally ventilated zone should be narrow (max 13.7 m [45 feet])\n* Each room should have two separate supply and exhaust openings.

Orient windows across the room and offset from each other to maximize mixing within the room while minimizing the obstructions to airflow within the room.\n* Window openings should be operable by the occupants\n* Consider the use of clerestories or vented skylights.\n\n==Wind driven ventilation==\nWind driven ventilation can be classified as cross ventilation and single-sided ventilation. Wind driven ventilation depends on wind behavior, on the interactions with the building envelope and on openings or other air exchange devices such as inlets or chimneys. For a simple volume with two openings, the cross wind flow rate can be calculated using the following equation:<ref name=\"ASHRAE Handbook\">{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook|year=2009|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}</ref>\n\n<math>Q = U_{\\textrm{wind}}\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{\\textrm{p1}}-C_{\\textrm{p2}}}{1/\\left(A_{\\textrm{1}}^2C_{\\textrm{1}}^2\\right)+1/\\left(A_{\\textrm{2}}^2C_{\\textrm{2}}^2\\right)}}\\qquad{}\\left(1\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>U_{\\textrm{wind}}</math> is the far-field wind speed; <math>C_{\\textrm{p1}}</math> is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the upstream opening; <math>C_{\\textrm{p2}}</math> is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the downstream opening; <math>A_{\\textrm{1}}</math> is the cross-sectional area of the upstream opening; <math>A_{\\textrm{2}}</math> is the cross-sectional area of the downstream opening; <math>C_{\\textrm{1}}</math> is the discharge coefficient of the upstream opening; and <math>C_{\\textrm{2}}</math> is the discharge coefficient of the downstream opening.\n\nFor rooms with single opening, the calculation of ventilation rate is more complicated than cross-ventilation due to the bi-directional flow and strong turbulent effect. The ventilation rate for single-sided ventilation can be accurately predicted by combining different models for mean flow, pulsating flow and eddy penetration.<ref name=\"H. Wang & Q.

As we can see in the equation (1), the air exchange depends linearly on the wind speed in the urban place where the architectural project will be built. CFD ([[Computational Fluid Dynamics]]) tools and zonal modelings are usually used to design naturally ventilated buildings. [[Windcatcher]]s are able to aid wind driven ventilation by directing air in and out of buildings.\n\nSome of the important limitations of wind driven ventilation:\n* Unpredictability and difficulties in harnessing due to speed and direction variations\n* The [[Indoor air quality|quality of air]] it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area\n* May create a strong draught, discomfort.\n\n==Buoyancy-driven ventilation==\n::''(For more details on displacement buoyancy-driven ventilation (rather than mixing type buoyancy-driven ventilation), see [[Stack effect]])''\n\nBuoyancy driven ventilation arise due to differences in density of interior and exterior air, which in large part arises from differences in temperature. When there is a temperature difference between two adjoining volumes of air the warmer air will have lower density and be more buoyant thus will rise above the cold air creating an upward air stream. Forced upflow buoyancy driven ventilation in a building takes place in a traditional fireplace. Passive stack ventilators are common in most bathrooms and other type of spaces without direct access to the outdoors.\n\nIn order for a building to be ventilated adequately via buoyancy driven ventilation, the inside and outside temperatures must be different. When the interior is warmer than the exterior, indoor air rises and escapes the building at higher apertures. If there are lower apertures then colder, denser air from the exterior enters the building through them, thereby creating upflow displacement ventilation. However, if there are no lower apertures present, then both in- and out-flow will occur through the high level opening. This is called mixing ventilation. This latter strategy still results in fresh air reaching to low level, since although the incoming cold air will mix with the interior air, it will always be more dense than the bulk interior air and hence fall to the floor. Buoyancy-driven ventilation increases with greater temperature difference, and increased height between the higher and lower apertures in the case of displacement ventilation. When both high and low level openings are present, the neutral plane in a building occurs at the location between the high and low openings at which the internal pressure will be the same as the external pressure (in the absence of wind). Above the neutral plane, the internal air pressure will be positive and air will flow out of any intermediate level apertures created. Below the neutral plane the internal air pressure will be negative and external air will be drawn into the space through any intermediate level apertures. Buoyancy-driven ventilation has several significant benefits: {See Linden, P Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 1999}\n* Does not rely on wind: can take place on still, hot summer days when it is most needed.\n* Stable air flow (compared to wind)\n* Greater control in choosing areas of air intake\n* Sustainable method\n\nLimitations of buoyancy-driven ventilation:\n* Lower magnitude compared to wind ventilation on the windiest days\n* Relies on temperature differences (inside/outside)\n* Design restrictions (height, location of apertures) and may incur extra costs (ventilator stacks, taller spaces)\n* The quality of air it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area (although this can also be a factor in wind-driven ventilation)\n\nNatural ventilation in buildings can rely mostly on wind pressure differences in windy conditions, but buoyancy effects can a) augment this type of ventilation and b) ensure air flow rates during still days. Buoyancy-driven ventilation can be implemented in ways that air inflow in the building does not rely solely on wind direction. In this respect, it may provide improved air quality in some types of polluted environments such as cities. For example, air can be drawn through the backside or courtyards of buildings avoiding the direct pollution and noise of the street facade. Wind can augment the buoyancy effect, but can also reduce its effect depending on its speed, direction and the design of air inlets and outlets. Therefore, prevailing winds must be taken into account when designing for stack effect ventilation.\n\n==Estimating buoyancy-driven ventilation==\nThe natural ventilation flow rate for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation with vents at two different heights can be estimated with this equation:<ref name=\"ASHRAE Handbook\" />\n\n:<math>Q_{S} = C_{d}\\; A\\; \\sqrt {2\\;g\\;H_{d}\\;\\frac{T_I-T_O}{T_I}}</math>\n\n:'''[[English units]]:'''\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right| ''Q<sub>S</sub>''\n|align=left|= Buoyancy-driven ventilation airflow rate, ft\u00b3/s\n|-\n!align=right| ''A''\n|align=left|= cross-sectional area of opening, ft\u00b2 (assumes equal area for inlet and outlet) \n|-\n!align=right| ''C<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Discharge coefficient for opening (typical value is 0.65)\n|-\n!align=right| ''g''\n|align=left|= [[gravitational acceleration]], around 32.2&nbsp;ft/s\u00b2 on Earth\n|-\n!align=right| ''H<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Height from midpoint of lower opening to midpoint of upper opening, ft\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>I</sub>''\n|align=left|= Average indoor temperature between the inlet and outlet, [[Rankine scale|\u00b0R]]\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>O</sub>''\n|align=left|= Outdoor temperature, \u00b0R\n|}\n\n:'''[[SI units]]:'''\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right| ''Q<sub>S</sub>''\n|align=left|= Buoyancy-driven ventilation airflow rate, m\u00b3/s\n|-\n!align=right| ''A''\n|align=left|= cross-sectional area of opening, m\u00b2 (assumes equal area for inlet and outlet) \n|-\n!align=right| ''C<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Discharge coefficient for opening (typical value is 0,62)\n|-\n!align=right| ''g''\n|align=left|= [[gravitational acceleration]], around 9.81&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 on Earth\n|-\n!align=right| ''H<sub>d</sub>''\n|align=left|= Height from midpoint of lower opening to midpoint of upper opening, m\n|-\n|align=left|\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>I</sub>''\n|align=left|= Average indoor temperature between the inlet and outlet, [[Kelvin|K]]\n|-\n!align=right| ''T<sub>O</sub>''\n|align=left|= Outdoor temperature, K\n|}\n\n==Assessing performance==\nOne way to measure the performance of a naturally ventilated space is to measure the [[air changes per hour]] in an interior space.  In order for ventilation to be effective, there must be exchange between outdoor air and room air.  A common method for measuring ventilation effectiveness is to use a [[tracer gas]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McWilliams|first=Jennifer|title=Review of air flow measurement techniques. LBNL Paper LBNL-49747.|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7532b84f?query=Review%20of%20air%20flow%20measurement%20techniques|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|year=2002}}</ref>  The first step is to close all windows, doors, and openings in the space. Then a tracer gas is added to the air. The reference, [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection.<ref name=\"ASTM Standard E741\">{{cite journal|title=ASTM Standard E741-11: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution|year=2006|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA}}</ref>  Once the tracer gas has been added, mixing fans can be used to distribute the tracer gas as uniformly as possible throughout the space.  To do a decay test, the concentration of the tracer gas is first measured when the concentration of the tracer gas is constant.  Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the tracer gas in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the tracer gas.  The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the tracer gas over time.  For further details on this test method, refer to ASTM Standard E741.<ref name=\"ASTM Standard E741\"/>\n\nWhile natural ventilation eliminates electrical energy consumed by fans, overall energy consumption of natural ventilation systems is often higher than that of modern mechanical ventilation systems featuring [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery]]. Typical modern mechanical ventilation systems use as little as 2000 J/m3 for fan operation, and in cold weather they can recover much more energy than this in the form of heat transferred from waste exhaust air to fresh supply air using [[recuperator]]s.\n\nVentilation heat loss can be calculated as: theta=Cp*rho*dT*(1-eta).\n\nWhere:\n\nTheta is ventilation heat loss in W\n\nCp is specific heat capacity of air (~1000 J/(kg*K))\n\nRho is air density (~1.2&nbsp;kg/m3)\n\ndT is the temperature difference between inside and outside air in \u00b0K or \u00b0C\n\nEta is the heat recovery efficiency - (typically around 0.8 with heat recovery and 0 if no heat recovery device is used).\n\nThe temperature differential needed between indoor and outdoor air for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to outperform natural ventilation in terms of overall energy efficiency can therefore be calculated as:\n\ndT=SFP/(Cp*Rho*(1-eta))\n\nWhere:\n\nSFP is specific fan power in Pa, J/m^3, or W/(m^3/s)\n\nUnder typical comfort ventilation conditions with a heat recovery efficiency of 80% and a SFP of 2000 J/m3 we get:\n\ndT=2000/(1000*1.2*(1-0.8))=8.33 K\n\nIn climates where the mean absolute difference between inside and outside temperatures exceeds ~10K the energy conservation argument for choosing natural over mechanical ventilation might therefore be questioned. It should however be noted that heating energy might be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than electricity. This is especially the case in areas where [[district heating]] is available.\n\nTo develop natural ventilation systems with heat recovery two inherent challenges must first be solved:\n\n# Providing efficient heat recovery at very low driving pressures.\n# Physically or thermally connecting supply and exhaust air streams. (Stack ventilation typically relies on supply and exhaust being placed low and high respectively, while wind driven natural ventilation normally relies on openings being placed on opposing sides of a building for efficient cross ventilation.)\n\nResearch aiming at the development of natural ventilation systems featuring heat recovery have been made as early as 1993 where Shultz et al<ref name=\":0\">Schultz, J. M., 1993. Naturlig ventilation med varmegenvinding, Lyngby: Laboratoriet for Varmeisolering, DTH. (Danish)</ref> proposed and tested a chimney type design relying on stack effect while recovering heat using a large counterflow recuperator constructed from corrugated galvanized iron. Both supply and exhaust happened through an unconditioned attic space, with exhaust air being extracted at ceiling height and air being supplied at floor level through a vertical duct.\n\nThe device was found to provide sufficient ventilation air flow for a single family home and heat recovery with an efficiency around 40%. The device was however found to be too large and heavy to be practical, and the heat recovery efficiency too low to be competitive with mechanical systems of the time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLater attempts have primarily focused on wind as the main driving force due to its higher pressure potential. This however introduces an issue of there being large fluctuations in driving pressure.\n\nWith the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.<ref>Calautit, J.

AIVC, 477(12), pp. 57-62.</ref>\n\nLiquid coupled run around loops have also been tested to achieve indirect thermal connection between exhaust and supply air. While these tests have been somewhat successful, liquid coupling introduces mechanical pumps that consume energy to circulate the working fluid.<ref>Hviid, C. A. & Svendsen, S., 2008.

Formed in 2007, it consists of five Regular and three Reserve battalions, plus a number of companies in other Army Reserve battalions. Each battalion of The Rifles was formerly an individual battalion of one of the two [[large regiment]]s of the [[Light Division]] (with the exception of the 1st Battalion, which is an amalgamation of two individual regiments). Since formation the regiment has been involved in combat operations, first in the later stages of the [[Iraq War]] and in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==History==\nThe Rifles was created as a result of the [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|Future Army Structure]]. Under the original announcement, the Light Division would have remained essentially unchanged, with the exception of the [[Light Infantry]] gaining a new battalion through the amalgamation of two other regiments, and both gaining a reserve battalion from within the Territorial Army (TA) as it was then called. However, on 24 November 2005, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] announced that the four regiments would amalgamate into a single five-battalion regiment. The regular battalions of The Rifles was formed on 1 February 2007 by the amalgamation of the four Light Infantry and Rifle Regiments of the [[Light Division]] as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightinfantry.me.uk/therifles.htm|title=History of the Light Infantry|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 1st Battalion, [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]], and the 1st Battalion [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]) \n*2nd Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Green Jackets]])\n*3rd Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 2nd Battalion, [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]])\n*4th Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets)\n*5th Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 1st Battalion, Light Infantry)\n*6th Battalion (TA) The Rifles (formed from the [[Rifle Volunteers]])\n*7th Battalion (TA) The Rifles (formed from the [[Royal Rifle Volunteers]] minus the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]] Company but with the surviving two Companies (F and G) of 4th (V) and 5th (V) Battalions of the Royal Green Jackets within The [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]])\n\nThe Rifles was formed to serve as the county regiment of the following counties:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/26607.aspx|title=6 RIFLES|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/25678.aspx|title=7 RIFLES|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Berkshire]]\n*[[Buckinghamshire]]\n*[[Cornwall]]\n*[[Devon]]\n*[[Dorset]]\n*[[County Durham|Durham]]\n*[[Gloucestershire]]\n*[[Herefordshire]]\n*[[Oxfordshire]]\n*[[Shropshire]]\n*[[Somerset]]\n*[[South Yorkshire]]\n*[[Wiltshire]]\n{{div col end}}\nThe 2nd Battalion, the 3rd Battalion and the 4th Battalion were all deployed in [[Basra]] in [[Iraq]] during some of the worst fighting of the [[Iraq War]] including the withdrawal from Basra Palace in September 2007.<ref name=care>{{cite web|url=http://www.careforcasualties.org.uk/abouttherifles.html|title=The Rifles forged in battle - An overview of the first three years|publisher=Care for Casualties|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1st Battalion undertook a tour in [[Afghanistan]] between October 2008 and April 2009, ground holding and mentoring the [[Afghan National Army]] in [[Helmand Province]].<ref name=care/> The 5th Battalion was one of the last British Army units to leave Iraq in May 2009.<ref name=care/> The 4th Battalion provided reinforcement cover for the elections in Afghanistan and took part in [[Operation Panther's Claw]] in the Summer of 2009.<ref name=care/> At the same time the 2nd Battalion was deployed to [[Sangin]] and was relieved in due course by the 3rd Battalion.<ref name=care/> The 1st battalion returned to the Nahri Sarah District of Afghanistan in April 2011, to then be relieved by the 2nd and 5th battalions in October 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=20th Armoured Brigade takes command of Task Force Helmand|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/20thArmouredBrigadeTakesCommandOfTaskForceHelmand.htm|date=10 October 2011|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> In March 2018 the 2nd Battalion returned home after a six-month operational deployment to Iraq in support of [[Operation Shader]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Photos: Royal Reception as 2 Rifles Battalion return home from Iraq|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/photos-royal-reception-as-2-rifles-battalion-return-home-from-iraq-36688208.html|date=9 March 2018|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\nThe regiment has five regular and three reserve battalions, each configured for a specific infantry role:\n*'''1st Battalion''', an amalgamation of the 1st Battalion, [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]].

Formed in 2007, it consists of five Regular and three Reserve battalions, plus a number of companies in other Army Reserve battalions. Each battalion of The Rifles was formerly an individual battalion of one of the two [[large regiment]]s of the [[Light Division]] (with the exception of the 1st Battalion, which is an amalgamation of two individual regiments). Since formation the regiment has been involved in combat operations, first in the later stages of the [[Iraq War]] and in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==History==\nThe Rifles was created as a result of the [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|Future Army Structure]]. Under the original announcement, the Light Division would have remained essentially unchanged, with the exception of the [[Light Infantry]] gaining a new battalion through the amalgamation of two other regiments, and both gaining a reserve battalion from within the Territorial Army (TA) as it was then called. However, on 24 November 2005, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] announced that the four regiments would amalgamate into a single five-battalion regiment. The regular battalions of The Rifles was formed on 1 February 2007 by the amalgamation of the four Light Infantry and Rifle Regiments of the [[Light Division]] as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightinfantry.me.uk/therifles.htm|title=History of the Light Infantry|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 1st Battalion, [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]], and the 1st Battalion [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]]) \n*2nd Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Green Jackets]])\n*3rd Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 2nd Battalion, [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]])\n*4th Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets)\n*5th Battalion The Rifles (formed from the 1st Battalion, Light Infantry)\n*6th Battalion (TA) The Rifles (formed from the [[Rifle Volunteers]])\n*7th Battalion (TA) The Rifles (formed from the [[Royal Rifle Volunteers]] minus the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]] Company but with the surviving two Companies (F and G) of 4th (V) and 5th (V) Battalions of the Royal Green Jackets within The [[London Regiment (1993)|London Regiment]])\n\nThe Rifles was formed to serve as the county regiment of the following counties:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/26607.aspx|title=6 RIFLES|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/regiments/25678.aspx|title=7 RIFLES|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Berkshire]]\n*[[Buckinghamshire]]\n*[[Cornwall]]\n*[[Devon]]\n*[[Dorset]]\n*[[County Durham|Durham]]\n*[[Gloucestershire]]\n*[[Herefordshire]]\n*[[Oxfordshire]]\n*[[Shropshire]]\n*[[Somerset]]\n*[[South Yorkshire]]\n*[[Wiltshire]]\n{{div col end}}\nThe 2nd Battalion, the 3rd Battalion and the 4th Battalion were all deployed in [[Basra]] in [[Iraq]] during some of the worst fighting of the [[Iraq War]] including the withdrawal from Basra Palace in September 2007.<ref name=care>{{cite web|url=http://www.careforcasualties.org.uk/abouttherifles.html|title=The Rifles forged in battle - An overview of the first three years|publisher=Care for Casualties|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1st Battalion undertook a tour in [[Afghanistan]] between October 2008 and April 2009, ground holding and mentoring the [[Afghan National Army]] in [[Helmand Province]].<ref name=care/> The 5th Battalion was one of the last British Army units to leave Iraq in May 2009.<ref name=care/> The 4th Battalion provided reinforcement cover for the elections in Afghanistan and took part in [[Operation Panther's Claw]] in the Summer of 2009.<ref name=care/> At the same time the 2nd Battalion was deployed to [[Sangin]] and was relieved in due course by the 3rd Battalion.<ref name=care/> The 1st battalion returned to the Nahri Sarah District of Afghanistan in April 2011, to then be relieved by the 2nd and 5th battalions in October 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=20th Armoured Brigade takes command of Task Force Helmand|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/20thArmouredBrigadeTakesCommandOfTaskForceHelmand.htm|date=10 October 2011|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> In March 2018 the 2nd Battalion returned home after a six-month operational deployment to Iraq in support of [[Operation Shader]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Photos: Royal Reception as 2 Rifles Battalion return home from Iraq|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/photos-royal-reception-as-2-rifles-battalion-return-home-from-iraq-36688208.html|date=9 March 2018|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\nThe regiment has five regular and three reserve battalions, each configured for a specific infantry role:\n*'''1st Battalion''', an amalgamation of the 1st Battalion, [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]] and the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment]].

In between stints as host of ''High Rollers,'' Trebek hosted the short-lived CBS game show ''[[Double Dare (CBS game show)|Double Dare]]''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Noel |title=The Evolution of Alex Trebek |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-evolution-of-alex-trebek-1798215578 |website=tv.avclub.com |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> (not to be confused with the [[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|1986 Nickelodeon game show of the same name]]). ''Double Dare'' turned out to be his only game show with the CBS network (he returned to CBS in 1994 to host [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]] until 1998), and the first show he hosted for what was then [[Mark Goodson|Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions]], as well as the second season of the syndicated series ''[[The $128,000 Question]],'' which was recorded in [[Toronto]].\n\nSince the second incarnation of ''High Rollers'' premiered while ''The $128,000 Question'' was still airing and taping episodes, Trebek became one of two hosts to emcee shows in both the United States and Canada, joining [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]], who was hosting ''[[Definition (game show)|Definition]]'' and ''[[Headline Hunters (game show)|Headline Hunters]]'' in Canada and ''[[Card Sharks]],'' which, coincidentally, premiered the same day as ''High Rollers'' in 1978 in the United States. Trebek's [[French language|francophone]] side was put on display in 1978, in a special bilingual edition of ''Reach for the Top'' and its Radio-Canada equivalent, ''[[G\u00e9nies en herbe]].'' In this show Trebek alternated smoothly between French and English throughout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/programs/2089/ |title=CBC Archives |work=CBC News |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105314/http://archives.cbc.ca/programs/2089/ |archivedate=May 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLike other hosts of the day, Trebek made several guest appearances as a panelist or player on other shows. One of his guest appearances was on a special week of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Card Sharks]],'' in 1980. He and several other game show hosts ([[Allen Ludden]], [[Bill Cullen]], [[Wink Martindale]], [[Jack Clark (television personality)|Jack Clark]], [[Gene Rayburn]], and [[Jim Lange]]) competed in a week-long round robin tournament for charity. Trebek won the tournament, defeating Cullen in the finals. Trebek also appeared as a celebrity teammate on the NBC game show ''[[The Magnificent Marble Machine]]'' in 1975, and the [[Tom Kennedy (television host)|Tom Kennedy]]-hosted NBC word game ''[[To Say the Least]]'' in 1978. Both of those shows were produced by Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley Productions, which also produced ''High Rollers,'' the show Trebek was hosting during both of those guest appearances. Trebek also was a contestant on ''[[Celebrity Bowling]]'' in 1976, teamed with [[Jim McKrell]]. The duo won their match against [[Dick Gautier]] and [[Scatman Crothers]].\n\nAfter ''[[High Rollers]]'' was cancelled in 1980, Trebek moved on to ''[[Battlestars (game show)|Battlestars]]'' for NBC. The series debuted in October 1981, and was cancelled in April 1982 after only six months on the air.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lowe |first1=Lindsay |title=Happy Birthday, Alex Trebek! 7 TV Shows He Has Hosted Besides Jeopardy! |url=https://parade.com/585275/lindsaylowe/happy-birthday-alex-trebek-7-tv-shows-he-has-hosted-besides-jeopardy/ |website=Parade.com |publisher=AMG/Parade |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> In September 1981 Trebek took the helm of the syndicated ''[[Pitfall (game show)|Pitfall]]'', which taped in [[Vancouver]] and forced him to commute, as he had done while hosting ''High Rollers'' and ''The $128,000 Question'' in 1978. ''Pitfall'' was cancelled after its production company, Catalena Productions, went bankrupt. As a result, he was never paid for that series. After both series ended, Trebek hosted a revival of ''Battlestars'' called ''The New Battlestars'' that ended after thirteen weeks, then shot a series of pilots for other series for producers [[Merrill Heatter]], for whom he had worked hosting ''High Rollers'' and ''Battlestars'', and [[Merv Griffin]]. The Heatter pilots were ''Malcolm'', an NBC-ordered pilot featuring Trebek with an animated character as his co-host, and ''Lucky Numbers,'' an attempt at a revival of ''High Rollers'' that failed to sell. For Griffin, he shot two pilots for a revival of ''Jeopardy!'' when original host [[Art Fleming]] (a friend of Trebek's) declined to return to the role due to creative differences. This revival sold; Trebek began hosting the revival in 1984 and has hosted ever since.\n\nIn 1987, while still hosting ''Jeopardy!'', Trebek returned to daytime television as host of NBC's ''[[Concentration (game show)#Classic Concentration (1987\u20131991)|Classic Concentration]]'' his second show for [[Mark Goodson]]. He hosted both shows simultaneously until September 20, 1991, when ''Classic Concentration'' aired its final first-run episode<ref>{{cite web |title=Classic Concentration |url=http://buzzrplay.com/show/vintage/classic-concentration |website=BuzzrPlay.com |access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref> (NBC would air repeats until 1993). In 1991 Trebek made broadcast history by becoming the first person to host three American game shows at the same time, earning this distinction on February 4, 1991, when he took over for [[Lynn Swann]] as host of NBC's ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', also for Goodson-Todman, which he hosted until the end of the series' run on May 31, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=To Tell The Truth (TV Series 1990\u20131991)-Cast |url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0285408/fullcredits/cast?ref_=m_ttfc_2 |website=IMDB.com |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Trebek returned to the CBS network for the first time since hosting ''Double Dare'' to host the ''[[Pillsbury Bake-Off]]'', which he hosted until 1998.\n\nIn August 1995 in a return to his broadcast-news roots, Trebek filled in for [[Charles Gibson]] for a week on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.\n\nTrebek was a guest star in season 3 of ''[[The X-Files]]'', playing one of two \"Men in Black\" (human agents charged with the supervision of extraterrestrial lifeforms on Earth, hiding their existence from other humans) opposite [[Jesse Ventura]], in the episode ''[[Jose Chung's From Outer Space]]'', which first aired on April 12, 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=The X-Files Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751147/ |website=IMDB.com |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nTrebek and [[Pat Sajak]], host of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', traded places on April Fools' Day 1997. Pat Sajak hosted ''Jeopardy!'' and Alex Trebek hosted ''Wheel of Fortune'' with Sajak's wife, Lesly, as Trebek's co-host.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=April Fool's Day Special|series=Wheel of Fortune|date=April 1, 1997|network=Syndicated|credits=[[Columbia TriStar Television]]; [[Harry Friedman]], producer; Dick Carson, director}}</ref> Sajak and ''Wheel of Fortune'' co-host [[Vanna White]] played contestants at the wheel, with winnings going toward charities.\n\nTrebek appeared on ''[[Celebrity Poker Showdown]]'' in 2005. He came in second place in his qualifying game, losing to [[Cheryl Hines]]. On May 9, 2008, Trebek was a guest on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. On the program, he discussed his 24-year career as the host of ''Jeopardy!''. Revisiting Kimmel in 2011, he talked about the IBM Challenge on ''Jeopardy!''.\n\nTrebek also appears in many commercials for [[Colonial Penn]] Life Insurance, of which he is a \"compensated endorser\", and he reprised his role as host of ''To Tell the Truth'' in a 2010 advertisement for [[DirecTV]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wasserman |first1=Todd |title=New DirecTV Ads Dish It Out |url=https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/new-directv-ads-dish-it-out-107154/ |website=Adweek.com |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Trebek USAF.jpg|thumb|Alex Trebek at [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa, Japan]], on March 31, 2007]]\nIn December 2010, Trebek guest-starred on ''[[How I Met Your Mother]].''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tvguide.com/News/Exclusive-Alex-Trebek-1025741.aspx|title= Exclusive: Alex Trebek to Guest Star on How I Met Your Mother|publisher=TVGuide.com|access-date=November 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2014, Alex Trebek made a guest appearance on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' as himself.<ref name=\"Hot in Cleveland season 5\">[[Hot in Cleveland (season 5)]]</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2014, [[Guinness World Records]] presented Alex with the world record for most episodes of a game show hosted, with 6,829 episodes at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/6/video-jeopardy!-star-alex-trebek-sets-record-for-most-game-show-episodes-hosted|date=June 13, 2014|title='Jeopardy!' star Alex Trebek sets record for most game show episodes hosted|author=Guinness World Records|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|access-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202092017/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/6/video-jeopardy!-star-alex-trebek-sets-record-for-most-game-show-episodes-hosted|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status = dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the December 18, 2014 series-finale episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Trebek (introduced as \"the one with all the answers\") greets Colbert as he boards a sleigh driven by Santa Claus and [[Abraham Lincoln]] and leaves the studio for the last time.<ref name=\"ew14\">{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/12/19/colbert-report-finale/|date=December 19, 2014|title='The Colbert Report' wraps up with an immortal, star-studded finale|author=Hillary Busis|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2018, Trebek returned as a panelist on the ABC revival of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, Trebek moderated the only debate in the [[2018 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election|Pennsylvania governor's race]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/02/alex-trebek-moderated-a-gubernatorial-debate-in-pennsylvania-it-didnt-go-well/ |title=Alex Trebek moderated a gubernatorial debate in Pennsylvania. |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=October 2, 2018 |author=Antonia Noori Farza}}</ref> According to news outlets, he wanted to change the flow of the debate to be more conversational instead of the more traditional format.

A year later Trebek hosted the popular [[Heatter-Quigley Productions|Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley]] game show, ''[[High Rollers]],'' which had two incarnations on NBC (1974\u201376 and 1978\u201380), and an accompanying syndicated season (1975\u201376). In between stints as host of ''High Rollers,'' Trebek hosted the short-lived CBS game show ''[[Double Dare (CBS game show)|Double Dare]]''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Noel |title=The Evolution of Alex Trebek |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-evolution-of-alex-trebek-1798215578 |website=tv.avclub.com |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> (not to be confused with the [[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|1986 Nickelodeon game show of the same name]]). ''Double Dare'' turned out to be his only game show with the CBS network (he returned to CBS in 1994 to host [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]] until 1998), and the first show he hosted for what was then [[Mark Goodson|Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions]], as well as the second season of the syndicated series ''[[The $128,000 Question]],'' which was recorded in [[Toronto]].\n\nSince the second incarnation of ''High Rollers'' premiered while ''The $128,000 Question'' was still airing and taping episodes, Trebek became one of two hosts to emcee shows in both the United States and Canada, joining [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]], who was hosting ''[[Definition (game show)|Definition]]'' and ''[[Headline Hunters (game show)|Headline Hunters]]'' in Canada and ''[[Card Sharks]],'' which, coincidentally, premiered the same day as ''High Rollers'' in 1978 in the United States. Trebek's [[French language|francophone]] side was put on display in 1978, in a special bilingual edition of ''Reach for the Top'' and its Radio-Canada equivalent, ''[[G\u00e9nies en herbe]].'' In this show Trebek alternated smoothly between French and English throughout.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/programs/2089/ |title=CBC Archives |work=CBC News |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105314/http://archives.cbc.ca/programs/2089/ |archivedate=May 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLike other hosts of the day, Trebek made several guest appearances as a panelist or player on other shows. One of his guest appearances was on a special week of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Card Sharks]],'' in 1980. He and several other game show hosts ([[Allen Ludden]], [[Bill Cullen]], [[Wink Martindale]], [[Jack Clark (television personality)|Jack Clark]], [[Gene Rayburn]], and [[Jim Lange]]) competed in a week-long round robin tournament for charity. Trebek won the tournament, defeating Cullen in the finals. Trebek also appeared as a celebrity teammate on the NBC game show ''[[The Magnificent Marble Machine]]'' in 1975, and the [[Tom Kennedy (television host)|Tom Kennedy]]-hosted NBC word game ''[[To Say the Least]]'' in 1978. Both of those shows were produced by Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley Productions, which also produced ''High Rollers,'' the show Trebek was hosting during both of those guest appearances. Trebek also was a contestant on ''[[Celebrity Bowling]]'' in 1976, teamed with [[Jim McKrell]]. The duo won their match against [[Dick Gautier]] and [[Scatman Crothers]].\n\nAfter ''[[High Rollers]]'' was cancelled in 1980, Trebek moved on to ''[[Battlestars (game show)|Battlestars]]'' for NBC. The series debuted in October 1981, and was cancelled in April 1982 after only six months on the air.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lowe |first1=Lindsay |title=Happy Birthday, Alex Trebek! 7 TV Shows He Has Hosted Besides Jeopardy! |url=https://parade.com/585275/lindsaylowe/happy-birthday-alex-trebek-7-tv-shows-he-has-hosted-besides-jeopardy/ |website=Parade.com |publisher=AMG/Parade |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> In September 1981 Trebek took the helm of the syndicated ''[[Pitfall (game show)|Pitfall]]'', which taped in [[Vancouver]] and forced him to commute, as he had done while hosting ''High Rollers'' and ''The $128,000 Question'' in 1978. ''Pitfall'' was cancelled after its production company, Catalena Productions, went bankrupt. As a result, he was never paid for that series. After both series ended, Trebek hosted a revival of ''Battlestars'' called ''The New Battlestars'' that ended after thirteen weeks, then shot a series of pilots for other series for producers [[Merrill Heatter]], for whom he had worked hosting ''High Rollers'' and ''Battlestars'', and [[Merv Griffin]]. The Heatter pilots were ''Malcolm'', an NBC-ordered pilot featuring Trebek with an animated character as his co-host, and ''Lucky Numbers,'' an attempt at a revival of ''High Rollers'' that failed to sell. For Griffin, he shot two pilots for a revival of ''Jeopardy!'' when original host [[Art Fleming]] (a friend of Trebek's) declined to return to the role due to creative differences. This revival sold; Trebek began hosting the revival in 1984 and has hosted ever since.\n\nIn 1987, while still hosting ''Jeopardy!'', Trebek returned to daytime television as host of NBC's ''[[Concentration (game show)#Classic Concentration (1987\u20131991)|Classic Concentration]]'' his second show for [[Mark Goodson]].

In 1991 Trebek made broadcast history by becoming the first person to host three American game shows at the same time, earning this distinction on February 4, 1991, when he took over for [[Lynn Swann]] as host of NBC's ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', also for Goodson-Todman, which he hosted until the end of the series' run on May 31, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=To Tell The Truth (TV Series 1990\u20131991)-Cast |url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0285408/fullcredits/cast?ref_=m_ttfc_2 |website=IMDB.com |access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Trebek returned to the CBS network for the first time since hosting ''Double Dare'' to host the ''[[Pillsbury Bake-Off]]'', which he hosted until 1998.\n\nIn August 1995 in a return to his broadcast-news roots, Trebek filled in for [[Charles Gibson]] for a week on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.\n\nTrebek was a guest star in season 3 of ''[[The X-Files]]'', playing one of two \"Men in Black\" (human agents charged with the supervision of extraterrestrial lifeforms on Earth, hiding their existence from other humans) opposite [[Jesse Ventura]], in the episode ''[[Jose Chung's From Outer Space]]'', which first aired on April 12, 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=The X-Files Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0751147/ |website=IMDB.com |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nTrebek and [[Pat Sajak]], host of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', traded places on April Fools' Day 1997.

Revisiting Kimmel in 2011, he talked about the IBM Challenge on ''Jeopardy!''.\n\nTrebek also appears in many commercials for [[Colonial Penn]] Life Insurance, of which he is a \"compensated endorser\", and he reprised his role as host of ''To Tell the Truth'' in a 2010 advertisement for [[DirecTV]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wasserman |first1=Todd |title=New DirecTV Ads Dish It Out |url=https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/new-directv-ads-dish-it-out-107154/ |website=Adweek.com |accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Trebek USAF.jpg|thumb|Alex Trebek at [[Kadena Air Base]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa, Japan]], on March 31, 2007]]\nIn December 2010, Trebek guest-starred on ''[[How I Met Your Mother]].''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tvguide.com/News/Exclusive-Alex-Trebek-1025741.aspx|title= Exclusive: Alex Trebek to Guest Star on How I Met Your Mother|publisher=TVGuide.com|access-date=November 18, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2014, Alex Trebek made a guest appearance on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' as himself.<ref name=\"Hot in Cleveland season 5\">[[Hot in Cleveland (season 5)]]</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2014, [[Guinness World Records]] presented Alex with the world record for most episodes of a game show hosted, with 6,829 episodes at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/6/video-jeopardy!-star-alex-trebek-sets-record-for-most-game-show-episodes-hosted|date=June 13, 2014|title='Jeopardy!' star Alex Trebek sets record for most game show episodes hosted|author=Guinness World Records|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|access-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202092017/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/6/video-jeopardy!-star-alex-trebek-sets-record-for-most-game-show-episodes-hosted|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status = dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the December 18, 2014 series-finale episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Trebek (introduced as \"the one with all the answers\") greets Colbert as he boards a sleigh driven by Santa Claus and [[Abraham Lincoln]] and leaves the studio for the last time.<ref name=\"ew14\">{{cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/12/19/colbert-report-finale/|date=December 19, 2014|title='The Colbert Report' wraps up with an immortal, star-studded finale|author=Hillary Busis|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=December 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2018, Trebek returned as a panelist on the ABC revival of ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, Trebek moderated the only debate in the [[2018 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election|Pennsylvania governor's race]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/02/alex-trebek-moderated-a-gubernatorial-debate-in-pennsylvania-it-didnt-go-well/ |title=Alex Trebek moderated a gubernatorial debate in Pennsylvania. |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=October 2, 2018 |author=Antonia Noori Farza}}</ref> According to news outlets, he wanted to change the flow of the debate to be more conversational instead of the more traditional format.

Then, using information in its [[routing table]] or [[routing policy]], it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.\n\nThe most familiar type of IP routers are [[Home router|home and small office routers]] that simply forward [[IP packet (disambiguation)|IP packet]]s<!--intentional link to disambig, could be either IPv4 or IPv6 packet--> between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which connects to the Internet through an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful [[core router]]s that forward data at high speed along the [[optical fiber]] lines of the [[Internet backbone]].  \n\n==Operation==\nWhen multiple routers are used in interconnected networks, the routers can exchange information about destination addresses using a [[routing protocol]]. Each router builds up a [[routing table]] listing the preferred routes between any two computer systems on the interconnected networks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cisco Networking Academy's Introduction to Routing Dynamically|url=http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210&seqNum=4|publisher=Cisco|accessdate=August 1, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027133937/http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210&seqNum=4|archivedate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA router has two types of network element components organized onto separate processing ''planes'':<ref>{{cite ietf |title=Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding |rfc=3654 |author=H. Khosravi & T. Anderson |date=November 2003}}</ref>\n* [[Control plane]]: A router maintains a routing table that lists which route should be used to forward a data packet, and through which physical interface connection. It does this using internal preconfigured directives, called [[static route]]s, or by learning routes [[Dynamic routing|dynamically]] using a routing protocol. Static and dynamic routes are stored in the routing table. The control-plane logic then strips non-essential directives from the table and builds a [[forwarding information base]] (FIB) to be used by the forwarding plane.\n* [[Forwarding plane]]: The router forwards data packets between incoming and outgoing interface connections. It forwards them to the correct network type using information that the packet [[Header (computing)|header]] contains matched to entries in the FIB supplied by the control plane.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office [[DSL router]] showing the [[telephone socket]] ''(left, white)'' to connect it to the internet using [[ADSL]], and [[Ethernet]] jacks ''(right, yellow)'' to connect it to home computers and printers.]]\n\nA router may have interfaces for different types of [[physical layer]] connections, such as copper cables, [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]], or [[wireless]] transmission. It can also support different [[network layer]] transmission standards. Each network interface is used to enable data packets to be forwarded from one transmission system to another. Routers may also be used to connect two or more logical groups of computer devices known as [[Subnetwork|subnets]], each with a different [[network prefix]].\n\nRouters may provide connectivity within enterprises, between enterprises and the Internet, or between [[internet service provider]]s' (ISPs') networks. The largest routers (such as the [[Cisco CRS-1]] or [[Juniper Networks|Juniper]] PTX) interconnect the various ISPs, or may be used in large enterprise networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my-technet.com/index.php/cisco/setting-up-netflow-on-cisco-routers/|title=Setting uo Netflow on Cisco Routers|publisher=MY-Technet.com date unknown|accessdate=15 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714141500/http://my-technet.com/index.php/cisco/setting-up-netflow-on-cisco-routers/|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref> Smaller routers usually provide connectivity for typical home and office networks.\n\nAll sizes of routers may be found inside enterprises.<ref name=\"port\">{{cite web|url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/windows-home-server-router-setup.aspx|title=Windows Home Server: Router Setup|publisher=Microsoft Technet 14 Aug 2010|accessdate=15 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222175405/http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/windows-home-server-router-setup.aspx|archivedate=22 December 2010}}</ref> The most powerful routers are usually found in ISPs, academic and research facilities.

Set up in 1972 as an informal group to consider the technical issues involved in connecting different networks, it became a subcommittee of the [[International Federation for Information Processing]] later that year.<ref>Davies, Shanks, Heart, Barker, Despres, Detwiler and Riml, \"Report of Subgroup 1 on Communication System\", INWG Note No. 1.</ref> These gateway devices were different from most previous [[packet switching]] schemes in two ways.

They were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern Internet routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than routers processing AppleTalk, DECnet, IP and Xerox protocols.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s and in the 1980s, general-purpose [[minicomputer]]s served as routers. Modern high-speed routers are highly specialized computers with extra [[Computer hardware|hardware]] added to speed both common routing functions, such as packet forwarding, and specialised functions such as [[IPsec]] encryption. There is substantial use of [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] software based machines, running [[Open-source software|open source]] routing code, for research and other applications. The [[Cisco IOS]] operating system was independently designed. Major router operating systems, such as [[Junos]] and [[NX-OS]], are extensively modified versions of Unix software.\n\n== Forwarding ==\n{{Further|Routing|IP routing}}\nThe main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks. A router is considered a [[layer-3]] device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When a router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the [[Data link layer|layer-2]] data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry. A router typically does not look into the packet payload,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, [[quality of service]] (QoS). For pure IP forwarding, a router is designed to minimize the [[State (computer science)|state]] information associated with individual packets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Lawrence|title=The Next Generation of IP - Flow Routing|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=22 July 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404030549/http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet.{{efn|The forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data, if so configured.}}\n\nThe routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a [[default route|default]] or [[static route]]s that are configured manually, or [[routing protocol|dynamic routing protocols]] where the router learns routes from other routers.  A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common&nbsp;\u2013  even necessary&nbsp;\u2013  in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the [[Internet service provider]]. The default route can be manually configured (as a [[static route]]), or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by [[DHCP]].{{efn|A router can serve as a DHCP client or as a DHCP server.}}<ref>{{cite web|author=David Davis|title=Cisco administration 101: What you need to know about default routes|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes|date=April 19, 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131617133200/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes/|archivedate=December 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA router can run more than one routing protocol at a time, particularly if it serves as an autonomous system border router between parts of a network that run different routing protocols; if it does so, then redistribution may be used (usually selectively) to share information between the different protocols running on the same router.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBesides making a decision as to which interface a packet is forwarded to, which is handled primarily via the routing table, a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process. Three policies commonly used in the Internet are [[tail drop]], [[random early detection]] (RED), and [[weighted random early detection]] (WRED). Tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented; the router simply drops new incoming packets once the length of the queue exceeds the size of the buffers in the router. RED probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a pre-configured portion of the buffer, until a pre-determined max, when it becomes tail drop. WRED requires a weight on the average queue size to act upon when the traffic is about to exceed the pre-configured size, so that short bursts will not trigger random drops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother function a router performs is to decide which packet should be processed first when multiple queues exist. This is managed through [[Quality of service|QoS]], which is critical when [[Voice over IP]] is deployed, so as not to introduce excessive [[Latency (audio)|latency]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nYet another function a router performs is called [[policy-based routing]] where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013|chapter=Chapter 5: Implementing Path Control}}</ref>\n\nRouter functions may be performed through the same internal paths that the packets travel inside the router. Some of the functions may be performed through an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) to avoid overhead of scheduling CPU time to process the packets. Others may have to be performed through the CPU as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an ASIC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[DECbit]]\n* [[Mobile broadband modem]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Residential gateway]]\n* [[Switch virtual interface]]\n* [[Content-addressable memory#Ternary CAMs|TCAM]] Content addressable memory (hardware acceleration of route-search)\n* [[Wireless router]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Network routers}}\n{{Wikibooks|Communication Networks/Routing}}\n{{Wiktionary|router}}\n* [http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html#Routing%20Area Internet Engineering Task Force, the Routing Area] last checked 21 January 2011.\n{{Routing software}}\n\n[[Category:Routers (computing)| ]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:Hardware routers]]\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n[[Category:Server appliance]]\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the network device|the woodworking tool|Router (woodworking)}}\n{{short description|Device that forwards data packets between computer networks, creating an overlay internetwork}}\n\n[[File:Ciscosystemsrouteratcern.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] ASM/2-32EM router deployed at [[CERN]] in 1987]]\n\nA '''router'''{{efn|Router is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|u\u02d0|t|\u0259r}} in [[British English]] and is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|a\u028a|t|\u0259r}} in [[American English|American]] and [[Australian English]].<ref>{{OED|router}}</ref>}} is a [[networking device]] that forwards [[data packet]]s between [[computer network]]s.

The idea for a router (called \"[[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]\" at the time) initially came about through an international group of computer networking researchers called the International Network Working Group (INWG). Set up in 1972 as an informal group to consider the technical issues involved in connecting different networks, it became a subcommittee of the [[International Federation for Information Processing]] later that year.<ref>Davies, Shanks, Heart, Barker, Despres, Detwiler and Riml, \"Report of Subgroup 1 on Communication System\", INWG Note No. 1.</ref> These gateway devices were different from most previous [[packet switching]] schemes in two ways. First, they connected dissimilar kinds of networks, such as [[serial line]]s and [[local area network]]s. Second, they were [[connectionless]] devices, which had no role in assuring that traffic was delivered reliably, leaving that entirely to the [[host (network)|hosts]].{{efn|This particular idea had been previously pioneered in the [[CYCLADES]] network.}}\n\nThe idea was explored in more detail, with the intention to produce a prototype system as part of two contemporaneous programs.

They were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern Internet routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than routers processing AppleTalk, DECnet, IP and Xerox protocols.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s and in the 1980s, general-purpose [[minicomputer]]s served as routers. Modern high-speed routers are highly specialized computers with extra [[Computer hardware|hardware]] added to speed both common routing functions, such as packet forwarding, and specialised functions such as [[IPsec]] encryption. There is substantial use of [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] software based machines, running [[Open-source software|open source]] routing code, for research and other applications. The [[Cisco IOS]] operating system was independently designed. Major router operating systems, such as [[Junos]] and [[NX-OS]], are extensively modified versions of Unix software.\n\n== Forwarding ==\n{{Further|Routing|IP routing}}\nThe main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks. A router is considered a [[layer-3]] device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When a router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the [[Data link layer|layer-2]] data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry. A router typically does not look into the packet payload,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, [[quality of service]] (QoS). For pure IP forwarding, a router is designed to minimize the [[State (computer science)|state]] information associated with individual packets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Lawrence|title=The Next Generation of IP - Flow Routing|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=22 July 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404030549/http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet.{{efn|The forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data, if so configured.}}\n\nThe routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a [[default route|default]] or [[static route]]s that are configured manually, or [[routing protocol|dynamic routing protocols]] where the router learns routes from other routers.  A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common&nbsp;\u2013  even necessary&nbsp;\u2013  in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the [[Internet service provider]]. The default route can be manually configured (as a [[static route]]), or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by [[DHCP]].{{efn|A router can serve as a DHCP client or as a DHCP server.}}<ref>{{cite web|author=David Davis|title=Cisco administration 101: What you need to know about default routes|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes|date=April 19, 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131617133200/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes/|archivedate=December 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA router can run more than one routing protocol at a time, particularly if it serves as an autonomous system border router between parts of a network that run different routing protocols; if it does so, then redistribution may be used (usually selectively) to share information between the different protocols running on the same router.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBesides making a decision as to which interface a packet is forwarded to, which is handled primarily via the routing table, a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process. Three policies commonly used in the Internet are [[tail drop]], [[random early detection]] (RED), and [[weighted random early detection]] (WRED). Tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented; the router simply drops new incoming packets once the length of the queue exceeds the size of the buffers in the router. RED probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a pre-configured portion of the buffer, until a pre-determined max, when it becomes tail drop. WRED requires a weight on the average queue size to act upon when the traffic is about to exceed the pre-configured size, so that short bursts will not trigger random drops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother function a router performs is to decide which packet should be processed first when multiple queues exist. This is managed through [[Quality of service|QoS]], which is critical when [[Voice over IP]] is deployed, so as not to introduce excessive [[Latency (audio)|latency]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nYet another function a router performs is called [[policy-based routing]] where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013|chapter=Chapter 5: Implementing Path Control}}</ref>\n\nRouter functions may be performed through the same internal paths that the packets travel inside the router. Some of the functions may be performed through an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) to avoid overhead of scheduling CPU time to process the packets. Others may have to be performed through the CPU as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an ASIC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[DECbit]]\n* [[Mobile broadband modem]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Residential gateway]]\n* [[Switch virtual interface]]\n* [[Content-addressable memory#Ternary CAMs|TCAM]] Content addressable memory (hardware acceleration of route-search)\n* [[Wireless router]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Network routers}}\n{{Wikibooks|Communication Networks/Routing}}\n{{Wiktionary|router}}\n* [http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html#Routing%20Area Internet Engineering Task Force, the Routing Area] last checked 21 January 2011.\n{{Routing software}}\n\n[[Category:Routers (computing)| ]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:Hardware routers]]\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n[[Category:Server appliance]]\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistorical and technical information:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1975-1976 \u2192 1975\u20131976", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)"}

Production of \"Yauza\" was discontinued in 2002 due to ongoing reliability issues.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 81-720/721 \"Jauza\" subway cars.\n\nThe automated train control system \"Vityaz-1\" was developed by JSC \"Research Institute of Instrument them. Tikhomirov \". [1]\n\nIn 1993, at the Polezhaevskaya subway station, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]], Prime Minister [[V.S. Chernomyrdin]], and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov attended the ceremony marking the debut of the new trains, consisting of 81-720 (lead) and 81-721 (intermediate) cars numbered 001-002-003-004-005.\n\nThe new cars deviated significantly from the traditional design. The body is made of stainless steel, painted in a yellow-gray color scheme as opposed to the traditional blue color scheme used on previous models. The lead cars had a distinctive modern design at the cab end. Other improvements included the addition of ceiling fans (as opposed to air ducts used on the older series cars), cab air conditioning and heating systems, more standee room (increasing the capacity of each car by 30 - 40 people), bigger cab, and a new design of the trucks. The original design featured padded bench seats matching the contours of the human back, however this design was soon dropped and subsequent models were built with the standard anti-vandal plastic seats. The cars had DC-120 type traction motors (4 per car) and a thyristor-pulse control system developed by AEC \"Dynamo\", as well as regenerative breaking, recycling energy back into the third rail, allowing the cars to operate smoother, quieter, and more efficiently. The maximum design speed was increased to 100&nbsp;km/h vs 90&nbsp;km/h for the 81-717/714 and earlier classes of cars due.\n\nThe cars featured an automatic sprinkler system that would instantly form a water cloud inside the car in the event of a fire, however there are also fire extinguishers in each car.\n\nIn late 1992, a new experimental version of Yauza came out, equipped with Dinamo-made AC traction motors. Tests were carried out in the suburban ring VNIIZhT Sherbinka. Since there is no third rail at the test site, the train was temporarily fitted with a pantograph to collect power from overhead wires, which were set to provide 850 V of current. Unfortunately, the cars have not been completely trouble-free. Often numerous mechanical or structural difficulties were encountered.\n\nThe Yauza trains operated regularly on the Kakhovskaya until 2019 and Lublin-Dmitrov lines: 6 81-720/721 trains built between 1991 and 2002 on [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and 3 81-720.1/721.1 trains built in 2004 on [[Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line]]. No further production runs were made and the Moscow Metro chose instead to purchase more 81-717/714.5M and brand new 81-740/741 models.

Production of \"Yauza\" was discontinued in 2002 due to ongoing reliability issues.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 81-720/721 \"Jauza\" subway cars.\n\nThe automated train control system \"Vityaz-1\" was developed by JSC \"Research Institute of Instrument them. Tikhomirov \". [1]\n\nIn 1993, at the Polezhaevskaya subway station, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]], Prime Minister [[V.S. Chernomyrdin]], and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov attended the ceremony marking the debut of the new trains, consisting of 81-720 (lead) and 81-721 (intermediate) cars numbered 001-002-003-004-005.\n\nThe new cars deviated significantly from the traditional design. The body is made of stainless steel, painted in a yellow-gray color scheme as opposed to the traditional blue color scheme used on previous models. The lead cars had a distinctive modern design at the cab end. Other improvements included the addition of ceiling fans (as opposed to air ducts used on the older series cars), cab air conditioning and heating systems, more standee room (increasing the capacity of each car by 30 - 40 people), bigger cab, and a new design of the trucks. The original design featured padded bench seats matching the contours of the human back, however this design was soon dropped and subsequent models were built with the standard anti-vandal plastic seats. The cars had DC-120 type traction motors (4 per car) and a thyristor-pulse control system developed by AEC \"Dynamo\", as well as regenerative breaking, recycling energy back into the third rail, allowing the cars to operate smoother, quieter, and more efficiently. The maximum design speed was increased to 100&nbsp;km/h vs 90&nbsp;km/h for the 81-717/714 and earlier classes of cars due.\n\nThe cars featured an automatic sprinkler system that would instantly form a water cloud inside the car in the event of a fire, however there are also fire extinguishers in each car.\n\nIn late 1992, a new experimental version of Yauza came out, equipped with Dinamo-made AC traction motors. Tests were carried out in the suburban ring VNIIZhT Sherbinka. Since there is no third rail at the test site, the train was temporarily fitted with a pantograph to collect power from overhead wires, which were set to provide 850 V of current. Unfortunately, the cars have not been completely trouble-free. Often numerous mechanical or structural difficulties were encountered.\n\nThe Yauza trains operated regularly on the Kakhovskaya until 2019 and Lublin-Dmitrov lines: 6 81-720/721 trains built between 1991 and 2002 on [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and 3 81-720.1/721.1 trains built in 2004 on [[Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line]]. No further production runs were made and the Moscow Metro chose instead to purchase more 81-717/714.5M and brand new 81-740/741 models. The rest of the service on the Lublin-Dmitrov line is provided by 81-717/714.5M and 81-717/714.6K trains. It is planned to eventually transfer all 81-720/721.1 cars to the Kakhovskaya line.\n\nSeveral surplus 81-720/721 cars remained on [[Metrovagonmash|JSC \"Metrovagonmash\"]] property until 2010, before being scrapped to give space for the ongoing production of the future 81-760/761 cars, and one 81-721 car remained stored in the \"[[Krasnaya Presnya metro yard|Krasnaya Presnya]]\" depot prior to disposal in August 2013. The remaining cars would later be scrapped due to reliability issues, with the final train being withdrawn in August 2019.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n File:Metro wagon 81-720 \"Jauza\".jpg                       | Metro wagon.\n File:Yauza metro wagon interior 02.jpg | Salon view.\n</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101013123352/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=395 \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u042f\u0443\u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070521053050/http://www.metrowagonmash.ru/81-720.htm \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u042f\u0443\u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u043c\u0430\u0448]\n* [http://vagon.metro.ru/passenger/81-720.html \u0412\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044b \u042f\u0443\u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044b]\n* [http://metrotrains.narod.ru/iayza.htm \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0436\u0438 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430 81-720/721 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 Metrotrains]\n* [http://metromost.com/alb/053.htm Yauza photo on Metromost.com]\n* [https://archive.is/20130417035427/http://foto.metro.ru/%D1%8F%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B0 Yauza photo on foto.metro.ru]\n\n{{Rolling stock of Russia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:81-720 721}}\n[[Category:Multiple units of Russia]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1990-1991 \u2192 1990\u20131991", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81-720/721"}
