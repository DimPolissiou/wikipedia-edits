A pod consists of one or more containers that are guaranteed to be co-located on the host machine and can share resources.<ref name=\"do-intro\" />. The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a ''pod''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/|title=Pods|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref>\n\nEach pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique ''Pod [[IP address]]'' within the cluster, which allows applications to use ports without the risk of conflict.<ref name=\"kubernetes-101-networking\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-networking/ |title=Kubernetes 101 \u2013 Networking |last=Langemak |first=Jon |work=Das Blinken Lichten |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025035709/http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-networking/ |archivedate=2015-10-25 }}</ref> Within the pod, all containers can reference each other on localhost, but a container within one pod has no way of directly addressing another container within another pod; for that, it has to use the Pod IP Address. An application developer should never use the Pod IP Address though, to reference / invoke a capability in another pod, as Pod IP addresses are ephemeral - the specific pod that they are referencing may be assigned to another Pod IP address on restart. Instead, they should use a reference to a [[Kubernetes#Services|Service]], which holds a reference to the target pod at the specific Pod IP Address.\n\nA pod can define a volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, and expose it to the containers in the pod.<ref name=\"kubernetes-for-developers\">{{cite web |last=Strachan |first=James |url=https://medium.com/fabric8-io/kubernetes-for-developers-2a9c7202fcd3#.b6u76jxar |title=Kubernetes for Developers |work=[[Medium (publishing platform)]] |date=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907030556/https://medium.com/fabric8-io/kubernetes-for-developers-2a9c7202fcd3#.b6u76jxar |archivedate=2015-09-07 }}</ref> Pods can be managed manually through the Kubernetes [[API]], or their management can be delegated to a controller.<ref name=\"do-intro\" />  Such volumes are also the basis for the Kubernetes features of ConfigMaps (to provide access to configuration through the filesystem visible to the container) and Secrets (to provide access to credentials needed to access remote resources securely, by providing those credentials on the filesystem visible only to authorized containers).\n\n=== Replica Sets ===\nA ReplicaSet\u2019s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/|title=ReplicaSet|website=kubernetes.io|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\nThey (Replica Sets)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/course/kubernetes-101/6|title=Deployments, ReplicaSets, and pods}}</ref> can also be said to be a grouping mechanism that lets Kubernetes maintain the number of instances that have been declared for a given pod. The definition of a Replica Set uses a selector, whose evaluation will result in identifying all pods that are associated with it.\n\n=== Services ===\n[[File:Pod-networking.png|700px|thumb|Simplified view showing how Services interact with Pod networking in a Kubernetes cluster]]\nA Kubernetes service is a set of pods that work together, such as one tier of a [[Multitier architecture|multi-tier]] application. The set of pods that constitute a service are defined by a label selector.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /> Kubernetes provides two modes of [[service discovery]], using environmental variables or using Kubernetes DNS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/|title=Service|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> Service discovery assigns a stable IP address and [[DNS name]] to the service, and load balances traffic in a [[Round-robin DNS|round-robin]]  manner to network connections of that IP address among the pods matching the selector (even as failures cause the pods to move from machine to machine).<ref name=\"kubernetes-101-networking\" /> By default a service is exposed inside a cluster (e.g., [[Front and back ends|back end]] pods might be grouped into a service, with requests from the front-end pods load-balanced among them), but a service can also be exposed outside a cluster (e.g., for clients to reach front-end pods).<ref name=\"kubernetes-101-external-access\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-external-access-into-the-cluster/ |title=Kubernetes 101 \u2013 External Access Into The Cluster |last=Langemak |first=Jon |work=Das Blinken Lichten |date=2015-02-15 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026035212/http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-external-access-into-the-cluster/ |archivedate=2015-10-26 }}</ref>\n\n=== Volumes ===\nFilesystems in the Kubernetes container provide ephemeral storage, by default. This means that a restart of the pod will wipe out any data on such containers, and therefore, this form of storage is quite limiting in anything but trivial applications. A Kubernetes Volume<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/|title=Volumes|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> provides persistent storage that exists for the lifetime of the pod itself. This storage can also be used as shared disk space for containers within the pod. Volumes are mounted at specific mount points within the container, which are defined by the pod configuration, and cannot mount onto other volumes or link to other volumes. The same volume can be mounted at different points in the filesystem tree by different containers.\n\n=== Namespaces ===\nKubernetes provides a partitioning of the resources it manages into non-overlapping sets called namespaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/|title=Namespaces|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> They are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects, or even separating environments like development, test, and production.\n\n=== ConfigMaps and Secrets ===\nA common application challenge is deciding where to store and manage configuration information, some of which may contain sensitive data. Configuration data can be anything as fine-grained as individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire configuration files or JSON / XML documents. Kubernetes provides two closely related mechanisms to deal with this need:  \"configmaps\" and \"secrets\", both of which allow for configuration changes to be made without requiring an application build. The data from configmaps and secrets will be made available to every single instance of the application to which these objects have been bound via the deployment. A secret and / or a configmap is only sent to a node if a pod on that node requires it. Kubernetes will keep it in memory on that node. Once the pod that depends on the secret or configmap is deleted, the in-memory copy of all bound secrets and configmaps are deleted as well. The data is accessible to the pod through one of two ways: a) as environment variables (which will be created by Kubernetes when the pod is started) or b) available on the container filesystem that is visible only from within the pod.\n\nThe data itself is stored on the master which is a highly secured machine which nobody should have login access to. The biggest difference between a secret and a configmap is that the content of the data in a secret is base64 encoded. (On newer k8s versions, secrets are stored encrypted in etcd)\n\n=== StatefulSets ===\nIt is very easy to address the scaling of stateless applications: one simply adds more running pods\u2014which is something that Kubernetes does very well. Stateful workloads are much harder, because the state needs to be preserved if a pod is restarted, and if the application is scaled up or down, then the state may need to be redistributed. Databases are an example of stateful workloads. When run in high-availability mode, many databases come with the notion of a primary instance and a secondary instance(s). In this case, the notion of ordering of instances is important. Other applications like Kafka distribute the data amongst their brokers\u2014so one broker is not the same as another. In this case, the notion of instance uniqueness is important. StatefulSets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/|title=StatefulSets|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> are controllers (see [[#Kubernetes control plane|Controller Manager]], below) that are provided by Kubernetes that enforce the properties of uniqueness and ordering amongst instances of a pod and can be used to run stateful applications.\n\n=== DaemonSets ===\nNormally, the location where pods are run are determined by the algorithm implemented in the Kubernetes Scheduler. For some use cases, though, there could be a need to run a pod on every single node in the cluster. This is useful for use cases like log collection, and storage services. The ability to do this kind of pod scheduling is implemented by the feature called DaemonSets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/|title=DaemonSet|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref>\n\n== Managing Kubernetes objects ==\nKubernetes provides some mechanisms that allow one to manage, select, or manipulate its objects.\n\n=== Labels and selectors ===\nKubernetes enables clients (users or internal components) to attach keys called \"labels\" to any API object in the system, such as pods and [[#Kubernetes node|nodes]]. Correspondingly, \"label selectors\" are queries against labels that resolve to matching objects.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /> When a service is defined, one can define the label selectors that will be used by the service router / load balancer to select the pod instances that the traffic will be routed to. Thus, simply changing the labels of the pods or changing the label selectors on the service can be used to control which pods get traffic and which don't, which can be used to support various deployment patterns like [[blue-green deployment]]s or [[A-B testing]]. This capability to dynamically control how services utilize implementing resources provides a loose coupling within the infrastructure.\n\nFor example, if an application's pods have labels for a system <code>tier</code> (with values such as <code>front-end</code>, <code>back-end</code>, for example) and a <code>release_track</code> (with values such as <code>[[Feature toggle#Canary release|canary]]</code>, <code>production</code>, for example), then an operation on all of <code>back-end</code> and <code>canary</code> nodes can use a label selector, such as:<ref name=\"redhat-docker-and-kubernetes-training-labels-examples\">{{cite web |url=http://christianposta.com/slides/docker/generated/day2.html#/label-examples |title=Intro: Docker and Kubernetes training - Day 2 |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029210659/http://christianposta.com/slides/docker/generated/day2.html#/label-examples |archivedate=2015-10-29 }}</ref>\n<blockquote><code>tier=back-end AND release_track=canary</code></blockquote>\n\n=== Field selectors ===\nJust like labels, field selectors also let one select Kubernetes resources. Unlike labels, the selection is based on the attribute values inherent to the resource being selected, rather than user-defined categorization. <code>metadata.name</code> and <code>metadata.namespace</code> are field selectors that will be present on all Kubernetes objects. Other selectors that can be used depend on the object/resource type.\n\n=== Replication Controllers and Deployments ===\nA [[#Replica Sets|Replica Set]] declares the number of instances of a pod that is needed, and a Replication Controller manages the system so that the number of healthy pods that are running matches the number of pods declared in the Replica Set (determined by evaluating its selector).\n\nDeployments are a higher level management mechanism for replica sets. While the Replication Controller manages the scale of the Replica Set, Deployments will manage what happens to the Replica Set - whether an update has to be rolled out, or rolled back, etc. When deployments are scaled up or down, this results in the declaration of the Replica Set changing - and this change in declared state is managed by the Replication Controller.\n\n=== Cluster API ===\nThe design principles underlying Kubernetes allow one to programmatically create, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters. This function is exposed via an API called the Cluster API. A key concept embodied in the API is the notion that the Kubernetes cluster is itself a resource / object that can be managed just like any other Kubernetes resources. Similarly, machines that make up the cluster are also treated as a Kubernetes resource. The API has two pieces - the core API, and a provider implementation. The provider implementation consists of cloud-provider specific functions that let Kubernetes provide the cluster API in a fashion that is well-integrated with the cloud-provider's services and resources.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:kubernetes.png|660px|thumb|Kubernetes architecture diagram]]\n\nKubernetes follows the [[Master/slave (technology)|primary/replica architecture]]. The components of Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual [[Node (networking)|node]] and those that are part of the control plane.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Kubernetes Infrastructure|url=https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html|website=OpenShift Community Documentation|publisher=OpenShift|accessdate=24 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706121423/https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html|archivedate=6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Kubernetes control plane ===\nThe Kubernetes master is the main controlling unit of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system. The Kubernetes control plane consists of various components, each its own process, that can run both on a single master node or on multiple masters supporting [[high-availability cluster]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> The various components of Kubernetes control plane are as follows:\n* etcd: [[etcd]]<ref>[[Container Linux by CoreOS#Cluster infrastructure|Container Linux by CoreOS: Cluster infrastructure]]</ref> is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store developed by [[CoreOS]] that reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time. Just like [[Apache ZooKeeper]], etcd is a system that favors consistency over availability in the event of a network partition (see [[CAP theorem]]). This consistency is crucial for correctly scheduling and operating services. The Kubernetes API Server uses etcd's watch API to monitor the cluster and roll out critical configuration changes or simply restore any divergences of the state of the cluster back to what was declared by the deployer. As an example, if the deployer specified that three instances of a particular pod need to be running, this fact is stored in etcd. If it is found that only two instances are running, this delta will be detected by comparison with etcd data, and Kubernetes will use this to schedule the creation of an additional instance of that pod.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* API server: The API server is a key component and serves the Kubernetes [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[JSON]] over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/09/06/kubernetes-from-the-ground-up-the-api-server/|title=Kubernetes from the ground up: API server|last=Marhubi|first=Kamal|date=2015-09-26|publisher=kamalmarhubi.com|access-date=2015-11-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029131948/http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/09/06/kubernetes-from-the-ground-up-the-api-server/|archivedate=2015-10-29}}</ref> The API server processes and validates [[Representational state transfer|REST]] requests and updates state of the [[Application programming interface|API]] objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across Worker nodes.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-kubernetes |title= An Introduction to Kubernetes |access-date = 20 July 2018 |last= Ellingwood |first= Justin |date= 2 May 2018 |website= [[DigitalOcean]] |language = en |quote= One of the most important primary services is an API server.

The scheduler tracks resource use on each node to ensure that workload is not scheduled in excess of available resources. For this purpose, the scheduler must know the resource requirements, resource availability, and other user-provided constraints and policy directives such as quality-of-service, affinity/anti-affinity requirements, data locality, and so on.  In essence, the scheduler's role is to match resource \"supply\" to workload \"demand\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rancher.com/three-pillars-kubernetes-container-orchestration/|title=The Three Pillars of Kubernetes Container Orchestration - Rancher Labs|date=18 May 2017|website=rancher.com|accessdate=22 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624022635/http://rancher.com/three-pillars-kubernetes-container-orchestration/|archivedate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n* Controller manager: A controller is a reconciliation loop that drives actual cluster state toward the desired cluster state, communicating with the API server to create, update, and delete the resources it manages (pods, service endpoints, etc.). <ref name=\"coreos-replication-controller\">{{cite web |url=https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/replication-controller.html |title=Overview of a Replication Controller |work=Documentation |publisher=[[CoreOS]] |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922010433/https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/replication-controller.html |archivedate=2015-09-22 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> The controller manager is a process that manages a set of core Kubernetes controllers. One kind of controller is a Replication Controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails.<ref name=\"coreos-replication-controller\" /> Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a DaemonSet Controller for running exactly one pod on every machine (or some subset of machines), and a Job Controller for running pods that run to completion, e.g. as part of a batch job.<ref name=\"exciting-experimental-features\">{{cite web |url=http://www.livewyer.com/blog/2015/10/02/kubernetes-exciting-experimental-features |title=Kubernetes: Exciting Experimental Features |last=Sanders |first=Jake |work=Livewyer |date=2015-10-02 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020071601/http://www.livewyer.com/blog/2015/10/02/kubernetes-exciting-experimental-features |archivedate=2015-10-20 }}</ref> The set of pods that a controller manages is determined by label selectors that are part of the controller's definition.<ref name=\"redhat-docker-and-kubernetes-training-labels-examples\"/>\n\n=== Kubernetes node ===\nA Node, also known as a Worker or a Minion, is a machine where containers (workloads) are deployed. Every node in the cluster must run a container [[Runtime system|runtime]] such as [[Docker (software)|Docker]], as well as the below-mentioned components, for communication with the primary for network configuration of these containers.\n* Kubelet: Kubelet is responsible for the running state of each node, ensuring that all containers on the node are healthy. It takes care of starting, stopping, and maintaining application containers organized into pods as directed by the control plane.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/08/27/what-even-is-a-kubelet/|title=What [..] is a Kubelet?|last=Marhubi|first=Kamal|date=2015-08-27|publisher=kamalmarhubi.com|access-date=2015-11-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113064016/http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/08/27/what-even-is-a-kubelet/|archivedate=2015-11-13}}</ref>\n\n:Kubelet monitors the state of a pod, and if not in the desired state, the pod re-deploys to the same node. Node status is relayed every few seconds via heartbeat messages to the primary. Once the primary detects a node failure, the Replication Controller observes this state change and launches pods on other healthy nodes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n* Kube-proxy: The Kube-proxy is an implementation of a [[Proxy server|network proxy]] and a [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancer]], and it supports the service abstraction along with other networking operation.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /> It is responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate container based on IP and port number of the incoming request.\n* Container runtime: A container resides inside a pod. The container is the lowest level of a micro-service, which holds the running application, libraries, and their dependencies. Containers can be exposed to the world through an external IP address. Kubernetes supports Docker containers since its first version, and in July 2016 [[rkt (software)|rkt]] container engine was added.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/07/rktnetes-brings-rkt-container-engine-to-kubernetes/|title=rktnetes brings rkt container engine to Kubernetes|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref>\n\n=== Add-ons ===\nAdd-ons operate just like any other application running within the cluster: they are implemented via pods and services, and are only different in that they implement features of the Kubernetes cluster. The pods may be managed by Deployments, ReplicationControllers, and so on. There are many add-ons, and the list is growing. Some of the more important are:\n* DNS: All Kubernetes clusters should have cluster DNS; it is a mandatory feature. Cluster DNS is a DNS server, in addition to the other DNS server(s) in your environment, which serves DNS records for Kubernetes services. Containers started by Kubernetes automatically include this DNS server in their DNS searches.\n* Web UI: This is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster, as well as the cluster itself.\n* Container Resource Monitoring: Providing a reliable application runtime, and being able to scale it up or down in response to workloads, means being able to continuously and effectively monitor workload performance. Container Resource Monitoring provides this capability by recording metrics about containers in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data. The cAdvisor is a component on a slave node that provides a limited metric monitoring capability. There are full metrics pipelines as well, such as Prometheus, which can meet most monitoring needs.\n* Cluster-level logging: Logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes, pods, or containers. Otherwise, node or pod failures can cause loss of event data. The ability to do this is called cluster-level logging, and such mechanisms are responsible for saving container logs to a central log store with search/browsing interface. Kubernetes provides no native storage for log data, but one can integrate many existing logging solutions into the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n== Microservices ==\nKubernetes is commonly used as a way to host a microservice-based implementation, because it and its associated ecosystem of tools provide all the capabilities needed to address key concerns of any [[Microservices#A comparison of platforms|microservice architecture]].\n\n== Kubernetes Persistent Storage ==\nContainers emerged as a way to make software portable. The container contains all the packages you need to run a service. The provided filesystem makes containers extremely portable and easy to use in development. A container can be moved from development to test or production with no or relatively few configuration changes.\n\nHistorically Kubernetes was suitable only for stateless services. However, many applications have a database, which requires persistence, which leads to the creation of persistent storage for Kubernetes. Implementing persistent storage for containers is one of the top challenges of Kubernetes administrators, DevOps and cloud engineers. Containers may be ephemeral, but more and more of their data is not, so one needs to ensure the data's survival in case of container termination or hardware failure.\n\nWhen deploying containers with Kubernetes or containerized applications, companies often realize that they need persistent storage. They need to provide fast and reliable storage for databases, root images and other data used by the containers. Currently persistent storage for Kubernetes/storage for Kubernetes is offered by several storage providers - Portworx, Linstor ,StorPool Storage, StorageOS, NetApp and VMware.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[OpenShift]]\n* [[List of cluster management software]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://kubernetes.io/}}\n* {{GitHub|https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes|Source code}}\n{{Virtualization software}}\n{{Linux containers}}\n\n[[Category:2014 software]]\n[[Category:Cloud infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Containerization software]]\n[[Category:Free software for cloud computing]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Go]]\n[[Category:Linux Containerization]]\n[[Category:Linux Foundation projects]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apache license]]\n[[Category:Virtualization-related software for Linux]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|software to manage containers on a server-cluster}}\n{{Infobox software\n| title                  = Kubernetes\n| name                   = Kubernetes\n| logo                   = Kubernetes logo without workmark.svg\n| caption                =\n| author                 = [[Google]]\n| developer              = [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|2014|06|07|df=yes}}<ref name=\"github first-commit\">{{cite web |url=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/2c4b3a562ce34cddc3f8218a2c4d11c7310e6d56 |title=First GitHub commit for Kubernetes |work=github.com |date=2014-06-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301190551/https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/2c4b3a562ce34cddc3f8218a2c4d11c7310e6d56 |archivedate=2017-03-01 }}</ref>\n| latest release version = 1.18<ref name=\"github releases\">{{cite web |url=https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases |title=GitHub Releases page |work=github.com |url-status=live |accessdate=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n| latest release date    = {{release date and age|2020|03|25}}<ref>{{Cite web |author=Kubernetes 1.18 Release Team |url=https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/03/25/kubernetes-1-18-release-announcement/ |title=Kubernetes 1.18: Fit & Finish |accessdate=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n| programming language   = [[Go (programming language)|Go]]\n| genre                  = [[Computer cluster#Cluster management|Cluster management software]]\n| license                = [[Apache License 2.0]]\n| website                = {{URL|https://kubernetes.io/}}\n}}\n\n'''Kubernetes''' (commonly stylized as '''k8s'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@rothgar/why-kubernetes-is-abbreviated-k8s-905289405a3c|title=Why Kubernetes is Abbreviated k8s|first=Justin|last=Garrison|date=December 19, 2016|website=Medium}}</ref>) is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Operating-system-level virtualization|container]]-[[orchestration (computing)|orchestration]] system for automating [[application software|application]] deployment, scaling, and management.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/|title=kubernetes/kubernetes|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-03-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421035413/https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes|archivedate=2017-04-21}}</ref> It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation]].

The key objects are:\n\n=== Pods ===\nA ''pod'' is a higher level of abstraction grouping containerized components. A pod consists of one or more containers that are guaranteed to be co-located on the host machine and can share resources.<ref name=\"do-intro\" />. The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is a ''pod''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/|title=Pods|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref>\n\nEach pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique ''Pod [[IP address]]'' within the cluster, which allows applications to use ports without the risk of conflict.<ref name=\"kubernetes-101-networking\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-networking/ |title=Kubernetes 101 \u2013 Networking |last=Langemak |first=Jon |work=Das Blinken Lichten |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025035709/http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-networking/ |archivedate=2015-10-25 }}</ref> Within the pod, all containers can reference each other on localhost, but a container within one pod has no way of directly addressing another container within another pod; for that, it has to use the Pod IP Address. An application developer should never use the Pod IP Address though, to reference / invoke a capability in another pod, as Pod IP addresses are ephemeral - the specific pod that they are referencing may be assigned to another Pod IP address on restart. Instead, they should use a reference to a [[Kubernetes#Services|Service]], which holds a reference to the target pod at the specific Pod IP Address.\n\nA pod can define a volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, and expose it to the containers in the pod.<ref name=\"kubernetes-for-developers\">{{cite web |last=Strachan |first=James |url=https://medium.com/fabric8-io/kubernetes-for-developers-2a9c7202fcd3#.b6u76jxar |title=Kubernetes for Developers |work=[[Medium (publishing platform)]] |date=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907030556/https://medium.com/fabric8-io/kubernetes-for-developers-2a9c7202fcd3#.b6u76jxar |archivedate=2015-09-07 }}</ref> Pods can be managed manually through the Kubernetes [[API]], or their management can be delegated to a controller.<ref name=\"do-intro\" />  Such volumes are also the basis for the Kubernetes features of ConfigMaps (to provide access to configuration through the filesystem visible to the container) and Secrets (to provide access to credentials needed to access remote resources securely, by providing those credentials on the filesystem visible only to authorized containers).\n\n=== Replica Sets ===\nA ReplicaSet\u2019s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/|title=ReplicaSet|website=kubernetes.io|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\nThey (Replica Sets)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/course/kubernetes-101/6|title=Deployments, ReplicaSets, and pods}}</ref> can also be said to be a grouping mechanism that lets Kubernetes maintain the number of instances that have been declared for a given pod. The definition of a Replica Set uses a selector, whose evaluation will result in identifying all pods that are associated with it.\n\n=== Services ===\n[[File:Pod-networking.png|700px|thumb|Simplified view showing how Services interact with Pod networking in a Kubernetes cluster]]\nA Kubernetes service is a set of pods that work together, such as one tier of a [[Multitier architecture|multi-tier]] application. The set of pods that constitute a service are defined by a label selector.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /> Kubernetes provides two modes of [[service discovery]], using environmental variables or using Kubernetes DNS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/|title=Service|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> Service discovery assigns a stable IP address and [[DNS name]] to the service, and load balances traffic in a [[Round-robin DNS|round-robin]]  manner to network connections of that IP address among the pods matching the selector (even as failures cause the pods to move from machine to machine).<ref name=\"kubernetes-101-networking\" /> By default a service is exposed inside a cluster (e.g., [[Front and back ends|back end]] pods might be grouped into a service, with requests from the front-end pods load-balanced among them), but a service can also be exposed outside a cluster (e.g., for clients to reach front-end pods).<ref name=\"kubernetes-101-external-access\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-external-access-into-the-cluster/ |title=Kubernetes 101 \u2013 External Access Into The Cluster |last=Langemak |first=Jon |work=Das Blinken Lichten |date=2015-02-15 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026035212/http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/kubernetes-101-external-access-into-the-cluster/ |archivedate=2015-10-26 }}</ref>\n\n=== Volumes ===\nFilesystems in the Kubernetes container provide ephemeral storage, by default. This means that a restart of the pod will wipe out any data on such containers, and therefore, this form of storage is quite limiting in anything but trivial applications. A Kubernetes Volume<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/|title=Volumes|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> provides persistent storage that exists for the lifetime of the pod itself. This storage can also be used as shared disk space for containers within the pod. Volumes are mounted at specific mount points within the container, which are defined by the pod configuration, and cannot mount onto other volumes or link to other volumes. The same volume can be mounted at different points in the filesystem tree by different containers.\n\n=== Namespaces ===\nKubernetes provides a partitioning of the resources it manages into non-overlapping sets called namespaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/|title=Namespaces|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> They are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects, or even separating environments like development, test, and production.\n\n=== ConfigMaps and Secrets ===\nA common application challenge is deciding where to store and manage configuration information, some of which may contain sensitive data. Configuration data can be anything as fine-grained as individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire configuration files or JSON / XML documents. Kubernetes provides two closely related mechanisms to deal with this need:  \"configmaps\" and \"secrets\", both of which allow for configuration changes to be made without requiring an application build. The data from configmaps and secrets will be made available to every single instance of the application to which these objects have been bound via the deployment. A secret and / or a configmap is only sent to a node if a pod on that node requires it. Kubernetes will keep it in memory on that node. Once the pod that depends on the secret or configmap is deleted, the in-memory copy of all bound secrets and configmaps are deleted as well. The data is accessible to the pod through one of two ways: a) as environment variables (which will be created by Kubernetes when the pod is started) or b) available on the container filesystem that is visible only from within the pod.\n\nThe data itself is stored on the master which is a highly secured machine which nobody should have login access to. The biggest difference between a secret and a configmap is that the content of the data in a secret is base64 encoded. (On newer k8s versions, secrets are stored encrypted in etcd)\n\n=== StatefulSets ===\nIt is very easy to address the scaling of stateless applications: one simply adds more running pods\u2014which is something that Kubernetes does very well. Stateful workloads are much harder, because the state needs to be preserved if a pod is restarted, and if the application is scaled up or down, then the state may need to be redistributed. Databases are an example of stateful workloads. When run in high-availability mode, many databases come with the notion of a primary instance and a secondary instance(s). In this case, the notion of ordering of instances is important. Other applications like Kafka distribute the data amongst their brokers\u2014so one broker is not the same as another. In this case, the notion of instance uniqueness is important. StatefulSets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/|title=StatefulSets|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref> are controllers (see [[#Kubernetes control plane|Controller Manager]], below) that are provided by Kubernetes that enforce the properties of uniqueness and ordering amongst instances of a pod and can be used to run stateful applications.\n\n=== DaemonSets ===\nNormally, the location where pods are run are determined by the algorithm implemented in the Kubernetes Scheduler. For some use cases, though, there could be a need to run a pod on every single node in the cluster. This is useful for use cases like log collection, and storage services. The ability to do this kind of pod scheduling is implemented by the feature called DaemonSets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/|title=DaemonSet|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref>\n\n== Managing Kubernetes objects ==\nKubernetes provides some mechanisms that allow one to manage, select, or manipulate its objects.\n\n=== Labels and selectors ===\nKubernetes enables clients (users or internal components) to attach keys called \"labels\" to any API object in the system, such as pods and [[#Kubernetes node|nodes]]. Correspondingly, \"label selectors\" are queries against labels that resolve to matching objects.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /> When a service is defined, one can define the label selectors that will be used by the service router / load balancer to select the pod instances that the traffic will be routed to. Thus, simply changing the labels of the pods or changing the label selectors on the service can be used to control which pods get traffic and which don't, which can be used to support various deployment patterns like [[blue-green deployment]]s or [[A-B testing]]. This capability to dynamically control how services utilize implementing resources provides a loose coupling within the infrastructure.\n\nFor example, if an application's pods have labels for a system <code>tier</code> (with values such as <code>front-end</code>, <code>back-end</code>, for example) and a <code>release_track</code> (with values such as <code>[[Feature toggle#Canary release|canary]]</code>, <code>production</code>, for example), then an operation on all of <code>back-end</code> and <code>canary</code> nodes can use a label selector, such as:<ref name=\"redhat-docker-and-kubernetes-training-labels-examples\">{{cite web |url=http://christianposta.com/slides/docker/generated/day2.html#/label-examples |title=Intro: Docker and Kubernetes training - Day 2 |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029210659/http://christianposta.com/slides/docker/generated/day2.html#/label-examples |archivedate=2015-10-29 }}</ref>\n<blockquote><code>tier=back-end AND release_track=canary</code></blockquote>\n\n=== Field selectors ===\nJust like labels, field selectors also let one select Kubernetes resources. Unlike labels, the selection is based on the attribute values inherent to the resource being selected, rather than user-defined categorization. <code>metadata.name</code> and <code>metadata.namespace</code> are field selectors that will be present on all Kubernetes objects. Other selectors that can be used depend on the object/resource type.\n\n=== Replication Controllers and Deployments ===\nA [[#Replica Sets|Replica Set]] declares the number of instances of a pod that is needed, and a Replication Controller manages the system so that the number of healthy pods that are running matches the number of pods declared in the Replica Set (determined by evaluating its selector).\n\nDeployments are a higher level management mechanism for replica sets. While the Replication Controller manages the scale of the Replica Set, Deployments will manage what happens to the Replica Set - whether an update has to be rolled out, or rolled back, etc. When deployments are scaled up or down, this results in the declaration of the Replica Set changing - and this change in declared state is managed by the Replication Controller.\n\n=== Cluster API ===\nThe design principles underlying Kubernetes allow one to programmatically create, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters. This function is exposed via an API called the Cluster API. A key concept embodied in the API is the notion that the Kubernetes cluster is itself a resource / object that can be managed just like any other Kubernetes resources. Similarly, machines that make up the cluster are also treated as a Kubernetes resource. The API has two pieces - the core API, and a provider implementation. The provider implementation consists of cloud-provider specific functions that let Kubernetes provide the cluster API in a fashion that is well-integrated with the cloud-provider's services and resources.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:kubernetes.png|660px|thumb|Kubernetes architecture diagram]]\n\nKubernetes follows the [[Master/slave (technology)|primary/replica architecture]]. The components of Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual [[Node (networking)|node]] and those that are part of the control plane.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Kubernetes Infrastructure|url=https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html|website=OpenShift Community Documentation|publisher=OpenShift|accessdate=24 September 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706121423/https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html|archivedate=6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Kubernetes control plane ===\nThe Kubernetes master is the main controlling unit of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system. The Kubernetes control plane consists of various components, each its own process, that can run both on a single master node or on multiple masters supporting [[high-availability cluster]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> The various components of Kubernetes control plane are as follows:\n* etcd: [[etcd]]<ref>[[Container Linux by CoreOS#Cluster infrastructure|Container Linux by CoreOS: Cluster infrastructure]]</ref> is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store developed by [[CoreOS]] that reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time. Just like [[Apache ZooKeeper]], etcd is a system that favors consistency over availability in the event of a network partition (see [[CAP theorem]]). This consistency is crucial for correctly scheduling and operating services. The Kubernetes API Server uses etcd's watch API to monitor the cluster and roll out critical configuration changes or simply restore any divergences of the state of the cluster back to what was declared by the deployer. As an example, if the deployer specified that three instances of a particular pod need to be running, this fact is stored in etcd. If it is found that only two instances are running, this delta will be detected by comparison with etcd data, and Kubernetes will use this to schedule the creation of an additional instance of that pod.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* API server: The API server is a key component and serves the Kubernetes [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[JSON]] over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], which provides both the internal and external interface to Kubernetes.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/09/06/kubernetes-from-the-ground-up-the-api-server/|title=Kubernetes from the ground up: API server|last=Marhubi|first=Kamal|date=2015-09-26|publisher=kamalmarhubi.com|access-date=2015-11-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029131948/http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/09/06/kubernetes-from-the-ground-up-the-api-server/|archivedate=2015-10-29}}</ref> The API server processes and validates [[Representational state transfer|REST]] requests and updates state of the [[Application programming interface|API]] objects in etcd, thereby allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across Worker nodes.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-kubernetes |title= An Introduction to Kubernetes |access-date = 20 July 2018 |last= Ellingwood |first= Justin |date= 2 May 2018 |website= [[DigitalOcean]] |language = en |quote= One of the most important primary services is an API server.

The scheduler tracks resource use on each node to ensure that workload is not scheduled in excess of available resources. For this purpose, the scheduler must know the resource requirements, resource availability, and other user-provided constraints and policy directives such as quality-of-service, affinity/anti-affinity requirements, data locality, and so on.  In essence, the scheduler's role is to match resource \"supply\" to workload \"demand\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rancher.com/three-pillars-kubernetes-container-orchestration/|title=The Three Pillars of Kubernetes Container Orchestration - Rancher Labs|date=18 May 2017|website=rancher.com|accessdate=22 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624022635/http://rancher.com/three-pillars-kubernetes-container-orchestration/|archivedate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n* Controller manager: A controller is a reconciliation loop that drives actual cluster state toward the desired cluster state, communicating with the API server to create, update, and delete the resources it manages (pods, service endpoints, etc.). <ref name=\"coreos-replication-controller\">{{cite web |url=https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/replication-controller.html |title=Overview of a Replication Controller |work=Documentation |publisher=[[CoreOS]] |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922010433/https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/replication-controller.html |archivedate=2015-09-22 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> The controller manager is a process that manages a set of core Kubernetes controllers. One kind of controller is a Replication Controller, which handles replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a pod across the cluster. It also handles creating replacement pods if the underlying node fails.<ref name=\"coreos-replication-controller\" /> Other controllers that are part of the core Kubernetes system include a DaemonSet Controller for running exactly one pod on every machine (or some subset of machines), and a Job Controller for running pods that run to completion, e.g. as part of a batch job.<ref name=\"exciting-experimental-features\">{{cite web |url=http://www.livewyer.com/blog/2015/10/02/kubernetes-exciting-experimental-features |title=Kubernetes: Exciting Experimental Features |last=Sanders |first=Jake |work=Livewyer |date=2015-10-02 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020071601/http://www.livewyer.com/blog/2015/10/02/kubernetes-exciting-experimental-features |archivedate=2015-10-20 }}</ref> The set of pods that a controller manages is determined by label selectors that are part of the controller's definition.<ref name=\"redhat-docker-and-kubernetes-training-labels-examples\"/>\n\n=== Kubernetes node ===\nA Node, also known as a Worker or a Minion, is a machine where containers (workloads) are deployed. Every node in the cluster must run a container [[Runtime system|runtime]] such as [[Docker (software)|Docker]], as well as the below-mentioned components, for communication with the primary for network configuration of these containers.\n* Kubelet: Kubelet is responsible for the running state of each node, ensuring that all containers on the node are healthy. It takes care of starting, stopping, and maintaining application containers organized into pods as directed by the control plane.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/08/27/what-even-is-a-kubelet/|title=What [..] is a Kubelet?|last=Marhubi|first=Kamal|date=2015-08-27|publisher=kamalmarhubi.com|access-date=2015-11-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113064016/http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2015/08/27/what-even-is-a-kubelet/|archivedate=2015-11-13}}</ref>\n\n:Kubelet monitors the state of a pod, and if not in the desired state, the pod re-deploys to the same node. Node status is relayed every few seconds via heartbeat messages to the primary. Once the primary detects a node failure, the Replication Controller observes this state change and launches pods on other healthy nodes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n* Kube-proxy: The Kube-proxy is an implementation of a [[Proxy server|network proxy]] and a [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancer]], and it supports the service abstraction along with other networking operation.<ref name=\"do-intro\" /> It is responsible for routing traffic to the appropriate container based on IP and port number of the incoming request.\n* Container runtime: A container resides inside a pod. The container is the lowest level of a micro-service, which holds the running application, libraries, and their dependencies. Containers can be exposed to the world through an external IP address. Kubernetes supports Docker containers since its first version, and in July 2016 [[rkt (software)|rkt]] container engine was added.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/07/rktnetes-brings-rkt-container-engine-to-kubernetes/|title=rktnetes brings rkt container engine to Kubernetes|website=kubernetes.io}}</ref>\n\n=== Add-ons ===\nAdd-ons operate just like any other application running within the cluster: they are implemented via pods and services, and are only different in that they implement features of the Kubernetes cluster. The pods may be managed by Deployments, ReplicationControllers, and so on. There are many add-ons, and the list is growing. Some of the more important are:\n* DNS: All Kubernetes clusters should have cluster DNS; it is a mandatory feature. Cluster DNS is a DNS server, in addition to the other DNS server(s) in your environment, which serves DNS records for Kubernetes services. Containers started by Kubernetes automatically include this DNS server in their DNS searches.\n* Web UI: This is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster, as well as the cluster itself.\n* Container Resource Monitoring: Providing a reliable application runtime, and being able to scale it up or down in response to workloads, means being able to continuously and effectively monitor workload performance. Container Resource Monitoring provides this capability by recording metrics about containers in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data. The cAdvisor is a component on a slave node that provides a limited metric monitoring capability. There are full metrics pipelines as well, such as Prometheus, which can meet most monitoring needs.\n* Cluster-level logging: Logs should have a separate storage and lifecycle independent of nodes, pods, or containers. Otherwise, node or pod failures can cause loss of event data. The ability to do this is called cluster-level logging, and such mechanisms are responsible for saving container logs to a central log store with search/browsing interface. Kubernetes provides no native storage for log data, but one can integrate many existing logging solutions into the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n== Microservices ==\nKubernetes is commonly used as a way to host a microservice-based implementation, because it and its associated ecosystem of tools provide all the capabilities needed to address key concerns of any [[Microservices#A comparison of platforms|microservice architecture]].\n\n== Kubernetes Persistent Storage ==\nContainers emerged as a way to make software portable. The container contains all the packages you need to run a service. The provided filesystem makes containers extremely portable and easy to use in development. A container can be moved from development to test or production with no or relatively few configuration changes.\n\nHistorically Kubernetes was suitable only for stateless services. However, many applications have a database, which requires persistence, which leads to the creation of persistent storage for Kubernetes. Implementing persistent storage for containers is one of the top challenges of Kubernetes administrators, DevOps and cloud engineers. Containers may be ephemeral, but more and more of their data is not, so one needs to ensure the data's survival in case of container termination or hardware failure.\n\nWhen deploying containers with Kubernetes or containerized applications, companies often realize that they need persistent storage. They need to provide fast and reliable storage for databases, root images and other data used by the containers. Currently persistent storage for Kubernetes/storage for Kubernetes is offered by several storage providers - Portworx, Linstor ,StorPool Storage, StorageOS, NetApp and VMware.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[OpenShift]]\n* [[List of cluster management software]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://kubernetes.io/}}\n* {{GitHub|https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes|Source code}}\n{{Virtualization software}}\n{{Linux containers}}\n\n[[Category:2014 software]]\n[[Category:Cloud infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Containerization software]]\n[[Category:Free software for cloud computing]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Go]]\n[[Category:Linux Containerization]]\n[[Category:Linux Foundation projects]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apache license]]\n[[Category:Virtualization-related software for Linux]]\n", "name_user": "Remalyon", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix Cloud Native Computing Foundation link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes"}

[[Knight]]s would gallop in a circle while tossing balls from one to another; an activity that required great skill and horsemanship.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This game was introduced to Europe at the time of the [[Crusades]] from earlier [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab]] traditions. The word carousel originated from the Italian ''garosello'' and Spanish ''carosella'' (\"little battle\", used by crusaders to describe a combat preparation exercise and game played by [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and Arabian horsemen in the 12th century).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carouselmuseum.com/history.html|title=A Brief History of the Carousel|access-date=24 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304083147/http://carouselmuseum.com/history.html|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> This early device was essentially a cavalry training mechanism; it prepared and strengthened the riders for actual combat as they wielded their swords at the mock enemies.\n\nBy the 17th century, the balls had been dispensed with, and instead the riders had to spear small rings that were hanging from poles overhead and rip them off. Cavalry spectacles that replaced medieval [[jousting]], such as the ring-tilt, were popular in [[Italy]] and [[France]]. The game began to be played by commoners, and carousels soon sprung up at fairgrounds across Europe. At the [[Place du Carrousel]] in [[Paris]], an early make believe carousel was set up with wooden horses for the children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairsarefun.net/html/icon.aspx?id=21&p=4|title=Merry-go-rounds}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 18th century carousels were being built and operated at various fairs and gatherings in central Europe and England. Animals and mechanisms would be crafted during the winter months and the family and workers would go touring in their wagon train through the region, operating their large menagerie carousel at various venues. Makers included Heyn in [[Germany]] and Bayol in [[France]]. These early carousels had no platforms; the animals would hang from chains and fly out from the [[centrifugal force]] of the spinning mechanism. They were often powered by animals walking in a circle or people pulling a rope or cranking.\n\nBy 1803 [[John Joseph Merlin]] had a carousel in his Mechanical Museum in London, where gentry and nobility liked to gather on winter evenings. The horses \"floated free over a pole\". It was connected to a \"big musical instrument that played a fully orchestrated concerto\" and from the first note the carousel would start turning while each individual horse would make a galloping movement with a visitor riding on its back. Merlin did not patent his inventions and engineers were allowed to come to create their own models of his creations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EPgOAAAAQAAJ&dq=phantasmagorie&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=England, Wales, Irland und Schottland: Erinnerungen an Natur und Kunst aus einer Reise in den Jahren 1802 und 1803|first=Christian August Gottlieb|last=Goede|date=10 April 1804|publisher=Arnold|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Direction of rotation===\n[[File:Carousel-bunkyo-japan-2010.ogv|right|thumb|A carousel in [[Bunky\u014d, Tokyo|Bunkyo]], [[Japan]]]]\nViewed from above, in the [[United Kingdom]], merry-go-rounds, called \u2018gallopers\u2019 by the showmen community when populated by model horses, usually turn [[clockwise]] (from the outside, animals face to the left), while in [[North America]] and [[Continental Europe|Mainland Europe]], carousels typically go [[counterclockwise]] (animals face to the right).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanaantiques.net/index.php?p=page&page_id=Introduction-to-carousel-art|title=Introduction To Carousel Art: American Antiques &#124; American folk art &#124; carousel horse|website=www.americanaantiques.net}}</ref>\n\n===Modern carousels===\nBy the mid-19th century the platform carousel was developed; the animals and chariots were fixed to a circular floor that would suspend from a centre pole and rotate around. These carousels were called dobbies and were operated manually by the operator or by ponies.\n\nIn mid-19th century England, the carousel became a popular fixture at [[fair]]s. The first steam-powered mechanical roundabout, invented by Thomas Bradshaw, appeared at the [[Aylsham|Aylsham Fair]] in about 1861. It was described by a ''[[Johnston Press|Halifax Courier]]'' journalist as \"a roundabout of huge proportions, driven by a steam engine which whirled around with such impetuousity, that the wonder is the daring riders are not shot off like cannon- ball, and driven half into the middle of next month.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/rides/history.html\n |title=Fairground Rides \u2013 A Chronological Development\n |publisher=University of Sheffield\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811021142/https://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/rides/history.html\n |archivedate=11 August 2011\n \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sea-On-Land.jpg|thumb|right|260x260px|Savage's amusement ride, Sea-On-Land, where the riders would pitch up and down as if they were on the sea. His \"galloping horse\" innovation is seen on carousels today.]]\nSoon afterwards, English engineer Frederick Savage began to branch out of agricultural machinery production into the construction of fairground machines, swiftly becoming the chief innovator in the field. Savage's fairground machinery was exported all over the world.<ref name=\"Savage\">[https://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/-/media/museums/downloads/learning/kings-lynn/a-history-of-savages.pdf?la=en \"Frederick Savage, Victorian fairground manufacturer of King's Lynn\"].

Retrieved 25 February 2018</ref> By 1870, he was manufacturing carousels with [[Velocipede]]s (an early type of bicycle) and he soon began experimenting with other possibilities, including a roundabout with boats that would pitch and roll on cranks with a circular motion, a ride he called 'Sea-on-Land'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/learning/swings-and-roundabouts/|title=Swings and Roundabouts|first=Ken McMonigle, AWE|last=MEDIA}}</ref>\n\nSavage applied a similar innovation to the more traditional mount of the horse; he installed gears and offset cranks on the platform carousels, thus giving the animals their well-known up-and-down motion as they travelled around the center pole \u2013 the galloping horse.<ref name=\"Savage\"/> The platform served as a position guide for the bottom of the pole and as a place for people to walk or other stationary animals or chariots to be placed. He called this ride the 'Platform Gallopers' . He also developed the 'platform-slide' which allowed the mounts to swing out concentrically as the carousel built up speed. [[Fairground organ]]s (band organs) were often present (if not built in) when these machines operated. Eventually electric motors were installed and electric lights added, giving the carousel its classic look.\n\n[[File:Rochester NY Dentzel Carousel Summer 2001.jpg|left|thumb|Carousel built in 1905 by Gustav Dentzel which is still operational in [[Rochester, New York]].]]\nThese mechanical innovations came at a crucial time, when increased prosperity meant that more people had time for [[leisure]] and spare money to spend on entertainment. It was in this historical context that the modern fairground ride was born, with Savage supplying this new market demand.

Cavalry spectacles that replaced medieval [[jousting]], such as the ring-tilt, were popular in [[Italy]] and [[France]]. The game began to be played by commoners, and carousels soon sprung up at fairgrounds across Europe. At the [[Place du Carrousel]] in [[Paris]], an early make believe carousel was set up with wooden horses for the children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairsarefun.net/html/icon.aspx?id=21&p=4|title=Merry-go-rounds}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 18th century carousels were being built and operated at various fairs and gatherings in central Europe and England. Animals and mechanisms would be crafted during the winter months and the family and workers would go touring in their wagon train through the region, operating their large menagerie carousel at various venues. Makers included Heyn in [[Germany]] and Bayol in [[France]]. These early carousels had no platforms; the animals would hang from chains and fly out from the [[centrifugal force]] of the spinning mechanism. They were often powered by animals walking in a circle or people pulling a rope or cranking.\n\nBy 1803 [[John Joseph Merlin]] had a carousel in his Mechanical Museum in London, where gentry and nobility liked to gather on winter evenings. The horses \"floated free over a pole\". It was connected to a \"big musical instrument that played a fully orchestrated concerto\" and from the first note the carousel would start turning while each individual horse would make a galloping movement with a visitor riding on its back. Merlin did not patent his inventions and engineers were allowed to come to create their own models of his creations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=EPgOAAAAQAAJ&dq=phantasmagorie&pg=PA131#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=England, Wales, Irland und Schottland: Erinnerungen an Natur und Kunst aus einer Reise in den Jahren 1802 und 1803|first=Christian August Gottlieb|last=Goede|date=10 April 1804|publisher=Arnold|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Direction of rotation===\n[[File:Carousel-bunkyo-japan-2010.ogv|right|thumb|A carousel in [[Bunky\u014d, Tokyo|Bunkyo]], [[Japan]]]]\nViewed from above, in the [[United Kingdom]], merry-go-rounds, called \u2018gallopers\u2019 by the showmen community when populated by model horses, usually turn [[clockwise]] (from the outside, animals face to the left), while in [[North America]] and [[Continental Europe|Mainland Europe]], carousels typically go [[counterclockwise]] (animals face to the right).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanaantiques.net/index.php?p=page&page_id=Introduction-to-carousel-art|title=Introduction To Carousel Art: American Antiques &#124; American folk art &#124; carousel horse|website=www.americanaantiques.net}}</ref>\n\n===Modern carousels===\nBy the mid-19th century the platform carousel was developed; the animals and chariots were fixed to a circular floor that would suspend from a centre pole and rotate around. These carousels were called dobbies and were operated manually by the operator or by ponies.\n\nIn mid-19th century England, the carousel became a popular fixture at [[fair]]s. The first steam-powered mechanical roundabout, invented by Thomas Bradshaw, appeared at the [[Aylsham|Aylsham Fair]] in about 1861. It was described by a ''[[Johnston Press|Halifax Courier]]'' journalist as \"a roundabout of huge proportions, driven by a steam engine which whirled around with such impetuousity, that the wonder is the daring riders are not shot off like cannon- ball, and driven half into the middle of next month.\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/rides/history.html\n |title=Fairground Rides \u2013 A Chronological Development\n |publisher=University of Sheffield\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811021142/https://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/rides/history.html\n |archivedate=11 August 2011\n \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sea-On-Land.jpg|thumb|right|260x260px|Savage's amusement ride, Sea-On-Land, where the riders would pitch up and down as if they were on the sea.

Savage's fairground machinery was exported all over the world.<ref name=\"Savage\">[https://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/-/media/museums/downloads/learning/kings-lynn/a-history-of-savages.pdf?la=en \"Frederick Savage, Victorian fairground manufacturer of King's Lynn\"]. Norfolk.gov.uk. Retrieved 25 February 2018</ref> By 1870, he was manufacturing carousels with [[Velocipede]]s (an early type of bicycle) and he soon began experimenting with other possibilities, including a roundabout with boats that would pitch and roll on cranks with a circular motion, a ride he called 'Sea-on-Land'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/learning/swings-and-roundabouts/|title=Swings and Roundabouts|first=Ken McMonigle, AWE|last=MEDIA}}</ref>\n\nSavage applied a similar innovation to the more traditional mount of the horse; he installed gears and offset cranks on the platform carousels, thus giving the animals their well-known up-and-down motion as they travelled around the center pole \u2013 the galloping horse.<ref name=\"Savage\"/> The platform served as a position guide for the bottom of the pole and as a place for people to walk or other stationary animals or chariots to be placed. He called this ride the 'Platform Gallopers' . He also developed the 'platform-slide' which allowed the mounts to swing out concentrically as the carousel built up speed. [[Fairground organ]]s (band organs) were often present (if not built in) when these machines operated. Eventually electric motors were installed and electric lights added, giving the carousel its classic look.\n\n[[File:Rochester NY Dentzel Carousel Summer 2001.jpg|left|thumb|Carousel built in 1905 by Gustav Dentzel which is still operational in [[Rochester, New York]].]]\nThese mechanical innovations came at a crucial time, when increased prosperity meant that more people had time for [[leisure]] and spare money to spend on entertainment. It was in this historical context that the modern fairground ride was born, with Savage supplying this new market demand. In his 1902 Catalogue for Roundabouts he claimed to have \"...&nbsp;patented and placed upon the market all the principal novelties that have delighted the many thousands of pleasure seekers at home and abroad.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Frederick Savage, Victorian Fairground Manufacturer of King\u2019s Lynn|url=http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC095974|access-date=7 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213000441/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC095974|archive-date=13 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the carousel industry was developed by immigrants, notably [[Gustav Dentzel]] of Germany and Charles W.F.
