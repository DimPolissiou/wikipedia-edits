They are found in many parts of the world, such as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], northern [[Russia]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]]. [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Huts are basic and unmanned, without running water. \n\n==Bothy==\nA [[bothy]] is a basic shelter, usually left unlocked and available for anyone to use free of charge. They are found in remote mountainous areas of [[Scotland]], [[Northern England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. Most are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, [[mattress]]es or [[blanket]]s are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by [[bicycle]] or boat. Most bothies have a [[fireplace]] and are near a natural source of [[water]]. A [[spade]] may be provided to bury [[excrement]].<ref>[https://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/bothies/what-is-a-bothy/ \"What is a bothy\", Mountain Bothies Association.]</ref>\n\n== ''Biwakschachteln'' ==\nShelters, known in [[German language|German]] as ''Biwakschachtel'', or [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac box]], can also be found in remote areas of the [[Alps]]. Even though ''Biwakschachteln'' are also tended to by [[Alpine Club]]s, they differ markedly from other [[mountain hut]]s, because they do not have a permanent resident who tends to the building and provides food and refreshments.<ref>[https://www.bergzeit.de/magazin/biwakschachtel-alpen-notunterkunft/ Arnold Zimprich, \"Biwakschachteln in den Alpen: Infos & Tipps zur Notunterkunft\". ''Bergzeit'' magazine, 7 May 2019]</ref> There are eight [[Alpine countries]] (from west to east): [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Monaco]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], and [[Slovenia]].<ref>[http://www.alpconv.org/index_en \"Alpine Convention\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729001545/http://www.alpconv.org/index_en |date=July 29, 2011|url-access=subscription}}</ref>. \n[[File:Birkkarhuetterl 20111016.jpg|thumb|Biwakschachtel, or bivouac box. The Birkkarh\u00fctte at 2635m near the [[Birkkarspitze]] (2,749 metres),the highest peak in the [[Karwendel Mountains]], [[Austrian Tyrol]]]]\n\nThe [[Solvay Hut]] or Solvay Bivouac ([[H\u00f6rnli Ridge]]) of the [[Matterhorn]], near [[Zermatt]], Switzerland. At 4,003 metres (13,133 ft) it is the highest mountain hut owned by the [[Swiss Alpine Club]], but can be used only in case of emergency.<ref>[http://www.vs-wallis.ch/wallis/huetten/solvay.html Solvayh\u00fctte]</ref>\n\n== ''Boofen'' ==\nAn even simpler shelter is found in the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] of German-speaking [[Saxon Switzerland]] where climbers refer to overnighting in the open air as ''Boofen'' (pronounced \"bo-fen\"). The spot selected for overnight stays usually comprises an overhang in the sandstone rock or a cave, the so-called ''Boofe'' (\"bo-fe\"). This has often been adapted with a sleeping area and fireplace. In the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park|national park]] itself, ''Boofen'' is only permitted at designated sites and only in connection with climbing, although in this case lighting fires is absolutely forbidden. The colloquial [[Thuringian dialect|Saxon]] word ''boofen'' was derived from ''pofen'' (= sleep soundly and for a long time). \n\n==Huts by country==\n\n===Finland===\n[[File:Oahujoki wilderness hut in Lemmenjoki National Park, Inari (August 2019, 1).jpg|thumb|The Oahujoki wilderness hut in [[Lemmenjoki National Park]], Finland, can accommodate seven people overnight.]]\n\nOfficial wilderness huts are mostly maintained by [[Mets\u00e4hallitus]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for ''Administration of Forests''), the Finnish state-owned forest management company. Most of the wilderness huts in Finland are situated in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Their size can vary greatly: the Lahtinen cottage in the [[Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area]] can barely hold two people, whereas the Luiroj\u00e4rvi cottage in the [[Urho Kekkonen National Park]] can hold as many as 16.\n\nA wilderness hut need not be reserved beforehand, and they are open for everyone tracking by foot, ski or similar means. Commercial stays overnight are prohibited in the wilderness huts owned by Mets\u00e4hallitus.  Unofficial and unmaintained huts also exist.\n\nFor centuries the vast wildernesses of Finland and its resources were divided amongst the Finnish agricultural societies (such as families, villages, parishes, and provinces) for the purpose of collecting resources. Areas divided in this way were called ''er\u00e4maa'', literally \"portion-land,\" (now literally the word for \"wilderness\" in modern Finnish). People from agricultural societies made trips to their ''er\u00e4maas'' in the summer, mainly to trap animals for [[fur]] but also to hunt game, fish, and collect taxes from the local hunter-fisher population.\n\nHuts were built in the wilderness for use as base camps for hunters and fishermen. Also non-agricultural [[Sami people]] built huts to help them manage reindeer. The earliest huts were only allowed to be used by people from the communities that owned them. Outsiders were not allowed to use the resources of other communities' ''er\u00e4maas''.\n\nHuts that were free for everyone were first seen in late 18th century Finland, when dwelling places were built along walking routes for passers-by. In the 19th century the authorities started building these huts. Later in the 20th century they started to be built for travellers.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{See also|Tramping in New Zealand}}\n\n[[New Zealand]] has a network of approximately 950 backcountry huts.<ref name=\"NZ-Huts\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/backcountry-hut-information/ |title=Backcountry hut information: Places to stay |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  The huts are officially maintained by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC), although some of the huts have been adopted and maintained by local [[hiking]] and hunting clubs by arrangement.  There are also unofficial and privately owned huts in some places. They vary from small [[bivouac shelter]]s made of wood to large modern huts that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.\n\nSome huts were initially commissioned or built by clubs along commonly walked routes, both for safety reasons as appropriate, and sometimes for convenience.  The network of back-country huts in New Zealand was largely extended in the mid-20th-century, when many more were built to serve the deer cullers of the [[New Zealand Forest Service]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/east-coast/te-urewera/te-totara-hut/ |title=Historic Te Totara Hut: Te Urewera |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  Most larger and more modern huts, like some found on the [[New Zealand Great Walks|Great Walks]], have been purpose designed and built to serve [[Tramping|trampers]]. Many of New Zealand's back-country huts are remote and rarely visited, and it is common for recreational trampers to design trips with the idea of reaching and visiting specific huts. Some people actively keep count of which huts they have visited, a practice which is informally referred to as hut bagging.\n\n[[File:Waiopehu Hut Pass.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand backcountry hut pass]]\n\nBack-country huts in New Zealand were free to use until the early 1990s, when the New Zealand Department of Conservation began charging for their use. For most back-country huts, nightly hut tickets are purchased via an honesty system by people who use the huts, with an additional option of purchasing an annual pass for people who use huts frequently. Huts on frequently used and heavily marketed tracks, such as the [[New Zealand Great Walks]], usually operate on a booking system, and often have resident wardens checking the bookings of users who arrive to stay the night.<ref name=NZ-Huts/>\n\nSince the inception of hut fees in New Zealand, there has been controversy amongst some hut users. Many users belong to clubs which helped to build and maintain the huts before the government department was created, and consequently inherited them. It is common to find people who refuse to pay for the use of huts in protest, arguing that the government is trying to charge them to use facilities that they themselves are entirely responsible for providing. DOC argues that all hut fees are used for the continued maintenance of huts, and for building new huts as appropriate. It has at times made efforts to demonstrate this by specifically allocating money from hut fees towards budgets for these purposes.\n\nThe majority of the huts were built in an era of lower levels of government regulation and the long term use of the huts was not considered.  As a result of the [[Cave Creek disaster]] in 1995, DOC tightened up on the standards for structures on public land.  Some of the huts were upgraded to meet build regulations whilst others were removed or had certain facilities (such as beds) removed to cause them to fall into less strict building categories. In 2008, because of the recognition of the unique situation and the remote locations, the government relaxed the building standards for the huts. They now no longer need to have emergency lighting, smoke alarms, wheelchair access, potable water supplies or artificial lighting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/building-rule-changes-reduce-red-tape-huts |title=Building rule changes reduce red tape for huts |date=2008-10-31 |publisher=New Zealand Government |access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Pocosin cabin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Pocosin cabin along the [[Appalachian Trail]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]].]] \t\nIn the [[United States of America|United States]], backcountry huts may be provided by the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], state or national parks such as the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/backcountry-camping.htm Great Smoky Mountains National Park - Backcountry Camping - Backpacking (U.S. National Park Service)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wilderness huts are frequently located along hiking routes.\n\nThe Tenth Mountain Huts is a system of 29 backcountry huts in the Colorado Rocky Mountains honoring the men of [[10th Mountain Division]] of the [[US Army]], who trained during [[World War II]] at [[Camp Hale]] in central Colorado.

They are found in many parts of the world, such as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], northern [[Russia]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]]. [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Huts are basic and unmanned, without running water. \n\n==Bothy==\nA [[bothy]] is a basic shelter, usually left unlocked and available for anyone to use free of charge. They are found in remote mountainous areas of [[Scotland]], [[Northern England]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. Most are ruined buildings which have been restored to a basic standard, providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box up to two-storey cottages. They usually have designated sleeping areas, which commonly are either an upstairs room or a raised platform, thus allowing one to keep clear of cold air and draughts at floor height. No bedding, [[mattress]]es or [[blanket]]s are provided. Public access to bothies is either on foot, by [[bicycle]] or boat. Most bothies have a [[fireplace]] and are near a natural source of [[water]]. A [[spade]] may be provided to bury [[excrement]].<ref>[https://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/bothies/what-is-a-bothy/ \"What is a bothy\", Mountain Bothies Association.]</ref>\n\n== ''Biwakschachteln'' ==\nShelters, known in [[German language|German]] as ''Biwakschachtel'', or [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac box]], can also be found in remote areas of the [[Alps]]. Even though ''Biwakschachteln'' are also tended to by [[Alpine Club]]s, they differ markedly from other [[mountain hut]]s, because they do not have a permanent resident who tends to the building and provides food and refreshments.<ref>[https://www.bergzeit.de/magazin/biwakschachtel-alpen-notunterkunft/ Arnold Zimprich, \"Biwakschachteln in den Alpen: Infos & Tipps zur Notunterkunft\".

The spot selected for overnight stays usually comprises an overhang in the sandstone rock or a cave, the so-called ''Boofe'' (\"bo-fe\"). This has often been adapted with a sleeping area and fireplace. In the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park|national park]] itself, ''Boofen'' is only permitted at designated sites and only in connection with climbing, although in this case lighting fires is absolutely forbidden. The colloquial [[Thuringian dialect|Saxon]] word ''boofen'' was derived from ''pofen'' (= sleep soundly and for a long time). \n\n==Huts by country==\n\n===Finland===\n[[File:Oahujoki wilderness hut in Lemmenjoki National Park, Inari (August 2019, 1).jpg|thumb|The Oahujoki wilderness hut in [[Lemmenjoki National Park]], Finland, can accommodate seven people overnight.]]\n\nOfficial wilderness huts are mostly maintained by [[Mets\u00e4hallitus]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for ''Administration of Forests''), the Finnish state-owned forest management company. Most of the wilderness huts in Finland are situated in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Their size can vary greatly: the Lahtinen cottage in the [[Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area]] can barely hold two people, whereas the Luiroj\u00e4rvi cottage in the [[Urho Kekkonen National Park]] can hold as many as 16.\n\nA wilderness hut need not be reserved beforehand, and they are open for everyone tracking by foot, ski or similar means. Commercial stays overnight are prohibited in the wilderness huts owned by Mets\u00e4hallitus.  Unofficial and unmaintained huts also exist.\n\nFor centuries the vast wildernesses of Finland and its resources were divided amongst the Finnish agricultural societies (such as families, villages, parishes, and provinces) for the purpose of collecting resources. Areas divided in this way were called ''er\u00e4maa'', literally \"portion-land,\" (now literally the word for \"wilderness\" in modern Finnish). People from agricultural societies made trips to their ''er\u00e4maas'' in the summer, mainly to trap animals for [[fur]] but also to hunt game, fish, and collect taxes from the local hunter-fisher population.\n\nHuts were built in the wilderness for use as base camps for hunters and fishermen. Also non-agricultural [[Sami people]] built huts to help them manage reindeer. The earliest huts were only allowed to be used by people from the communities that owned them. Outsiders were not allowed to use the resources of other communities' ''er\u00e4maas''.\n\nHuts that were free for everyone were first seen in late 18th century Finland, when dwelling places were built along walking routes for passers-by. In the 19th century the authorities started building these huts. Later in the 20th century they started to be built for travellers.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{See also|Tramping in New Zealand}}\n\n[[New Zealand]] has a network of approximately 950 backcountry huts.<ref name=\"NZ-Huts\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/backcountry-hut-information/ |title=Backcountry hut information: Places to stay |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  The huts are officially maintained by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC), although some of the huts have been adopted and maintained by local [[hiking]] and hunting clubs by arrangement.  There are also unofficial and privately owned huts in some places. They vary from small [[bivouac shelter]]s made of wood to large modern huts that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.\n\nSome huts were initially commissioned or built by clubs along commonly walked routes, both for safety reasons as appropriate, and sometimes for convenience.  The network of back-country huts in New Zealand was largely extended in the mid-20th-century, when many more were built to serve the deer cullers of the [[New Zealand Forest Service]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/east-coast/te-urewera/te-totara-hut/ |title=Historic Te Totara Hut: Te Urewera |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>  Most larger and more modern huts, like some found on the [[New Zealand Great Walks|Great Walks]], have been purpose designed and built to serve [[Tramping|trampers]]. Many of New Zealand's back-country huts are remote and rarely visited, and it is common for recreational trampers to design trips with the idea of reaching and visiting specific huts. Some people actively keep count of which huts they have visited, a practice which is informally referred to as hut bagging.\n\n[[File:Waiopehu Hut Pass.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand backcountry hut pass]]\n\nBack-country huts in New Zealand were free to use until the early 1990s, when the New Zealand Department of Conservation began charging for their use. For most back-country huts, nightly hut tickets are purchased via an honesty system by people who use the huts, with an additional option of purchasing an annual pass for people who use huts frequently. Huts on frequently used and heavily marketed tracks, such as the [[New Zealand Great Walks]], usually operate on a booking system, and often have resident wardens checking the bookings of users who arrive to stay the night.<ref name=NZ-Huts/>\n\nSince the inception of hut fees in New Zealand, there has been controversy amongst some hut users. Many users belong to clubs which helped to build and maintain the huts before the government department was created, and consequently inherited them. It is common to find people who refuse to pay for the use of huts in protest, arguing that the government is trying to charge them to use facilities that they themselves are entirely responsible for providing. DOC argues that all hut fees are used for the continued maintenance of huts, and for building new huts as appropriate. It has at times made efforts to demonstrate this by specifically allocating money from hut fees towards budgets for these purposes.\n\nThe majority of the huts were built in an era of lower levels of government regulation and the long term use of the huts was not considered.  As a result of the [[Cave Creek disaster]] in 1995, DOC tightened up on the standards for structures on public land.  Some of the huts were upgraded to meet build regulations whilst others were removed or had certain facilities (such as beds) removed to cause them to fall into less strict building categories. In 2008, because of the recognition of the unique situation and the remote locations, the government relaxed the building standards for the huts. They now no longer need to have emergency lighting, smoke alarms, wheelchair access, potable water supplies or artificial lighting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/building-rule-changes-reduce-red-tape-huts |title=Building rule changes reduce red tape for huts |date=2008-10-31 |publisher=New Zealand Government |access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Pocosin cabin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Pocosin cabin along the [[Appalachian Trail]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]].]] \t\nIn the [[United States of America|United States]], backcountry huts may be provided by the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], state or national parks such as the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/backcountry-camping.htm Great Smoky Mountains National Park - Backcountry Camping - Backpacking (U.S. National Park Service)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wilderness huts are frequently located along hiking routes.\n\nThe Tenth Mountain Huts is a system of 29 backcountry huts in the Colorado Rocky Mountains honoring the men of [[10th Mountain Division]] of the [[US Army]], who trained during [[World War II]] at [[Camp Hale]] in central Colorado.

He is the archetypal [[mad scientist]].\n\nThe Other Universe version of Walter Bishop, nicknamed {{anchord|Walternate}}, is the [[United States Secretary of Defense]], and directly oversees the alternate and more powerful Fringe division. He is the main antagonist of the third season. Walternate also serves as the immediate superior to the shapeshifters, with their leader\u2014Thomas Jerome Newton\u2014being extremely loyal and protective of him (possibly being friends).

It is in this same episode that we are offered a peek into the home lives of the two Astrids and why they might be so different. We learn that while both Astrids' mothers died when they were young, and they were both raised by their fathers, that alternate universe Astrid felt a sense of rejection and disapproval from her father, while the Astrid in the primary universe had a warm, loving father, whom she was close to (though she lies about this in an attempt to console her counterpart). However it is ambiguous as to whether this is a cause or effect, as alternate universe Astrid seemed to be under the impression that her father was distant due to the way she was, not that she was the way she was because he was distant, while we know nothing of how the primary universe Astrid may have been as a child.\n\n===Phillip Broyles===\n'''Phillip Broyles''' (portrayed by [[Lance Reddick]]; main: season 1\u20134; recurring: season 5) is a [[Homeland Security]] Special Agent and head of the Fringe division, which was established to investigate a series of terrorist/unexplained phenomena.

The showdown between the two Fringe divisions leaves Lee with third degree burns covering 90% of his body. Thanks to the advanced nanotechnology known in the other dimension, Lee does not stay away from duty for long, and after a three months medical treatment he is completely recovered.\n\nLee is a capable agent and a devoted friend to his fellow Fringe division agents, risking his health by prematurely leaving his nano-regeneration chamber to help them. Lee seems to care deeply for Fauxlivia and even attempted kissing her before learning she had a boyfriend. He seems to be very bad at keeping secrets, as he immediately tells Fauxlivia that her fianc\u00e9 intends to propose to her after having been told in confidence. He is in charge of the Fringe division after the death of the alternate Colonel Broyles. At first he seems to doubt himself, saying that he \"feels like he's missing something, that Broyles would see something he wouldn't\" (\"[[Immortality (Fringe)|Immortality]]\") but he gains more confidence after apprehending the culprit.<ref name=immortality/>\n\nThe alternate timeline Lincoln Lee of the prime universe is an FBI Special Agent, and is distinguished by his use of eyeglasses and generally more clean cut appearance than his parallel universe counterpart. In the episode \"[[Everything in Its Right Place (Fringe)|Everything in Its Right Place]]\", the prime and parallel versions of Lincoln Lee both grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey until their moms died and then their dads moved them to Philadelphia, both fathers started an Ace Hardware, they both attended Hamilton High School, both had Mr. Glasberg as their 10th grade science teacher, they both graduated with a 3.85 GPA and both slacked off in their senior years to work at their dads' stores, and they both didn't go to prom because they both had just broken up with Alicia Dvoskin. Despite identical life experiences, at some point their lives bifurcated in opposite directions with the prime Lincoln Lee lacking confidence and the parallel Lincoln Lee being quite confident.  The parallel Lincoln Lee theorized that it was because he made a conscious choice to become that confident man. He's from Hartford, Connecticut.<ref name=stowaway/> Agent Broyles originally introduces him to the Fringe Division in order to consult on the case of a seemingly immortal woman, to which he had been assigned after her family was gruesomely murdered. He is at first confused by the bizarre antics of the agents and the seemingly impossible situations they investigate, but he seems to quickly take it in stride, becoming enthusiastic about the work and offering them his help whenever they need it.<ref name=stowaway/> This version of Agent Lee has also developed some romantic feelings towards Olivia, but does not fully act upon them due to the complications caused by the return of Peter. His alternate universe counterpart is killed in a shootout during Season 4, and prime universe Agent Lee stays in the alternate universe both to investigate David Robert Jones and because he feels less of a third wheel than with prime Olivia and Peter.

He is placed in a medically induced coma, and during this time [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] devises a procedure to link his mind to Olivia's in order to gain information about the suspect who caused the explosion. With that information, they locate the suspect, from whom they gain the necessary understanding of the chemical to cure John. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that John himself financed the creation of the toxin. This connection ties him to \"the Pattern\", the incidents investigated by the Fringe Division, making him a suspected terrorist. A subsequent high-speed chase results in John's death, leaving Olivia to question not only John's true loyalty, but also his love for her.<ref name=pilotepisode/>\n\nFollowing his death, John's corpse is secretly delivered to Massive Dynamic, to serve as an information gathering source.<ref name=pilotepisode/>\n\nAs a result of their mental link, part of John's consciousness is transferred to Olivia, allowing her to communicate with him through hallucinations and dreams.

In the second season finale, he helps Walter and Olivia to evade capture in the parallel universe, and then assists Walter in preparing equipment for them to return to the prime universe; William and Walter reestablish their friendship when William reminds Walter why he had removed the brain pieces. When Olivia returns with Peter, Bell is unable to cross over again, as his atoms would split apart and no trace of him would remain in either universe. Because of this, he sacrifices himself to provide the means for Walter, Peter, and Olivia (in actuality, the alternate Olivia) to return to the prime universe. With William now dead in both universes, Walter discovers at the start of Season 3 that William left the whole of Massive Dynamic to him in his will.\n\nAs explained by William at the end of Season 2, the alternate version of William was killed as a young man in a car accident;<ref name=overtherepart2/> as a result, Massive Dynamic in the parallel world was never formed, instead there is only Bishop Dynamic.\n\nIn season three, Walter remembers that William had an idea of developing \"soul magnets\", devices that would channel the energy from a dead body into another entity. Walter figures that William must have created a soul magnet for himself and figures that the trigger is the frequency created by the bell William left for Nina. Walter rings it and William's consciousness appears in Olivia.<ref name=osepisode/> \"Bellivia\" explains that he put the soul magnets in Olivia's tea when they first met in the other universe. Broyles gives William 48 hours to find a new viable host for him and get out of Olivia's body, but William takes his time as he knows that no harm is coming to Olivia. However, not too long after, Olivia regains control of her body briefly, confused and in a trance before William takes back over. William then explains that there is something more complicated than he expected.<ref name=stowaway>{{cite episode |title=Stowaway |episodelink=Stowaway (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]] (director), Danielle Dispaltro (teleplay), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (story), [[J.

After Walter and Peter \"die\" within her mind, William aids Olivia in escaping until she is able to confront her own fears, enabling her to take back control of her body. William tells Olivia to pass on the message \"I knew the dog wouldn't hunt\" to Walter. He then departs from Olivia's consciousness. As Olivia wakes up, Astrid and Walter realise that William's plan to transfer his own consciousness into a computer has failed. Olivia relays William's message to Walter, who explains that the message was a phrase William would use in earlier experiments when he knew that they would not be successful, and that his reason for suggesting it was because \"William hates goodbyes\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lysergic Acid Diethylamide |episodelink=Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[J.

Disbelieving Nina, Walter returns to St. Claire's Mental Institution and finds the scent of Bell among one of the log books that dated back to when Walter believed he had visited, and continues to assert this claim. After sending David Robert Jones to his demise, he kidnaps Walter, who has deduced that he is alive, and takes him onto his container ship to sail to his new universe. After Peter and Olivia rescue Walter, Bell rings his ship's bell and disappears. Broyles later notes that he was never found.\n\nWilliam returns in the future, trapped in amber with the Fringe team in 2036. Walter cuts off his hand and tells Astrid to not tell anyone, until in [[Five-Twenty-Ten]], he used it to unlock a storage facility and retrieve part of the plan.\n\n===Brandon Fayette===\n[[File:Ryan Mcdonald.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Ryan McDonald (actor)|Ryan McDonald]] plays Brandon Fayette]]\n'''Brandon Fayette''' (portrayed by [[Ryan McDonald (actor)|Ryan McDonald]]) is the leading scientist at Massive Dynamic, offering assistance to the Fringe team on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Other Universe version of Brandon is the chief scientist of the Fringe division, often answering directly to Secretary Bishop, and responsible for the assimilation of Olivia into Fauxlivia. Walternate deduced that he became a shapeshifter and killed him.\n\n===David Robert Jones===\n[[File:Jared Harris 2014.jpg|160px|thumb|left|[[Jared Harris]] played David Robert Jones]]\n'''David Robert Jones''' (portrayed by [[Jared Harris]]) is a biochemist and former employee of William Bell and Massive Dynamic, a connection that wasn't revealed until the [[There's More Than One of Everything|season one finale]].<ref name=s1finaleepisode/> Over the course of the first season, he is also proven to be the leader of ZFT, the organization responsible for most incidents investigated by the Fringe Division during season one.\n\nFirst appearing in the series while incarcerated in a German prison in the episode \"[[In Which We Meet Mr. Jones]]\", Jones soon becomes the main antagonist of season 1.  He is first shown whilst being contacted by [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]], who is trying to find the antidote for a parasite in Agent Loeb's body. Jones agrees to help her, but only in exchange for the opportunity to ask an associate one question. The response is a coded message picked up by Loeb, who is secretly working for Jones.<ref name=mrjonesepisode/>\n\nReceiving Jones' message, Loeb is soon able to proceed in creating a teleportation device once designed by [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]], and successfully teleports Jones out of prison, freeing him.\n\nIn \"[[Ability (Fringe)|Ability]]\" Jones turns himself over to the FBI, in exchange for Walter's help with the life-threatening side-effects of his teleportation. He then presents Olivia with a test: to prevent a biological bomb from detonating by turning off a series of lights only using her mind. Eventually, Olivia is able to do this, thanks to Walter's and Bell's Cortexiphan experiments conducted on her when she was a child. Jones then disappears again, leaving only a cryptic message: \"You Passed\".<ref name=abilityepisode/>\n\nIn the Season 1 finale, Jones' former relationship to William Bell is revealed, as is his goal of trying to escape to the parallel universe to confront Bell, who Jones believes never saw his true potential. Everything done by Jones since his introduction in the series has been either to get in contact with Bell, or to prove himself worthy of Bell's approval.<ref name=s1finaleepisode/>\n\nHe finally succeeds in opening a portal to the parallel universe, where Bell is located. However, the portal is dangerously unstable, threatening to cause severe harm to both universes. Peter is able to close the portal in time for it not to result in any real disaster. Jones, being only halfway through the portal, is cut in half and dies immediately.<ref name=s1finaleepisode/>\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"[[Back to Where You've Never Been]]\", David Robert Jones returns as a character in the alternate timeline created by Peter Bishop's deletion at the end of Season 3. With Peter's removal, Jones appears to have survived the portal crossing and is present in the alternate universe. He is revealed to be behind the \"Human Shapeshifters\" that are plaguing both universes and the alternate Broyles and Brandon appear to be under his control.<ref name=enemyofmyenemy/><ref name=backtowhere>{{cite episode |title=Back to Where You've Never Been |episodelink=Back to Where You've Never Been |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Jeannot Szwarc]] (director), [[David Fury]] (writer), [[Graham Roland]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2012-01-13 |season=4 |number=8}}</ref> At the end of season 4, he is electrocuted, causing him to disintegrate as an added effect of his earlier use of the teleportation device.\n\nDavid Robert Jones is the birth name of [[David Bowie]], who played a character named Thomas Jerome Newton in ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''.\n\n===September (The Observer)===\n[[File:Michael Cerveris 2007.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Michael Cerveris]] played September ''The Observer'']]\n{{anchor|September|The Observer}}\n'''September''' (portrayed by [[Michael Cerveris]]), often referred to as '''The Observer''', is a mysterious figure seen at the scene of many Pattern-related events. Like other Observers that have appeared on the show, September is only seen [[men in Black|wearing a plain black suit and black fedora]], and is pale, bald, and lacks eyebrows. They exhibit several strange mannerisms such as awkward phrasing when talking, a preference for extremely flavored, like spicy or salty foods due to an extremely dulled sense of taste, and the ability to appear or disappear when one looks away. They also use an alien written language with which they maintain copious documentation in small notebooks. Though the Fringe division is aware of the Observers, their intent is not yet known, though believed to be related to the Machine and the conflict between the two universes. They possess uniquely advanced technology, and appear to be temporally aware of time, including the ability to travel in time and between the two universes; the Fringe division finds evidence of Observers at several historical events but looking the same as they do in the present. Like September, the other Observers appear to be named after months, including \"August\" and \"December\". The episode \"[[Inner Child (Fringe)|Inner Child]]\" introduces the Fringe division to a child that appears to possess many Observer-like qualities.<ref name=innerchild>{{cite episode |title=Inner Child |episodelink=Inner Child (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Fred Toye]] (director), [[Julia Cho]] (writer), [[Brad Caleb Kane]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate= 2009-04-07 |season=1 |number=15}}</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Peter (Fringe episode)|Peter]]\", September is a catalyst in Walter's abduction of Peter from the parallel universe; September arrived wanting to see the creation of the cure by Walternate that would have saved Peter, but instead distracted Walternate from witnessing a critical test result. When September saw Walter watching through the window-like device, he informed his fellow Observers that he could correct the situation; later, after Walter returned with young Peter to the prime universe and fell through the frozen lake's ice, September rescued them from the freezing water and told Walter, \"The child must live\".\n\nSeptember and the other Observers have since monitored Walter and Peter. In the second season's finale, September is responsible for alerting the Fringe division to the dangers of Peter being taken back by Walternate to the parallel universe, ultimately leading to their rescue attempt. In the third season episode \"[[The Firefly (Fringe)|The Firefly]]\", September conducts a convoluted experiment to test Walter's resolve to give up Peter for the greater good when the time comes.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Firefly|episodelink=The Firefly (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]] (director), [[J.H.

However, at the last moment, he disobeys his orders and deactivates the device, allowing brief apparitions of Peter to appear to Walter and Olivia.\n\nIn \"[[Novation (Fringe)|Novation]]\" Peter mysteriously appears in the new timeline. After being taken into custody by the Fringe Division, he learns that the point of divergence in the timeline is that September never saved him from drowning in Reiden Lake when Walter brought him over from the alternate universe. He also learns that, in the new timeline, the Fringe Division is unaware of the existence of the Observers.\n\nSeptember later [[Back to Where You've Never Been|appears]] to Olivia while she waits for Peter and Lincoln to return from the alternate universe. Mysteriously wounded from a gunshot to the chest, he warns Olivia that he has seen all of the possible timelines, and the result is always the same: Olivia has to die. He then disappears before Olivia can call an ambulance to help him.<ref name=backtowhere/>\n\nHe resurfaces several episodes later in \"[[The End of All Things]]\", during Peter and Walter's search for the kidnapped Olivia, where he appears in Walter's lab, and is dying from the gunshot wound. In an attempt to discover the location of Olivia, Peter enters September's mind using the same method Olivia used to enter John's in the pilot. September has no information on Olivia, but does tell Peter that the Observers come from the future to observe their beginnings, and explains that he has interfered in the past. It is explained that this was an attempt to correct the timeline after accidentally preventing Walternate from discovering the cure to save Peter, thus beginning a chain of events that led to the war between the two universes. He also cryptically says, \"they are coming\". Before Peter can ask who, September tells Peter to \"go home\" and yanks him out of his mind. In the real world, September disappears from the lab, having been taken by the others.\n\nIn the next episode it is revealed that he planted a message in the form of a black dot in Peter's eye which contains an address in New York. Peter goes to the address to discover Observer technology in an apartment and a cylinder like the one in \"[[The Arrival (Fringe)|The Arrival]]\" which teleports a fully healed September to the apartment. Peter begs September to send him back to the original timeline but September assures him that this is where he is meant to be before teleporting away.\n\nIn the [[Fringe (season 5)|5th season]] episodes \"[[Anomaly XB-6783746]]\" and \"[[The Boy Must Live]]\", it is revealed that after the events of the fourth season, the Observers removed September's observer technology and conducted \"biological reversion\" experiments on him, causing him to transform into a human. As a human, he assumed the name '''Donald O'Connor'''.<ref name=anomaly/>\n\nAn Observer (either September or a different unnamed Observer) appeared in every episode of ''Fringe'', albeit sometimes only as a brief cameo.<ref name=\"sightings\">[http://fringe-theobserver.blogspot.com/ The Observer Sightings]</ref> As a tie-in with the show, actors playing Observers appeared in the audience of other FOX network shows, including ''[[American Idol]]'' and the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/04/08/fringe-american/ | title = 'Fringe' invades 'American Idol'... or was it the other way around? | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate = 2009-04-08 | first=Ken| last=Tucker| date = 2011-04-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002474.html | title = Fringe element haunts Fox shows | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-04-30 | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date = 2009-04-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn creating the Observers, the producers had some idea of how they would be introduced into the show, starting as a background character and only becoming a significant figure by the midpoint of the first season.<ref name=\"fearnet observers\"/> Though they had some idea of the Observers' role, they gave Cerveris much leeway to develop the character in the manner he wanted, from choosing the outfit he would wear to his language mannerisms.<ref name=\"fearnet observers\">{{cite web | url  =http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b22326_exclusive_michael_cerveris_observes.html | title = Exclusive: Michael Cerveris Observes the 'Fringe' Season 3 Finale! | first = Joseph | last = McCabe | date = 2011-04-11 | accessdate = 2011-07-03 | publisher = [[Fear.net]] }}</ref> Cerveris further is credited with creating the written Observer language during his scenes in \"The Arrival\", which the production team later extrapolated into a complete language for the show.<ref name=\"fringe props\">{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3nNq55_y6M | title = FRINGE - Show and Tell  | publisher = [[Fox Entertainment]] | date =2011-06-30 | accessdate= 2011-06-30 | medium = Television production | format = [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] | people = Robert K.

They are able to take the form of any person by using a device that plugs into the roof of their mouth and the mouth of the target. This process occurs after the shapeshifter has killed the target prior to the transformation; without the device, the shapeshifter is locked in its current form. Shapeshifters also may be programmed as sleeper agents, unaware of their unusual nature until they are activated. The primary characteristic differentiates a human and a shapeshifter is the large quantity of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in their blood, and the presence of a metallic data disc at the base of their spine. William Bell believes the shapeshifters were designed this way to withstand travel between the universes.\n\nThe first shapeshifter witnessed by the Fringe division is one that follows Olivia after her meeting with William from the parallel world in the second season premiere, \"[[A New Day in the Old Town]]\". He eventually kills Charlie and takes his place,<ref name=newdayoldtown/> using his position to find the location of Newton before he is identified by Olivia and killed.<ref name=momentumdeferred/> Several other shapeshifters have been shown in the series, including one that aids in the parallel universe's Olivia's escape from the prime universe.\n\nPeter Bishop later takes it upon himself to kill all of the remaining shapeshifters in the Prime Universe, after he is able to decode their sleeper identities from the files on Fauxlivia's computer. He successfully kills all of the ones identified, but it remains to be seen if he eliminated all of them.<ref name=reciprocity/>\n\n===Thomas Jerome Newton===\n[[File:Sebastian Roch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]] played Thomas Jerome Newton]]\n'''Thomas Jerome Newton''' (portrayed by [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]) is a leader among the shapeshifters and the main antagonist of Season 2.\n\nWhen Olivia is transported to the parallel universe, she meets William Bell, who warns her that the shapeshifters active in her universe are looking for Newton, since his resurrection will make it possible for the shapeshifters to re-open the gateway between their universes. Olivia is returned to her universe, but does not remember the details of her meeting with Bell in time to stop the shapeshifters from [[Momentum Deferred|succeeding in recovering Newton's cryogenically frozen head, and revive Newton]].\n\nHeaded by Newton, the shapeshifters start tracking down and extracting pieces of brain tissue from three separate mental patients. Knowing that the three pieces were once taken from Walter's brain and when reinserted, they will cause Walter to remember how to open the gateway between the universes. Newton is then able to complete his first mission; He synchronizes the brain tissues, kidnaps Walter, reinserts them into Walter's brain, and then interrogates the scientist, gathering the information he needs.\n\nNewton later re-surfaces, experimenting in opening portals to the parallel universe. Eventually he is able to successfully bring the shapeshifters' superior\u2014simply referred to as \"Mr. Secretary\"\u2014over to our universe. When Peter goes AWOL from Fringe Division upon learning of his real origin, he finds himself tracked by Newton and other shapeshifters. As Newton is finally able to corner Peter in his hotel room, he introduces him to his superior: the parallel universe [[United States Secretary of Defense]], and likewise Peter's real father, the alternate Walter Bishop.\n\nAs alternate Walter successfully replaces Olivia with her parallel universe version, tension between Newton and Fauxlivia rises. When US Senator Van Horn is severely injured and revealed to be a shapeshifter, Newton orders him killed. In \"[[Do Shapeshifters Dream of Electric Sheep?]]\" Newton is finally caught by the FBI, but, by means of the alternate Olivia, he commits suicide before the Fringe division is able to get any information from him.<ref name=electricsheep/>\n\nThomas Jerome Newton is the name of [[David Bowie]]'s character in ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''; Bowie's own birth name was David Robert Jones.\n\n===Sam Weiss===\n[[File:Kevin Corrigan 2017.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Kevin Corrigan]] played Sam Weiss]]\n{{anchord|'''Samuel \"Sam\" Weiss'''}} (portrayed by [[Kevin Corrigan]]) is a friend of Nina Sharp who operates at a bowling alley, and helped her with her physical therapy process after she lost her arm. After Olivia's first visit to the parallel universe, he helps Olivia regain her ability to walk, partially through showing her how to bowl. He begins to establish a friendship with her, and Olivia pays him another visit after learning the truth about Peter's origin. It is later discovered that Sam Weiss and his antecedents seem to possess knowledge about the First People and the operation of the doomsday machine.  The author of the English language First People book is shown to have been one \"Seamus Wiles\", published in the 1800s.\n\nHe also has other branches of mysterious knowledge, such as being able to predict that a series of seemingly random letters Olivia picks out will contain a message that would help her get over the death of Charlie. In the episode \"[[The Last Sam Weiss]]\", Sam explains that the name \"Sam Weiss\" has been handed down from several of his previous ancestors, the earliest having had found the bulk of the evidence on the First People, and that his line has been searching for more ever since.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Last Sam Weiss|episodelink=The Last Sam Weiss|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Thomas Yatsko]] (director), [[Monica Owusu-Breen]] (writer), [[Alison Schapker]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate= 2011-04-29|season=3 |number=21}}</ref> He is not mentioned after the episode \"The Last Sam Weiss\" until the ninth episode of the final season, when Olivia and Peter discover his body in a van, deducing that in this timeline, he died after the invasion protecting a signal tower, killing two observers and a loyalist in the process.\n\n===Elizabeth Bishop===\n'''Elizabeth Bishop''' (portrayed by [[Orla Brady]]) is Walter's wife in both universes. After Walter took the alternate Peter from the other universe, Elizabeth stayed at home with him, trying to convince Peter that she was his real mother. After running away from home, Peter finally comes to accept this Elizabeth as his mother, which later led to her suicide in 2001.\n\nThe alternate version of Elizabeth is alive and well, and still married to Walternate. When Peter returns to his home universe in \"[[Over There (Fringe)|Over There]]\", she is amazed to see him and bonds with him.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of [[Fringe (season 4)|season four]] Peter ventures to her home in an attempt to have her convince Secretary Bishop to help him return to his timeline. She recognizes him for who he is, and agrees to take him to Secretary Bishop. In the following episode, she uses the Bridge to visit Walter in his Harvard lab. They have a lengthy conversation in which she forgives him for taking her son, and that Peter is not a punishment or a curse on him, as Walter had believed.\n\n===\"Michael\" / Anomaly XB-6783746===\n\"'''Michael'''\" is a child Observer (portrayed by [[Spencer List]]<ref name=innerchild/> and later by Rowan Longworth), first introduced in the first season episode \"[[Inner Child (Fringe)|Inner Child]]\" and later re-introduced in the fifth season. The name \"Michael\" is given to him by adoptive parents who protect him in the 2036 future, as shown in the episode \"[[Black Blotter]]\",<ref name=blackblotter/> while later Captain Windmark cites him as '''Anomaly XB-6783746''' in the [[Anomaly XB-6783746|episode of the same name]].<ref name=anomaly/>\n\nMichael, like other Observers, is pale and bald; however, he does not possess the implant used by other Observers to further boost their intelligence while suppressing their emotions (and allowing them to time-shift). He is mute, but is able to communicate via writing, symbolic gestures, or by touching others and implanting thoughts into them. He has an empathic connection with others, particularly Olivia, and in \"Inner Child,\" is able to help her stop a serial murderer. At the end of that episode, he is taken into adoptive care; as he is driven off, he sees September watch the vehicle drive away.<ref name=innerchild/>\n\nIn the fifth and final season, Michael is revealed to be part of the plan by Walter and September to stop the Observers. Sometime after the Purge by the Observers, Walter hides Michael in a pocket dimension with the help of September (now stripped of his powers and known as Donald) (\"[[Through the Looking Glass and What Walter Found There]]\"). After Walter and the rest of Fringe Amber themselves, Donald returns to the pocket universe to extract Michael, then sheltering him with former Resistance fighters who escape detection by isolating themselves on a remote island. In 2036, Fringe is able to track Michael down, after discovering that he's missing from the pocket universe.\n\nMichael is revealed to be September's progeny, created from September's genetic material sometime in the early 27th century.  September purposely stopped the growth process, leaving Michael a child possessing both a powerful Observer-intellects and human emotion, creating an anomaly in danger of being destroyed by the Observers. September takes Michael to the past to hide him from the Observers. Much of September's machinations with Fringe in the first four seasons were to prepare Walter to use Michael for their plan to defeat the unemotional Observers (\"[[The Boy Must Live]]\"). In 2036, September, who has been made human by the Observers and has given himself the name of Donald O'Connor (after the actor in the movie \"[[Singin' In The Rain]]\") reveals his plan to take Michael to 2167, the year that human genetic experiments replacing all emotion with pure logic, will be performed. These experiments will ultimately lead to the creation of the Observers. Donald's plan is to convince the scientists of 2167 not to proceed with these experiments, by showing them that it is possible for humans to contain both logic and emotion and be peaceful, like Michael.\n\n==Minor characters== \n* {{anchor|August}} '''August''' (portrayed by [[Peter Woodward]]) is an Observer.

December appears to be the de facto leader of the 12 Observers. As September becomes more and more involved in helping and assisting Walter, Peter, Olivia, and Astrid, December strongly voices his opinions against it. In 2036, September (now called Donald O'Connor) goes to Apartment #513 to meet December. September asks December to help him find a final piece of a machine to reset time so that Observers never invade. December travels to 2609 to retrieve the piece.

He was institutionalized after a lab accident which resulted in manslaughter charges. Having been locked up for 17 years in a mental institute prior to becoming assigned to the Fringe division, Walter often expresses wonder at modern technology, and seems to be disconnected from the world, sometimes leaving his son to decode his rantings for others. He often says things which seem so obvious that no one else wants to say (or thinks necessary) and tends to burst into song while working, as he believes it helps him think. He is also known to eat or drink while working on a body, no matter how disgusting everyone else thinks it is. He seems to derive joy from both these quirks. He is the archetypal [[mad scientist]].\n\nThe Other Universe version of Walter Bishop, nicknamed {{anchord|Walternate}}, is the [[United States Secretary of Defense]], and directly oversees the alternate and more powerful Fringe division. He is the main antagonist of the third season. Walternate also serves as the immediate superior to the shapeshifters, with their leader\u2014Thomas Jerome Newton\u2014being extremely loyal and protective of him (possibly being friends).

The showdown between the two Fringe divisions leaves Lee with third degree burns covering 90% of his body. Thanks to the advanced nanotechnology known in the other dimension, Lee does not stay away from duty for long, and after a three months medical treatment he is completely recovered.\n\nLee is a capable agent and a devoted friend to his fellow Fringe division agents, risking his health by prematurely leaving his nano-regeneration chamber to help them. Lee seems to care deeply for Fauxlivia and even attempted kissing her before learning she had a boyfriend. He seems to be very bad at keeping secrets, as he immediately tells Fauxlivia that her fianc\u00e9 intends to propose to her after having been told in confidence. He is in charge of the Fringe division after the death of the alternate Colonel Broyles. At first he seems to doubt himself, saying that he \"feels like he's missing something, that Broyles would see something he wouldn't\" (\"[[Immortality (Fringe)|Immortality]]\") but he gains more confidence after apprehending the culprit.<ref name=immortality/>\n\nThe alternate timeline Lincoln Lee of the prime universe is an FBI Special Agent, and is distinguished by his use of eyeglasses and generally more clean cut appearance than his parallel universe counterpart. In the episode \"[[Everything in Its Right Place (Fringe)|Everything in Its Right Place]]\", the prime and parallel versions of Lincoln Lee both grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey until their moms died and then their dads moved them to Philadelphia, both fathers started an Ace Hardware, they both attended Hamilton High School, both had Mr. Glasberg as their 10th grade science teacher, they both graduated with a 3.85 GPA and both slacked off in their senior years to work at their dads' stores, and they both didn't go to prom because they both had just broken up with Alicia Dvoskin. Despite identical life experiences, at some point their lives bifurcated in opposite directions with the prime Lincoln Lee lacking confidence and the parallel Lincoln Lee being quite confident.  The parallel Lincoln Lee theorized that it was because he made a conscious choice to become that confident man. He's from Hartford, Connecticut.<ref name=stowaway/> Agent Broyles originally introduces him to the Fringe Division in order to consult on the case of a seemingly immortal woman, to which he had been assigned after her family was gruesomely murdered. He is at first confused by the bizarre antics of the agents and the seemingly impossible situations they investigate, but he seems to quickly take it in stride, becoming enthusiastic about the work and offering them his help whenever they need it.<ref name=stowaway/> This version of Agent Lee has also developed some romantic feelings towards Olivia, but does not fully act upon them due to the complications caused by the return of Peter. His alternate universe counterpart is killed in a shootout during Season 4, and prime universe Agent Lee stays in the alternate universe both to investigate David Robert Jones and because he feels less of a third wheel than with prime Olivia and Peter. Later, in Season 5, Agent Lee is shown to be married to Fauxlivia as they run Fringe division in the Other Universe.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Liberty |episodelink=Liberty (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[P.

During an investigation of a flesh-dissolving toxin, John is exposed to the toxin after the lab producing it explodes with him nearby. He is placed in a medically induced coma, and during this time [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] devises a procedure to link his mind to Olivia's in order to gain information about the suspect who caused the explosion. With that information, they locate the suspect, from whom they gain the necessary understanding of the chemical to cure John. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that John himself financed the creation of the toxin. This connection ties him to \"the Pattern\", the incidents investigated by the Fringe Division, making him a suspected terrorist. A subsequent high-speed chase results in John's death, leaving Olivia to question not only John's true loyalty, but also his love for her.<ref name=pilotepisode/>\n\nFollowing his death, John's corpse is secretly delivered to Massive Dynamic, to serve as an information gathering source.<ref name=pilotepisode/>\n\nAs a result of their mental link, part of John's consciousness is transferred to Olivia, allowing her to communicate with him through hallucinations and dreams. Her mind begins integrating and purging his consciousness, resulting in her mistaking his memories for her own. He also continually tells her that he loves her \"always\", and intends to prove it to her. While following his \"ghost\" she discovers a hideout of his where he seemed to be conducting an independent investigation into the \"pattern\". She also finds an engagement ring with the word \"always\" written inside, suggesting John was intending to propose to her, which she takes as a personal keepsake.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Power Hungry |episodelink=Power Hungry (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Christopher Misiano]] (director), [[Julia Cho]] (writer), [[Jason Cahill]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2008-10-14 |season=1 |number=5}}</ref>\n\nBefore his consciousness disappears completely, Olivia learns that John was working undercover for the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], infiltrating ZFT, by now known to be the organization responsible behind \"the Pattern\", and that whatever relationship the two of them had was real.

He is still the partner of Olivia and still affected by the toxin. However, while Olivia is able to get Walter out his mental hospital to help him, John dies before a cure can be found. His death profoundly affects Olivia, leaving her even more isolated and cold than in the previous timeline. It is also suggested that the toxin which killed him may have been a disastrous attempt by ZFT to create human shape-shifters, although this is unconfirmed.\n\n===Henrietta \"Etta\" Bishop===\n[[File:Georgina Haig (8367443534).jpg|160px|thumb|[[Georgina Haig]] plays Etta Bishop]]\n'''Henrietta \"Etta\" Bishop''' (portrayed by [[Georgina Haig]]) is a government agent in the year 2036, and is the daughter of Peter Bishop and Olivia Dunham.\n\nBishop first appeared in the [[Fringe (season 4)|fourth season]] installment \"[[Letters of Transit]]\".

The conviction was later overturned, but Harris' career was ruined. Harris then joined the Department of Homeland Security, rising in rank to become a high-level consultant for the Pentagon. He is called in to audit the procedures of the Fringe Division, and puts a clear emphasis on Olivia's actions. As his position makes him her superior officer, Olivia does her best to humor him.<ref name=episodebound/> Harris is eventually exposed as a ZFT operative during an investigation of two [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] women.

William is mentioned throughout season one, showing several ties with Walter's past and the study of the parallel world, including participating in the Cortexiphan trials. Sometime after Walter brought Peter from the parallel universe, William convinced Walter to allow him to remove pieces of Walter's brain and implant them in other patients to keep the knowledge of dimensional travel safe; this process led to Walter's mental instability and institutionalization. The two parted ways, William going on to form Massive Dynamic.\n\nSometime after founding Massive Dynamic, William finds a means to travel to the parallel dimension, and sets up an office in the still-standing [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. Though he travels back and forth several times, William finds his body has become unstable and remains in the parallel world, still communicating with Nina whom he left in charge of Massive Dynamic.\n\nDuring the first season, Walter discovers that William wrote the ZFT manifesto, which is the base for the ZFT members' actions (to prepare for war against the parallel world, by doing experiments of all sorts of weapons - chemical, biological, or even human).\n\nIn his first screen appearance, William brings Olivia across in the season 1 finale to warn her about the oncoming storm between universes and the identity of the shapeshifter Newton. In the second season finale, he helps Walter and Olivia to evade capture in the parallel universe, and then assists Walter in preparing equipment for them to return to the prime universe; William and Walter reestablish their friendship when William reminds Walter why he had removed the brain pieces. When Olivia returns with Peter, Bell is unable to cross over again, as his atoms would split apart and no trace of him would remain in either universe. Because of this, he sacrifices himself to provide the means for Walter, Peter, and Olivia (in actuality, the alternate Olivia) to return to the prime universe. With William now dead in both universes, Walter discovers at the start of Season 3 that William left the whole of Massive Dynamic to him in his will.\n\nAs explained by William at the end of Season 2, the alternate version of William was killed as a young man in a car accident;<ref name=overtherepart2/> as a result, Massive Dynamic in the parallel world was never formed, instead there is only Bishop Dynamic.\n\nIn season three, Walter remembers that William had an idea of developing \"soul magnets\", devices that would channel the energy from a dead body into another entity. Walter figures that William must have created a soul magnet for himself and figures that the trigger is the frequency created by the bell William left for Nina. Walter rings it and William's consciousness appears in Olivia.<ref name=osepisode/> \"Bellivia\" explains that he put the soul magnets in Olivia's tea when they first met in the other universe. Broyles gives William 48 hours to find a new viable host for him and get out of Olivia's body, but William takes his time as he knows that no harm is coming to Olivia. However, not too long after, Olivia regains control of her body briefly, confused and in a trance before William takes back over.

After Walter and Peter \"die\" within her mind, William aids Olivia in escaping until she is able to confront her own fears, enabling her to take back control of her body. William tells Olivia to pass on the message \"I knew the dog wouldn't hunt\" to Walter. He then departs from Olivia's consciousness. As Olivia wakes up, Astrid and Walter realise that William's plan to transfer his own consciousness into a computer has failed. Olivia relays William's message to Walter, who explains that the message was a phrase William would use in earlier experiments when he knew that they would not be successful, and that his reason for suggesting it was because \"William hates goodbyes\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lysergic Acid Diethylamide |episodelink=Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (Fringe) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[J.

Disbelieving Nina, Walter returns to St. Claire's Mental Institution and finds the scent of Bell among one of the log books that dated back to when Walter believed he had visited, and continues to assert this claim. After sending David Robert Jones to his demise, he kidnaps Walter, who has deduced that he is alive, and takes him onto his container ship to sail to his new universe. After Peter and Olivia rescue Walter, Bell rings his ship's bell and disappears. Broyles later notes that he was never found.\n\nWilliam returns in the future, trapped in amber with the Fringe team in 2036. Walter cuts off his hand and tells Astrid to not tell anyone, until in [[Five-Twenty-Ten]], he used it to unlock a storage facility and retrieve part of the plan.\n\n===Brandon Fayette===\n[[File:Ryan Mcdonald.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Ryan McDonald (actor)|Ryan McDonald]] plays Brandon Fayette]]\n'''Brandon Fayette''' (portrayed by [[Ryan McDonald (actor)|Ryan McDonald]]) is the leading scientist at Massive Dynamic, offering assistance to the Fringe team on multiple occasions.\n\nThe Other Universe version of Brandon is the chief scientist of the Fringe division, often answering directly to Secretary Bishop, and responsible for the assimilation of Olivia into Fauxlivia.

He is first shown whilst being contacted by [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]], who is trying to find the antidote for a parasite in Agent Loeb's body. Jones agrees to help her, but only in exchange for the opportunity to ask an associate one question. The response is a coded message picked up by Loeb, who is secretly working for Jones.<ref name=mrjonesepisode/>\n\nReceiving Jones' message, Loeb is soon able to proceed in creating a teleportation device once designed by [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]], and successfully teleports Jones out of prison, freeing him.\n\nIn \"[[Ability (Fringe)|Ability]]\" Jones turns himself over to the FBI, in exchange for Walter's help with the life-threatening side-effects of his teleportation. He then presents Olivia with a test: to prevent a biological bomb from detonating by turning off a series of lights only using her mind. Eventually, Olivia is able to do this, thanks to Walter's and Bell's Cortexiphan experiments conducted on her when she was a child. Jones then disappears again, leaving only a cryptic message: \"You Passed\".<ref name=abilityepisode/>\n\nIn the Season 1 finale, Jones' former relationship to William Bell is revealed, as is his goal of trying to escape to the parallel universe to confront Bell, who Jones believes never saw his true potential. Everything done by Jones since his introduction in the series has been either to get in contact with Bell, or to prove himself worthy of Bell's approval.<ref name=s1finaleepisode/>\n\nHe finally succeeds in opening a portal to the parallel universe, where Bell is located. However, the portal is dangerously unstable, threatening to cause severe harm to both universes. Peter is able to close the portal in time for it not to result in any real disaster. Jones, being only halfway through the portal, is cut in half and dies immediately.<ref name=s1finaleepisode/>\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"[[Back to Where You've Never Been]]\", David Robert Jones returns as a character in the alternate timeline created by Peter Bishop's deletion at the end of Season 3.

Like other Observers that have appeared on the show, September is only seen [[men in Black|wearing a plain black suit and black fedora]], and is pale, bald, and lacks eyebrows. They exhibit several strange mannerisms such as awkward phrasing when talking, a preference for extremely flavored, like spicy or salty foods due to an extremely dulled sense of taste, and the ability to appear or disappear when one looks away. They also use an alien written language with which they maintain copious documentation in small notebooks. Though the Fringe division is aware of the Observers, their intent is not yet known, though believed to be related to the Machine and the conflict between the two universes. They possess uniquely advanced technology, and appear to be temporally aware of time, including the ability to travel in time and between the two universes; the Fringe division finds evidence of Observers at several historical events but looking the same as they do in the present. Like September, the other Observers appear to be named after months, including \"August\" and \"December\". The episode \"[[Inner Child (Fringe)|Inner Child]]\" introduces the Fringe division to a child that appears to possess many Observer-like qualities.<ref name=innerchild>{{cite episode |title=Inner Child |episodelink=Inner Child (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Fred Toye]] (director), [[Julia Cho]] (writer), [[Brad Caleb Kane]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate= 2009-04-07 |season=1 |number=15}}</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Peter (Fringe episode)|Peter]]\", September is a catalyst in Walter's abduction of Peter from the parallel universe; September arrived wanting to see the creation of the cure by Walternate that would have saved Peter, but instead distracted Walternate from witnessing a critical test result. When September saw Walter watching through the window-like device, he informed his fellow Observers that he could correct the situation; later, after Walter returned with young Peter to the prime universe and fell through the frozen lake's ice, September rescued them from the freezing water and told Walter, \"The child must live\".\n\nSeptember and the other Observers have since monitored Walter and Peter. In the second season's finale, September is responsible for alerting the Fringe division to the dangers of Peter being taken back by Walternate to the parallel universe, ultimately leading to their rescue attempt. In the third season episode \"[[The Firefly (Fringe)|The Firefly]]\", September conducts a convoluted experiment to test Walter's resolve to give up Peter for the greater good when the time comes.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Firefly|episodelink=The Firefly (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]] (director), [[J.H.

However, at the last moment, he disobeys his orders and deactivates the device, allowing brief apparitions of Peter to appear to Walter and Olivia.\n\nIn \"[[Novation (Fringe)|Novation]]\" Peter mysteriously appears in the new timeline. After being taken into custody by the Fringe Division, he learns that the point of divergence in the timeline is that September never saved him from drowning in Reiden Lake when Walter brought him over from the alternate universe. He also learns that, in the new timeline, the Fringe Division is unaware of the existence of the Observers.\n\nSeptember later [[Back to Where You've Never Been|appears]] to Olivia while she waits for Peter and Lincoln to return from the alternate universe. Mysteriously wounded from a gunshot to the chest, he warns Olivia that he has seen all of the possible timelines, and the result is always the same: Olivia has to die. He then disappears before Olivia can call an ambulance to help him.<ref name=backtowhere/>\n\nHe resurfaces several episodes later in \"[[The End of All Things]]\", during Peter and Walter's search for the kidnapped Olivia, where he appears in Walter's lab, and is dying from the gunshot wound. In an attempt to discover the location of Olivia, Peter enters September's mind using the same method Olivia used to enter John's in the pilot. September has no information on Olivia, but does tell Peter that the Observers come from the future to observe their beginnings, and explains that he has interfered in the past. It is explained that this was an attempt to correct the timeline after accidentally preventing Walternate from discovering the cure to save Peter, thus beginning a chain of events that led to the war between the two universes. He also cryptically says, \"they are coming\". Before Peter can ask who, September tells Peter to \"go home\" and yanks him out of his mind. In the real world, September disappears from the lab, having been taken by the others.\n\nIn the next episode it is revealed that he planted a message in the form of a black dot in Peter's eye which contains an address in New York. Peter goes to the address to discover Observer technology in an apartment and a cylinder like the one in \"[[The Arrival (Fringe)|The Arrival]]\" which teleports a fully healed September to the apartment. Peter begs September to send him back to the original timeline but September assures him that this is where he is meant to be before teleporting away.\n\nIn the [[Fringe (season 5)|5th season]] episodes \"[[Anomaly XB-6783746]]\" and \"[[The Boy Must Live]]\", it is revealed that after the events of the fourth season, the Observers removed September's observer technology and conducted \"biological reversion\" experiments on him, causing him to transform into a human. As a human, he assumed the name '''Donald O'Connor'''.<ref name=anomaly/>\n\nAn Observer (either September or a different unnamed Observer) appeared in every episode of ''Fringe'', albeit sometimes only as a brief cameo.<ref name=\"sightings\">[http://fringe-theobserver.blogspot.com/ The Observer Sightings]</ref> As a tie-in with the show, actors playing Observers appeared in the audience of other FOX network shows, including ''[[American Idol]]'' and the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/04/08/fringe-american/ | title = 'Fringe' invades 'American Idol'... or was it the other way around? | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate = 2009-04-08 | first=Ken| last=Tucker| date = 2011-04-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002474.html | title = Fringe element haunts Fox shows | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-04-30 | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date = 2009-04-15 }}</ref>\n\nIn creating the Observers, the producers had some idea of how they would be introduced into the show, starting as a background character and only becoming a significant figure by the midpoint of the first season.<ref name=\"fearnet observers\"/> Though they had some idea of the Observers' role, they gave Cerveris much leeway to develop the character in the manner he wanted, from choosing the outfit he would wear to his language mannerisms.<ref name=\"fearnet observers\">{{cite web | url  =http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b22326_exclusive_michael_cerveris_observes.html | title = Exclusive: Michael Cerveris Observes the 'Fringe' Season 3 Finale! | first = Joseph | last = McCabe | date = 2011-04-11 | accessdate = 2011-07-03 | publisher = [[Fear.net]] }}</ref> Cerveris further is credited with creating the written Observer language during his scenes in \"The Arrival\", which the production team later extrapolated into a complete language for the show.<ref name=\"fringe props\">{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3nNq55_y6M | title = FRINGE - Show and Tell  | publisher = [[Fox Entertainment]] | date =2011-06-30 | accessdate= 2011-06-30 | medium = Television production | format = [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] | people = Robert K.

They are able to take the form of any person by using a device that plugs into the roof of their mouth and the mouth of the target. This process occurs after the shapeshifter has killed the target prior to the transformation; without the device, the shapeshifter is locked in its current form. Shapeshifters also may be programmed as sleeper agents, unaware of their unusual nature until they are activated. The primary characteristic differentiates a human and a shapeshifter is the large quantity of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in their blood, and the presence of a metallic data disc at the base of their spine. William Bell believes the shapeshifters were designed this way to withstand travel between the universes.\n\nThe first shapeshifter witnessed by the Fringe division is one that follows Olivia after her meeting with William from the parallel world in the second season premiere, \"[[A New Day in the Old Town]]\". He eventually kills Charlie and takes his place,<ref name=newdayoldtown/> using his position to find the location of Newton before he is identified by Olivia and killed.<ref name=momentumdeferred/> Several other shapeshifters have been shown in the series, including one that aids in the parallel universe's Olivia's escape from the prime universe.\n\nPeter Bishop later takes it upon himself to kill all of the remaining shapeshifters in the Prime Universe, after he is able to decode their sleeper identities from the files on Fauxlivia's computer. He successfully kills all of the ones identified, but it remains to be seen if he eliminated all of them.<ref name=reciprocity/>\n\n===Thomas Jerome Newton===\n[[File:Sebastian Roch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]] played Thomas Jerome Newton]]\n'''Thomas Jerome Newton''' (portrayed by [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]]) is a leader among the shapeshifters and the main antagonist of Season 2.\n\nWhen Olivia is transported to the parallel universe, she meets William Bell, who warns her that the shapeshifters active in her universe are looking for Newton, since his resurrection will make it possible for the shapeshifters to re-open the gateway between their universes. Olivia is returned to her universe, but does not remember the details of her meeting with Bell in time to stop the shapeshifters from [[Momentum Deferred|succeeding in recovering Newton's cryogenically frozen head, and revive Newton]].\n\nHeaded by Newton, the shapeshifters start tracking down and extracting pieces of brain tissue from three separate mental patients. Knowing that the three pieces were once taken from Walter's brain and when reinserted, they will cause Walter to remember how to open the gateway between the universes. Newton is then able to complete his first mission; He synchronizes the brain tissues, kidnaps Walter, reinserts them into Walter's brain, and then interrogates the scientist, gathering the information he needs.\n\nNewton later re-surfaces, experimenting in opening portals to the parallel universe. Eventually he is able to successfully bring the shapeshifters' superior\u2014simply referred to as \"Mr. Secretary\"\u2014over to our universe. When Peter goes AWOL from Fringe Division upon learning of his real origin, he finds himself tracked by Newton and other shapeshifters. As Newton is finally able to corner Peter in his hotel room, he introduces him to his superior: the parallel universe [[United States Secretary of Defense]], and likewise Peter's real father, the alternate Walter Bishop.\n\nAs alternate Walter successfully replaces Olivia with her parallel universe version, tension between Newton and Fauxlivia rises. When US Senator Van Horn is severely injured and revealed to be a shapeshifter, Newton orders him killed. In \"[[Do Shapeshifters Dream of Electric Sheep?]]\" Newton is finally caught by the FBI, but, by means of the alternate Olivia, he commits suicide before the Fringe division is able to get any information from him.<ref name=electricsheep/>\n\nThomas Jerome Newton is the name of [[David Bowie]]'s character in ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]''; Bowie's own birth name was David Robert Jones.\n\n===Sam Weiss===\n[[File:Kevin Corrigan 2017.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Kevin Corrigan]] played Sam Weiss]]\n{{anchord|'''Sam Weiss'''}} (portrayed by [[Kevin Corrigan]]) is a friend of Nina Sharp who operates at a bowling alley, and helped her with her physical therapy process after she lost her arm. After Olivia's first visit to the parallel universe, he helps Olivia regain her ability to walk, partially through showing her how to bowl. He begins to establish a friendship with her, and Olivia pays him another visit after learning the truth about Peter's origin. It is later discovered that Sam Weiss and his antecedents seem to possess knowledge about the First People and the operation of the doomsday machine.  The author of the English language First People book is shown to have been one \"Seamus Wiles\", published in the 1800s.\n\nHe also has other branches of mysterious knowledge, such as being able to predict that a series of seemingly random letters Olivia picks out will contain a message that would help her get over the death of Charlie. In the episode \"[[The Last Sam Weiss]]\", Sam explains that the name \"Sam Weiss\" has been handed down from several of his previous ancestors, the earliest having had found the bulk of the evidence on the First People, and that his line has been searching for more ever since.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Last Sam Weiss|episodelink=The Last Sam Weiss|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Thomas Yatsko]] (director), [[Monica Owusu-Breen]] (writer), [[Alison Schapker]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate= 2011-04-29|season=3 |number=21}}</ref> He is not mentioned after the episode \"The Last Sam Weiss\" until the ninth episode of the final season, when Olivia and Peter discover his body in a van, deducing that in this timeline, he died after the invasion protecting a signal tower, killing two observers and a loyalist in the process.\n\n===Elizabeth Bishop===\n'''Elizabeth Bishop''' (portrayed by [[Orla Brady]]) is Walter's wife in both universes. After Walter took the alternate Peter from the other universe, Elizabeth stayed at home with him, trying to convince Peter that she was his real mother. After running away from home, Peter finally comes to accept this Elizabeth as his mother, which later led to her suicide in 2001.\n\nThe alternate version of Elizabeth is alive and well, and still married to Walternate. When Peter returns to his home universe in \"[[Over There (Fringe)|Over There]]\", she is amazed to see him and bonds with him.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of [[Fringe (season 4)|season four]] Peter ventures to her home in an attempt to have her convince Secretary Bishop to help him return to his timeline. She recognizes him for who he is, and agrees to take him to Secretary Bishop. In the following episode, she uses the Bridge to visit Walter in his Harvard lab. They have a lengthy conversation in which she forgives him for taking her son, and that Peter is not a punishment or a curse on him, as Walter had believed.\n\n===\"Michael\" / Anomaly XB-6783746===\n\"'''Michael'''\" is a child Observer (portrayed by [[Spencer List]]<ref name=innerchild/> and later by Rowan Longworth), first introduced in the first season episode \"[[Inner Child (Fringe)|Inner Child]]\" and later re-introduced in the fifth season. The name \"Michael\" is given to him by adoptive parents who protect him in the 2036 future, as shown in the episode \"[[Black Blotter]]\",<ref name=blackblotter/> while later Captain Windmark cites him as '''Anomaly XB-6783746''' in the [[Anomaly XB-6783746|episode of the same name]].<ref name=anomaly/>\n\nMichael, like other Observers, is pale and bald; however, he does not possess the implant used by other Observers to further boost their intelligence while suppressing their emotions (and allowing them to time-shift). He is mute, but is able to communicate via writing, symbolic gestures, or by touching others and implanting thoughts into them. He has an empathic connection with others, particularly Olivia, and in \"Inner Child,\" is able to help her stop a serial murderer. At the end of that episode, he is taken into adoptive care; as he is driven off, he sees September watch the vehicle drive away.<ref name=innerchild/>\n\nIn the fifth and final season, Michael is revealed to be part of the plan by Walter and September to stop the Observers. Sometime after the Purge by the Observers, Walter hides Michael in a pocket dimension with the help of September (now stripped of his powers and known as Donald) (\"[[Through the Looking Glass and What Walter Found There]]\"). After Walter and the rest of Fringe Amber themselves, Donald returns to the pocket universe to extract Michael, then sheltering him with former Resistance fighters who escape detection by isolating themselves on a remote island. In 2036, Fringe is able to track Michael down, after discovering that he's missing from the pocket universe.\n\nMichael is revealed to be September's progeny, created from September's genetic material sometime in the early 27th century.  September purposely stopped the growth process, leaving Michael a child possessing both a powerful Observer-intellects and human emotion, creating an anomaly in danger of being destroyed by the Observers. September takes Michael to the past to hide him from the Observers. Much of September's machinations with Fringe in the first four seasons were to prepare Walter to use Michael for their plan to defeat the unemotional Observers (\"[[The Boy Must Live]]\"). In 2036, September, who has been made human by the Observers and has given himself the name of Donald O'Connor (after the actor in the movie \"[[Singin' In The Rain]]\") reveals his plan to take Michael to 2167, the year that human genetic experiments replacing all emotion with pure logic, will be performed. These experiments will ultimately lead to the creation of the Observers. Donald's plan is to convince the scientists of 2167 not to proceed with these experiments, by showing them that it is possible for humans to contain both logic and emotion and be peaceful, like Michael.\n\n==Minor characters== \n* {{anchor|August}} '''August''' (portrayed by [[Peter Woodward]]) is an Observer.

December is one of the original 12 observers who came to the Fringe team's era to observe and report back to The Observers in the future. December appears to be the de facto leader of the 12 Observers. As September becomes more and more involved in helping and assisting Walter, Peter, Olivia, and Astrid, December strongly voices his opinions against it. In 2036, September (now called Donald O'Connor) goes to Apartment #513 to meet December. September asks December to help him find a final piece of a machine to reset time so that Observers never invade. December travels to 2609 to retrieve the piece.

Making it was a scary, empowering experience. Some of my proudest moments as a lyricist happened while writing 'PETALS FOR ARMOR.' And I was able to get my hands a little dirtier than usual when it came to instrumentation. I'm in a band with my favorite musicians so I never really feel the need to step into a role as a player when it comes to Paramore records. This project, however, benefited from a little bit of musical na\u00efvet\u00e9 and rawness and so I experimented quite a bit more. I made this with some of the closest people to me.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.
