At the time of release and in the years since, the film has garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]]. This is the final film to feature actor [[Matthew McGrory]] before his death the same year (although McGrory did have an uncredited posthumous cameo in 2017's ''[[The Evil Within (2017 film)|The Evil Within]]'', which was filmed in 2002). The film's DVD release is dedicated to his \"loving memory\".\n\n==Plot==\nSeven months later after the Halloween sacrifice, on May 18, 1978, [[Texas]] Sheriff John Quincey Wydell and a large posse of [[state troopers]] issue a [[search and destroy]] mission on the Firefly family for over 75 [[homicide]]s and disappearances over the past several years. The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car and, after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel.\n\nWhile at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, [[Captain Spaulding]], decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas, and he frightens a boy and assaults the boy's mother before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis rapes Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand.\n\nOtis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but Otis bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van.\n\nThe motel maid comes to clean the room, and she discovers the murder scene. The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees \"The Devil's Rejects\" written on the wall in blood; she is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help while she is in shock. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters\u2014the \"Unholy Two\"\u2014Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose his sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.\n\nAfter he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the \"Unholy Two\", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs; he then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.\n\nWydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but he lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but he is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, breaking Wydell's neck and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who [[Suicide|walks back into the burning house]]. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding and hands them each a gun. As [[Free Bird|a song playing on the radio declares they \"can't change\"]], they speed toward the barricade, guns blazing, as the police return fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Firefly (film series) characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding]] / \"Cutter\"\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis Driftwood\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Vera-Ellen \"Baby\" Firefly\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Sheriff John Quincey Wydell\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Charlie Altamont\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny Firefly\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Gloria Firefly\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Officer Ray Dobson\n* [[Elizabeth Daily|E.

Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters\u2014the \"Unholy Two\"\u2014Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys. While investigating, they discover an associate of Spaulding's named Charlie Altamont. Wydell begins to lose his sanity when Mother Firefly reveals that she murdered his brother. After having a dream in which his brother commands him to avenge his death, Wydell stabs Mother Firefly to death. The surviving Fireflys gather at a brothel owned by Charlie, where he offers them shelter from the police.\n\nAfter he leaves the brothel, Wydell threatens Charlie to give up the Fireflys. With the help of the \"Unholy Two\", the sheriff takes the family back to the Firefly house where he tortures them, using similar methods they used on their own victims. He nails Otis' hands to his chair and staples crime scene photographs to Otis's and Baby's stomachs; he then beats and shocks Captain Spaulding and Otis with a cattle prod and taunts Baby about the death of her mother.\n\nWydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to burn, but he lets Baby loose outside so he can hunt her for sport. Charlie returns to save the Firefly family, but he is killed by Wydell. Baby gets shot in the calf of her left leg, brutally horse-whipped, and then strangled by Wydell. Tiny suddenly arrives and intervenes, breaking Wydell's neck and saving the Firefly family. Otis, Baby, and Spaulding escape in Charlie's 1972 [[Cadillac Eldorado]], leaving behind Tiny, who [[Suicide|walks back into the burning house]]. The trio drives, badly injured and seemingly humbled by their experience with a clearer understanding of the torment and anguish that they had put their past victims through. As Otis drives down the road with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat he notices a police barricade ahead of them. Realizing that they will not make it out alive, he wakes Baby and Spaulding and hands them each a gun. As [[Free Bird|a song playing on the radio declares they \"can't change\"]], they speed toward the barricade, guns blazing, as the police return fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Firefly (film series) characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding]] / \"Cutter\"\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis Driftwood\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Vera-Ellen \"Baby\" Firefly\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Sheriff John Quincey Wydell\n* [[Ken Foree]] as Charlie Altamont\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny Firefly\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Gloria Firefly\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Officer Ray Dobson\n* [[Elizabeth Daily|E.

Howard]] about [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]. It was written in only a few days in spring of 1934 and first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in December 1934. A book edition was published in 1975 by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher]] with illustrations by [[Alicia Austin]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/witch-shall-be-born/oclc/2967501 ''A Witch Shall Be Born''] at [[Worldcat]]</ref>\n\nThe story concerns a witch replacing her twin sister as queen of a city state, which brings her into conflict with Conan who had been the captain of the queen's guard. Themes of paranoia, and the duality of the twin sisters, are paramount in this story but it also includes elements of the conflict between barbarism and civilization that is common to the entire Conan series. The novella as a whole is considered an average example of the series, but one scene stands out. Conan's crucifixion early on in the story during the second chapter (\"The Tree of Death\") is considered one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series. A variation of this scene was included in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.\n\nSalome has conspired with a [[voivode]] named Constantius, also known as \"The Falcon\", the Kothic leader for an army of Shemitish mercenaries, to take over the city of Khauran. Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort. The Khaurani army is disbanded and replaced by Constantius' Shemitish mercenaries, an event which turns violent when the captain of the queen's guard, Conan the Cimmerian, refuses to obey Salome's order.\n\nAfter putting his back against a wall while killing a number of Constantius' warriors, Conan is finally captured and crucified for his defiance. Olgerd [[Vladislav]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporoskan]] leader of a band of Zuagir desert raiders, is riding by with his scouting party and discovers a crucified Conan a mile outside the city walls. Vladislav doesn't entirely help Conan. He has the base of the cross cut, leaving it to fate and Conan's hardiness that he isn't crushed by the heavy wood. Vladislav then refuses to give Conan any water, claiming the Cimmerian must wait until after a ten-mile trek towards their outlaw camp to prove himself worthy of his band.\n\nIn Khauran, Salome's reign as \"Taramis\" has plunged the city into ruin. Citizens are killed, tortured, or sold as slaves; heavy taxes are imposed; and women are frequently [[wikt:debauch|debauched]] by the Shemites. Salome desecrates the temple of Ishtar in the center of her city and summons a demon, Thaug, to live inside it. Soon, the citizens of Khauran are routinely sacrificed to Thaug.\n\nConan has been expanding the numbers of Zuagirs as Vladislav's lieutenant, while also secretly establishing communication with the Khaurani Knights who had become refugees. When he has a sufficient force, Conan deposes Vladislav's leadership of the Zuagirs, but doesn't kill him in repayment for Vladislav having saved his life from the cross. Conan fakes the construction of siege engines with palm trees and painted silk. Soon, Constantius is fooled by this as his scouts cannot get close enough to see them properly and Conan is known for his experience in all manner of warfare. The Shemitish mercenaries ride out of their city for an open-field battle, with Constantius expecting only the lightly armed Zuagirs, but are taken by surprise by the Khaurani cavalry hidden amongst them. Conan's forces are victorious, ruthlessly taking no prisoners. The Zuagirs, Shemite nomads, are hereditary enemies of the Western Shemite city dwellers from whom Constantius' mercenaries were drawn, while the Khaurani exiles are full of bitterness over the Shemites' oppression of their city; neither are inclined to be merciful to their defeated enemies.\n\nMeanwhile, Valerius, a former member of the Khaurani army, has discovered the secret of Salome's masquerade, and the fact that Salome is holding the real Taramis within her dungeon. With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.\n\nSoon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"\n\nSalome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust\u2014even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 10.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Avon Fantasy Reader'' #10 (1949). The first reprinting of the story. Unknown artist.]]\n\nA theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nHoward may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.\n\nLouinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character\u2014literarily or literally\u2014who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nThe supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E.

Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, as well as the subsequent journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina. When Constantius is finally crucified, Conan states \"You are more fit to inflict torture than endure it. ...You civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as ours.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\n==Background==\nThis story was written in late May or early June 1934.<ref name=\"Louinet\">{{Citation |last = Louinet |first = Patrice |year = 2003 |title = The Bloody Crown of Conan |chapter = Hyborian Genesis Part II |publisher = Del Rey Books |isbn = 0-345-46152-5 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 358\u2013359] |chapter-url-access = registration |chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 }}</ref>  [[Farnsworth Wright]], editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was running out of Conan stories which were growing in popularity and attracting new readers to the magazine.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  Howard had recently finished the Conan novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', which was not intended for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and the story previous to that, \"[[The People of the Black Circle]]\" was already scheduled for August.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He finished \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" in only two drafts over a period of days in order to meet this deadline.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> Wright accepted it without hesitation, telling Howard it was his best Conan story to date, and made it the cover story for the December issue.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n==Reception==\nHoward scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story in only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\nOn the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".\n\n==Publication history==\nThe story was first published in the December 1934 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.<ref name=\"howardworks\">{{cite web |url=http://howardworks.com/storyw.htm#witc2 |title=A Witch Shall Be Born |work=HowardWorks |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>  The first reprint followed in 1949, when the story was published in the digest anthology ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' #10.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  The novella was the cover story and main feature of both publications.\n\nA version of the story that was edited and altered by [[L.

Howard]] about [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]. It was written in only a few days in spring of 1934 and first published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in December 1934. A book edition was published in 1975 by [[Donald M. Grant, Publisher]] with illustrations by [[Alicia Austin]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/witch-shall-be-born/oclc/2967501 ''A Witch Shall Be Born''] at [[Worldcat]]</ref>\n\nThe story concerns a witch replacing her twin sister as queen of a city state, which brings her into conflict with Conan who had been the captain of the queen's guard. Themes of paranoia, and the duality of the twin sisters, are paramount in this story but it also includes elements of the conflict between barbarism and civilization that is common to the entire Conan series. The novella as a whole is considered an average example of the series, but one scene stands out. Conan's crucifixion early on in the story during the second chapter (\"The Tree of Death\") is considered one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series. A variation of this scene was included in the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Queen Taramis]] of Khauran awakens one day to find her identical twin sister, Salome, staring at her in the face. As an infant, [[Salome]] was deemed a witch due to a crescent-shaped birthmark on her chest. This birthmark was believed to be a sign of evil, so she was left in the desert to die. However, a magician from Khitai (China) found Salome, brought her up, and instructed her in the art of sorcery.\n\nSalome has conspired with a [[voivode]] named Constantius, also known as \"The Falcon\", the Kothic leader for an army of Shemitish mercenaries, to take over the city of Khauran. Queen Taramis is sent to the palace dungeon, with the implications of torture and rape. Salome assumes Taramis' identity as the queen of Khauran and names Constantius as her royal consort. The Khaurani army is disbanded and replaced by Constantius' Shemitish mercenaries, an event which turns violent when the captain of the queen's guard, Conan the Cimmerian, refuses to obey Salome's order.\n\nAfter putting his back against a wall while killing a number of Constantius' warriors, Conan is finally captured and crucified for his defiance. Olgerd [[Vladislav]], the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporoskan]] leader of a band of Zuagir desert raiders, is riding by with his scouting party and discovers a crucified Conan a mile outside the city walls. Vladislav doesn't entirely help Conan. He has the base of the cross cut, leaving it to fate and Conan's hardiness that he isn't crushed by the heavy wood. Vladislav then refuses to give Conan any water, claiming the Cimmerian must wait until after a ten-mile trek towards their outlaw camp to prove himself worthy of his band.\n\nIn Khauran, Salome's reign as \"Taramis\" has plunged the city into ruin. Citizens are killed, tortured, or sold as slaves; heavy taxes are imposed; and women are frequently [[wikt:debauch|debauched]] by the Shemites. Salome desecrate the temple of Ishtar in the center of her city and summons a demon, Thaug, to live inside it. Soon, the citizens of Khauran are routinely sacrificed to Thaug.\n\nConan has been expanding the numbers of Zuagirs as Vladislav's lieutenant, while also secretly establishing communication with the Khaurani Knights who had become refugees. When he has a sufficient force, Conan deposes Vladislav's leadership of the Zuagirs, but doesn't kill him in repayment for Vladislav having saved his life from the cross. Conan fakes the construction of siege engines with palm trees and painted silk. Soon, Constantius is fooled by this as his scouts cannot get close enough to see them properly and Conan is known for his experience in all manner of warfare. The Shemitish mercenaries ride out of their city for an open-field battle, with Constantius expecting only the lightly armed Zuagirs, but are taken by surprise by the Khaurani cavalry hidden amongst them. Conan's forces are victorious, ruthlessly taking no prisoners. The Zuagirs, Semite nomads, are hereditary enemies of the Western Semite city dwellers from whom Constantius' mercenaries were drawn, while the Khaurani exiles are full of bitterness over the Semites' oppression of their city; neither are inclined to be merciful to their defeated enemies.\n\nMeanwhile, Valerius, a former member of the Khaurani army, has discovered the secret of Salome's masquerade, and the fact that Salome is holding the real Taramis within her dungeon. With Conan's forces approaching Khauran, Valerius plans to rescue Taramis and reveal the conspiracy to his people or to escape with the true queen. Conan's victory is not certain to the Khauranis and they are nervous about his intentions if he does take Khauran. When it becomes apparent that Conan has defeated Constantius' Shemites, Salome decides to kill Taramis before his army can reclaim the city. She thwarts Valerius' rescue attempt and sends Taramis to the former temple of Ishtar to sacrifice her to Thaug. Valerius saves Taramis and kills Salome, but not before she unleashes Thaug. Conan arrives with his Khaurani allies and some Zuagir warriors, who kill the demon with two flights of arrows.\n\nSoon, Taramis offers to make Conan her royal councillor and captain. However, he declines the queen's offer and nominates Valerius instead. Conan, as chief of the Zuagirs, drives away the remaining Shemites (capturing Constantius in the process) and leaves to raid the nearby kingdom of Turan. Before leaving Khauran, he crucifies Constantius at the site where he'd been crucified, commenting with irony to a crucified Constantius the difference between their respective situations: \"I hung there on a cross as you are hanging, and I lived, thanks to circumstances and a stamina peculiar to barbarians. But you civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as are ours. Your fortitude consists mainly in inflicting torment, not in enduring it. You will be dead before sundown. And so, Falcon, I leave you to the companionship of [[Vulture|another bird of the desert]].\"\n\nSalome's words at the beginning - \"'Every century a witch shall be born.' So ran the ancient curse. And so it has come to pass. Each was named Salome. I too am Salome. It was always Salome, the witch. It will always be Salome, the witch, even when the mountains of ice have roared down from the pole and ground the civilizations to ruin, and a new world has risen from the ashes and dust\u2014even then there shall be Salomes to walk the earth, to trap men's hearts by their sorcery, to dance before the kings of the world, and see the heads of the wise men fall at their pleasure\" - clearly imply that the witch Salome of this story is an earlier incarnation of the notorious [[Salome]] of the [[New Testament]], who instigated the beheading of [[John the Baptist]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Avon Fantasy Reader 10.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Avon Fantasy Reader'' #10 (1949). The first reprinting of the story. Unknown artist.]]\n\nA theme of paranoia runs through the story.  Howard uses a theme common to his works in having evil hide behind innocent features. Similarly, Vladislav is unaware of Conan's plans until it's too late. Of all the characters, only Conan is aware of all the facts.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The twin sisters, Taramis and Salome, are an instance of Howard's interest in siblings and the theme of duality, which appeared in several other works.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nHoward may have been experimenting with style in this novella, leaving behind any standard pulp formula. Conan dominates the story, but he is only actually present in two chapters.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> The narrative instead builds the plot by following others, such as Valerius, Salome, and a wandering savant named Astreas.\n\nLouinet suggests that Conan becomes figuratively immortal and superhuman following his crucifixion: \"How can anybody kill a character\u2014literarily or literally\u2014who can survive such a scene as that one?\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\nThe supernatural elements of the story are minor and may only have been included to justify publication in ''Weird Tales''.<ref name=\"Weinberg\">{{Citation |last = Weinberg |first = Robert |authorlink = Robert Weinberg |year = 1976 |title = The Annotated Guide to Robert E.

Conan is able to endure and survive his crucifixion, as well as the subsequent journey without water, thanks to his barbarian stamina. When Constantius is finally crucified, Conan states \"You are more fit to inflict torture than endure it. ...You civilized men are soft; your lives are not nailed to your spines as ours.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\n==Background==\nThis story was written in late May or early June 1934.<ref name=\"Louinet\">{{Citation |last = Louinet |first = Patrice |year = 2003 |title = The Bloody Crown of Conan |chapter = Hyborian Genesis Part II |publisher = Del Rey Books |isbn = 0-345-46152-5 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 358\u2013359] |chapter-url-access = registration |chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/bloodycrownofcon00howa/page/358 }}</ref>  [[Farnsworth Wright]], editor of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was running out of Conan stories which were growing in popularity and attracting new readers to the magazine.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  Howard had recently finished the Conan novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', which was not intended for publication in ''Weird Tales'' and the story previous to that, \"[[The People of the Black Circle]]\" was already scheduled for August.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He finished \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" in only two drafts over a period of days in order to meet this deadline.<ref name=\"Louinet\" /> Wright accepted it without hesitation, telling Howard it was his best Conan story to date, and made it the cover story for the December issue.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n==Reception==\nHoward scholar Patrice Louinet refers to this as a rather forgettable Conan story but one that contains the most memorable scene of the entire series: Conan's [[crucifixion]] at the hands of Constantius.<ref name=\"Louinet\" />  He goes on to say that, while of average quality, it \"exudes Howard's confidence in his creation.\"<ref name=\"Louinet\" />\n\n[[Robert Weinberg]] concurs, mentioning the \"best scene in the entire Conan series\" but comments that the remainder of the story in only average.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  Of the crucifixion, Weinberg writes, \"Only Howard could have given the scene life.\"<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  He states that this scene, the \"blood and passion\", is an indicator of why Howard is better than any of his imitators.  The violence is \"graphic and elemental\" while the torture \"barbaric, primitive and real\" not allowing the hero a chance to escape.  Instead, Conan survives by sheer endurance, even killing an overeager vulture with his teeth. The passion in the text and strength of the prose suspends disbelief in Conan's survival on the cross.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />  However, Weinberg criticizes the fact that much of the action takes place offstage, for instance, being related to the reader through a letter from the otherwise unseen Astreas or through a priest communicating with Salome.<ref name=\"Weinberg\" />\n\nOn the same subject, Rev. Austin Spencer noted <ref>Rev. Austin James Spencer, \"Christianity and Twentieth Century American Culture\", p. 45-47, Spiritual Guidance Press, Kansas City, 1983</ref> that: \"The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] has left a deep mark on all members of Western culture, regardless of whether or not one be a Christian believer. Robert E. Howard is certainly no exception. (...) When I was preparing the present volume, a colleague drew my attention to ''A Witch Shall be Born''. I was both impressed and appalled by Howard's achievement - creating a full-fledged Pagan counterpart and total antithesis to the New Testament account.(...) The crucified Conan does not feel forsaken by his god, Crom. This god, Crom, offers neither physical deliverance not spiritual solace -  he merely endows Cimmerians with enormous strength and tenacity to fight. Conan, killing a vulture with his teeth while pinioned to the cross, is a true votary of his savage god. There are no thieves crucified at Conan's side - the thieves remove him from the cross in exchange for his joining their thievery. (...) Conan does not forgive his enemies, and certainly does not ask Crom to do so; he takes direct and ruthless revenge. For Conan, the rule is simple and straightforward - \"Crucify Or Be Crucified\". (...) One need not take literally the grim tribal god on his mountain to recognize in today's America the votaries and prophets of Crom, who would take spiritual guidance from the Crucifixion of Conan rather than the Crucifixion of Jesus\".\n\n==Publication history==\nThe story was first published in the December 1934 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]''.<ref name=\"howardworks\">{{cite web |url=http://howardworks.com/storyw.htm#witc2 |title=A Witch Shall Be Born |work=HowardWorks |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>  The first reprint followed in 1949, when the story was published in the digest anthology ''[[Avon Fantasy Reader]]'' #10.<ref name=\"howardworks\" />  The novella was the cover story and main feature of both publications.\n\nA version of the story that was edited and altered by [[L.

The consolidations led to the formation of a nationwide film distribution system.\n\nIn 1917, Zukor acquired 50% of [[Lewis J. Selznick]]'s Select Pictures which led Selznick's publicity to wane. Later, however, Selznick bought out Zukor's share of Select Pictures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety109-1933-01#page/n283/mode/1up|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Lewis J.

He signed many of the leading early stars, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]], Marguerite Clark, Pauline Frederick, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Wallace Reid. With so many important players, Zukor also pioneered \"[[Block booking|Block Booking]]\" for Paramount Pictures, which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than 20 years.\n\nZukor was the driving force behind Paramount's success. Through the teens and twenties, he also built the Publix Theatres Corporation, a chain of nearly 2000 screens. He also ran two production studios, one in Astoria, New York (now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]]) and the other in Hollywood, California.\n\nIn 1926, Zukor hired independent producer B. P. Schulberg, who had an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became Paramount Publix Corporation.\n\nZukor was now turning out 60 features a year. He made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by [[Loew's|Loew's Enterprises]], and also continued to add more theaters to his own chain. By 1920 he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals. Thus he pioneered the concept, now the accepted practice in the film industry, by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts.\n\nZukor, ever the impresario,  bought a huge plot of ground at Broadway and 43d Street, over objections of his board of directors, to build the Paramount Theater and office building, a 39-story building that had its grand opening in 1926. He managed to keep stars like Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, and most important of all, Mary Pickford, under contract and happy to stay at Paramount.   At one point Miss Pickford told Zukor: \"You know, for years I've dreamed of making $20,000 a year before I was 20, and I'll be 20 very soon.\"\n\n\"I could take a hint,\" Zukor recalled wryly. \"She got the $20,000, and before long I was paying her $100,000 a year. Mary was a terrific businessman.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nZukor was, primarily, also a businessman. \"He did not take the same personal, down-to-the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer did,\" wrote ''The New York Times'' in Zukor's obit at the age of 103.   He became an early investor in radio, taking a 50 percent interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928, but selling it within a few years.\n\nPartner Lasky hung on until 1932,  when Paramount nearly collapsed in the Depression years, and he was blamed for this and tossed out.  The following year, Paramount went into receivership.  Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases were ultimately at fault. A bank-mandated reorganization team kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix theater chain went bankrupt. In 1936, Barney Balaban became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures, Inc. and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nHe eventually spent most of his time in New York, but spent the winter months in  Hollywood to check on his studio.  He served as president until 1936 when he was elevated to chairman of the board. He retired from Paramount Pictures in 1959 and in 1964 stepped down as chairman and assumed Chairman Emeritus status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875915,00.html |title=Personalities: Jun. 12, 1964 - TIME |publisher=Content.time.com |date=1964-06-12 |accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref> a position he held up until his death at the age of 103 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. \n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1897, he married Lottie Kaufman;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html New York Times: \"Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire\" by ALBIN KREBS] June 11, 1976</ref> they had two children, Eugene J.

He purchased an [[Armory (military)|armory]] on 26th Street in Manhattan and converted it into [[Chelsea Studios]], a movie studio that is still used today.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231&dq=%22221+West+26th%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22221%20West%2026th%22&f=false New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York - Richard Alleman - Broadway (February 1, 2005)] {{ISBN|0-7679-1634-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, the company merged with [[Jesse L. Lasky]]'s company to form [[Famous Players-Lasky]].\n\n==Paramount Pictures==\nThe [[Paramount Pictures Corporation]] was formed to distribute films made by Famous Players-Lasky, and a dozen smaller companies pulled into Zukor's corporate giant. The consolidations led to the formation of a nationwide film distribution system.\n\nIn 1917, Zukor acquired 50% of [[Lewis J. Selznick]]'s Select Pictures which led Selznick's publicity to wane. Later, however, Selznick bought out Zukor's share of Select Pictures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety109-1933-01#page/n283/mode/1up|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Lewis J.

He signed many of the leading early stars, including [[Mary Pickford]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]], Marguerite Clark, Pauline Frederick, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, and Wallace Reid. With so many important players, Zukor also pioneered \"[[Block booking|Block Booking]]\" for Paramount Pictures, which meant that an exhibitor who wanted a particular star's films had to buy a year's worth of other Paramount productions. It was this system that gave Paramount a leading position in the 1920s and 1930s, but which led the government to pursue it on antitrust grounds for more than 20 years.\n\nZukor was the driving force behind Paramount's success. Through the teens and twenties, he also built the Publix Theatres Corporation, a chain of nearly 2000 screens. He also ran two production studios, one in Astoria, New York (now the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]]) and the other in Hollywood, California.\n\nIn 1926, Zukor hired independent producer B. P. Schulberg, who had an unerring eye for new talent, to run the new West Coast operations. They purchased the Robert Brunton Studios, a 26-acre facility at 5451 Marathon Street for US$1 million.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In 1927, Famous Players-Lasky took the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Three years later, because of the importance of the Publix Theatres, it became Paramount Publix Corporation.\n\nZukor was now turning out 60 features a year. He made deals to show them all in theaters controlled by [[Loew's|Loew's Enterprises]], and also continued to add more theaters to his own chain. By 1920 he was in a position to charge what he wished for film rentals. Thus he pioneered the concept, now the accepted practice in the film industry, by which the distributor charges the exhibitor a percentage of box-office receipts.\n\nZukor, ever the impresario,  bought a huge plot of ground at Broadway and 43d Street, over objections of his board of directors, to build the Paramount Theater and office building, a 39-story building that had its grand opening in 1926. He managed to keep stars like Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, and most important of all, Mary Pickford, under contract and happy to stay at Paramount.   At one point Miss Pickford told Zukor: \"You know, for years I've dreamed of making $20,000 a year before I was 20, and I'll be 20 very soon.\"\n\n\"I could take a hint,\" Zukor recalled wryly. \"She got the $20,000, and before long I was paying her $100,000 a year. Mary was a terrific businessman.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nZukor was, primarily, also a businessman. \"He did not take the same personal, down-to-the-last-detail interest in the making of his movies that producer-executives such as Samuel Goldwyn and Louis B. Mayer did,\" wrote ''The New York Times'' in Zukor's obit at the age of 103.   He became an early investor in radio, taking a 50 percent interest in the new [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] in 1928, but selling it within a few years.\n\nPartner Lasky hung on until 1932,  when Paramount nearly collapsed in the Depression years, and he was blamed for this and tossed out.  The following year, Paramount went into receivership.  Zukor's over-expansion and use of overvalued Paramount stock for purchases were ultimately at fault. A bank-mandated reorganization team kept the company intact, and, miraculously, Zukor was kept on. In 1935, Paramount-Publix theater chain went bankrupt. In 1936, Barney Balaban became president, and Zukor was bumped up to chairman of the board. In this role, Zukor reorganized the company as Paramount Pictures, Inc. and was able to successfully bring the studio out of bankruptcy.\n\nHe eventually spent most of his time in New York, but spent the winter months in  Hollywood to check on his studio.  He served as president until 1936 when he was elevated to chairman of the board. He retired from Paramount Pictures in 1959 and in 1964 stepped down as chairman and assumed Chairman Emeritus status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875915,00.html |title=Personalities: Jun. 12, 1964 - TIME |publisher=Content.time.com |date=1964-06-12 |accessdate=2019-09-14}}</ref> a position he held up until his death at the age of 103 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. \n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1897, he married Lottie Kaufman;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0107.html New York Times: \"Adolph Zukor Is Dead at 103; Built Paramount Movie Empire\" by ALBIN KREBS] June 11, 1976</ref> they had two children, Eugene J.

President Kennedy was in a tenuous position, trying to contain Communism in Southeast Asia, but on the other hand, supporting an anti-Communist government that was not popular with its domestic citizens and was guilty of acts objectionable to the American public.<ref>{{cite web |title=JFK and Vietnam: The September 1963 TV Interviews |publisher= JFK Library |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/education/teachers/curricular-resources/high-school-curricular-resources/jfk-and-vietnam-the-september-1963-tv-interviews |website=www.jfklibrary.org |accessdate=26 September 2019}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> The Kennedy administration intervened in Vietnam in the early 1960s to, among other reasons, keep the South Vietnamese \"domino\" from falling. When Kennedy came to power there was concern that the communist-led [[Pathet Lao]] in Laos would provide the [[Viet Cong]] with bases, and that eventually they could take over Laos.<ref>Historical Briefings: JFK, the Cold War, and Vietnam</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favor of the domino theory==\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2018}}\nThe primary evidence for the domino theory is the spread of communist rule in three Southeast Asian countries in 1975, following the [[Vietnam War|communist takeover of Vietnam]]: South Vietnam (by the Viet Cong), Laos (by the Pathet Lao), and Cambodia (by the [[Khmer Rouge]]). It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 467,573] |isbn=0-06-019776-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 }}</ref> Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs. But we have to have the jobs if we are to stop Communism. We have done that, moving from simple to more complex skilled labor. If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"<ref>[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7</ref>\n\n[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.\n\nSome supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.\n\nLinguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm \"The Threat of a Good Example\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]</ref>\n\n== Significance of the domino theory ==\nThe domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country\u2019s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, [[Victor Cha]] portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan \u201cnot just to contain but also constrain potential \u2018rogue alliances\u2019 from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the United States struggled with the challenge of \u201crogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it \u201cfashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to \u201ccontrol their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one\u2019s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions. \n\n==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==\n[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.\n\nIn this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm \"Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005</ref> Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua.

By 1948, as a result of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the U.S., Korea was split into two regions, with separate governments, each claiming to be the legitimate government of Korea, and neither side accepting the border as permanent. In 1950 fighting broke out between Communists and Republicans that soon involved troops from China (on the Communists' side), and the United States and 15 allied countries (on the Republicans' side). Though the [[Korean War|war]] never officially ended, the fighting ended in 1953 with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that left Korea divided into two nations, [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]].\nMao Zedong's decision to take on the U.S. in the Korean War was a direct attempt to confront what the Communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-Communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese Communist regime was still consolidating its own power after winning the Chinese Civil War.\n\nThe first figure to propose the domino theory was President Harry S.

Such actions of the South Vietnamese government made it difficult for the [[Kennedy administration]]'s strong support for President Diem.

It can further be argued that before they finished taking Vietnam prior to the 1950s, the communist campaigns did not succeed in Southeast Asia.  Note the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]] in the [[Philippines]], and the increasing involvement with [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Communists]] by [[Sukarno]] of Indonesia from the late 1950s until he was deposed in 1967.  All of these were unsuccessful Communist attempts to take over Southeast Asian countries which stalled when communist forces were still focused in Vietnam.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] and the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] have argued that the U.S. intervention in Indochina, by giving the nations of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] time to consolidate and engage in economic growth, prevented a wider domino effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Kuan Yew |date=2000 |title=From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |page=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 467,573] |isbn=0-06-019776-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/467 }}</ref> Meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1975, Lee Kuan Yew argued that \"there is a tendency in the U.S. Congress not to want to export jobs.

If we stop this process, it will do more harm than you can every[sic] repair with aid. Don't cut off imports from Southeast Asia.\"<ref>[[:File:Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975(Gerald Ford Library)(1553067).pdf|Ford, Kissinger, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - May 8, 1975 (Gerald Ford Library)]], pg. 7</ref>\n\n[[McGeorge Bundy]] argued that the prospects for a domino effect, though high in the 1950s and early 1960s, were weakened in 1965 when the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian Communist Party was destroyed]] via death squads in the Indonesian genocide.  However, proponents believe that the efforts during the containment (i.e., Domino Theory) period ultimately led to the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.\n\nSome supporters of the domino theory note the history of communist governments supplying aid to communist revolutionaries in neighboring countries. For instance, China supplied the [[Viet Minh]], the North Vietnamese army, with troops and supplies, and the Soviet Union supplied them with tanks and heavy weapons. The fact that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Rouge were both originally part of the Vietminh, not to mention Hanoi's support for both in conjunction with the Viet Cong, also give credence to the theory.  The Soviet Union also heavily supplied Sukarno with military supplies and advisors from the time of the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia]], especially during and after the 1958 civil war in Sumatra.\n\nLinguist and political theorist [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote that he believes that the domino theory is roughly accurate, although he put a more positive spin on the threat, writing that communist and socialist movements became popular in poorer countries because they brought economic improvements to those countries in which they took power. For this reason, he wrote, the U.S. put so much effort into suppressing so-called \"people's movements\" in [[Chile]], Vietnam, [[Nicaragua]], Laos, [[Grenada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], etc. \"The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, 'Why not us?'\" Chomsky refers to this as the \"threat of a good example\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm \"The Threat of a Good Example\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724125605/http://www.chomsky.info/books/unclesam01.htm# |date=2015-07-24 }}, [[Noam Chomsky]]</ref>\n\n== Significance of the domino theory ==\nThe domino theory is significant because it underlines the importance of alliances, which may vary from rogue alliances to bilateral alliances. This implies that the domino theory is useful in evaluating a country\u2019s intent and purpose of forging an alliance with others, including a cluster of other countries within a particular region. While the intent and purpose may differ for every country, [[Victor Cha]] portrays the asymmetrical bilateral alliance between the United States and countries in East Asia as a strategic approach, where the United States is in control and power to either mobilize or stabilize its allies. This is supported by how the United States created asymmetrical bilateral alliances with the Republic of Korea, Republic of China and Japan \u201cnot just to contain but also constrain potential \u2018rogue alliances\u2019 from engaging in adventurist behavior that might it into larger military contingencies in the region or that could trigger a domino effect, with Asian countries falling to communism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Since the United States struggled with the challenge of \u201crogue alliances and the threat of falling dominoes combined to produce a dreaded entrapment scenario for the United States,\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> the domino theory further underscores the importance of bilateral alliances in international relations. This is evident in how the domino theory provided the United States with a coalition approach, where it \u201cfashioned a series of deep, tight bilateral alliances\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> with Asian countries including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to \u201ccontrol their ability to use force and to foster material and political dependency on the United States.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Hence, this indicates that the domino theory assists in observing the effect of forged alliances as a stepping stone or stumbling block within international relations. This underscores the correlation between domino theory and path dependency, where a retrospective collapse of one country falling to communism may not only have adverse effects to other countries but more importantly, on one\u2019s decision-making scope and competence in overcoming present and future challenges. Therefore, the domino theory is indubitably a significant theory which deals with the close relationship between micro-cause and macro-consequence, where it suggests such macro-consequences may result in long-term repercussions. \n\n==Applications to communism outside Southeast Asia==\n[[Michael Lind]] has argued that though the domino theory failed regionally, there was a global wave, as communist or [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] regimes came to power in [[People's Republic of Benin|Benin]], [[Derg|Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Madagascar]], [[Cape Verde]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], and [[Nicaragua]] during the 1970s. The global interpretation of the domino effect relies heavily upon the \"prestige\" interpretation of the theory, meaning that the success of Communist revolutions in some countries, though it did not provide material support to revolutionary forces in other countries, did contribute morale and rhetorical support.\n\nIn this vein, Argentine revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] wrote an essay, the \"Message to the Tricontinental\", in 1967, calling for \"two, three ... many Vietnams\" across the world.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm \"Rough Draft of History: 'All Right, Let's Get the  @#!*%  Out of Here'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126071737/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2005/Che-Guevara-Gott11aug05.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}, Richard Gott, August 11, 2005</ref> Historian [[Max Boot]] wrote, \"In the late 1970s, America's enemies seized power in countries from Mozambique to Iran to Nicaragua.

When the studio shelved the film fearing that it would receive an NC-17 rating,<ref name=\"fangoria\">{{cite journal|work=Fangoria|issue=199|pages=20\u201325|title=Death to False Horror|author=Szulkin, David}}</ref> Zombie re-acquired the rights and were eventually sold to [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], who released the film in April 2003. Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a [[cult following]], was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]], and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of \"The Museum of Monsters & Madmen\", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.\n\nThere they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother [[Otis Driftwood]], her deformed giant half-brother [[Tiny Firefly|Tiny]], Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.\n\nWhen Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table, and she screams in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Rob Zombie characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]]\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Baby\n* [[Karen Black]] as Mother Firefly\n* [[Chris Hardwick]] as Jerry Goldsmith\n* [[Erin Daniels]] as Denise Willis\n* [[Jennifer Jostyn]] as Mary Knowles\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Bill Hudley\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Steve Naish\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Deputy George Wydell\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny\n* [[Robert Allen Mukes]] as Rufus\n* [[Dennis Fimple]] as Grandpa Hugo\n* [[Harrison Young]] as Don Willis\n* [[William Bassett (actor)|William Bassett]] as Sheriff Frank Huston\n* [[Irwin Keyes]] as Ravelli\n* [[Michael J.

In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to have been revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a \"live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan\" that Zombie has in his house.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ulmer | first = Gary | title = Interview with the Zombie | periodical = Dark Realms Magazine | pages = 14\u201316 | volume = issue 11 | date = Summer 2003 | url = http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{Main|List of Rob Zombie characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| footer    = Bill Moseley (left) and Sid Haig (right) were generally praised by film critics for their roles in the film.\n| image1    = Billgfdl.jpg\n| width1    = 180\n| image2    = Haig, Sid (2007).jpg\n| width2    = 200\n}}\nThe film's main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others.<ref name=\"horrorhound\">{{citation|last =Newell|first =Eric|title=House of 1000 Corpses|journal=Horror Hound|volume=1|issue=36|pages=26\u201333| year= 2012}}</ref> Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities.<ref name=\"horrorhound\"/> Haig claimed he had to \"get in touch with [his] own insanity\" for the role.<ref name=aboutfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/devilsrejects/castinterviews.htm|title=Devil's Rejects - Cast Interviews|accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby.

Despite receiving an unfavorable response from critics, it went on to gross $16 million worldwide. Since its release, the film has achieved a [[cult following]], was developed into a haunted house attraction by Zombie for Universal Studios, and was followed by two sequels, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019).\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station, but are killed by the owner, [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]], and his assistant, Ravelli. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of \"The Museum of Monsters & Madmen\", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young free-spirited [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts (in what is later seen to be a trap) and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.\n\nThere they meet Baby's family: her adopted brother [[Otis Driftwood]], her deformed giant half-brother [[Tiny Firefly|Tiny]], Mother Firefly, and Grandpa Hugo. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house, after he suffered a psychotic breakdown. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As the couples leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack them in the driveway and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.\n\nWhen Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, a former policeman, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him; Don and Steve are then killed by Otis when they find more bodies of missing cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Mother Firefly's ex-husband Earl, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the back seat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table, and she screams in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Rob Zombie characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sid Haig]] as [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)|Captain Spaulding]]\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Otis\n* [[Sheri Moon Zombie]] as Baby\n* [[Karen Black]] as Mother Firefly\n* [[Chris Hardwick]] as Jerry Goldsmith\n* [[Erin Daniels]] as Denise Willis\n* [[Jennifer Jostyn]] as Mary Knowles\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Bill Hudley\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Steve Naish\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Deputy George Wydell\n* [[Matthew McGrory]] as Tiny\n* [[Robert Allen Mukes]] as Rufus\n* [[Dennis Fimple]] as Grandpa Hugo\n* [[Harrison Young]] as Don Willis\n* [[William Bassett (actor)|William Bassett]] as Sheriff Frank Huston\n* [[Irwin Keyes]] as Ravelli\n* [[Michael J.

Zombie later cited home recordings from the [[Charles Manson|Manson family]] as inspiration for the Firefly family's \"bizarre\" rants. Zombie often filmed two versions of scenes, one of them less gory, in an attempt to please Universal.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nJake McKinnon could not see well when dressed as The Professor, and almost hit actress Erin Daniels with a real ax during the film's climax. Zombie later said he had simply hoped Daniels would move out of the way in time. When Denise calls her father from a telephone booth, a sign for a missing dog head can be seen hanging in the booth; this was in fact a real item found by Zombie and used for the film. In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to have been revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a \"live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan\" that Zombie has in his house.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ulmer | first = Gary | title = Interview with the Zombie | periodical = Dark Realms Magazine | pages = 14\u201316 | volume = issue 11 | date = Summer 2003 | url = http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{Main|List of Rob Zombie characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| footer    = Bill Moseley (left) and Sid Haig (right) were generally praised by film critics for their roles in the film.\n| image1    = Billgfdl.jpg\n| width1    = 180\n| image2    = Haig, Sid (2007).jpg\n| width2    = 200\n}}\nThe film's main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others.<ref name=\"horrorhound\">{{citation|last =Newell|first =Eric|title=House of 1000 Corpses|journal=Horror Hound|volume=1|issue=36|pages=26\u201333| year= 2012}}</ref> Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities.<ref name=\"horrorhound\"/> Haig claimed he had to \"get in touch with [his] own insanity\" for the role.<ref name=aboutfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/devilsrejects/castinterviews.htm|title=Devil's Rejects - Cast Interviews|accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby.
