The site was chosen in the mid-1950s by Cantona's paternal grandmother, whose husband was a stonemason. By the time Cantona was born in 1966, the hillside cave had become little more than a room in the family's house, which was now up to a habitable standard. Cantona has two brothers: Jean-Marie, who is four years older, and [[Jo\u00ebl Cantona|Jo\u00ebl]], who is 17 months younger.\n\n== Club career==\n===Early career===\nCantona began his football career with SO Caillolais, his local team and one that had produced such talent as [[Roger Jouve]] and had players such as [[Jean Tigana]] and [[Christophe Galtier]] within its ranks. Originally, Cantona began to follow in his father's footsteps and often played as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], but his creative instincts began to take over and he would play up front more and more often. In his time with SO Caillolais, Cantona played in more than 200 matches.\n\n===France===\nCantona's first professional club was [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], where he spent two years in the youth team before making his debut on 5 November 1983, in a 4\u20130 league victory over Nancy.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nIn 1984 his footballing career was put on hold as he carried out his [[national service]].

His performances in the First Division were good enough to earn him his first full international [[cap (football)|cap]] when barely in his twenties. However, his disciplinary problems began in 1987 when he was fined for punching teammate [[Bruno Martini]] in the face.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-life-and-times-of-eric-cantona-1570034.html |title=The life and times of Eric Cantona |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe following year, Cantona was again in trouble because of a dangerous kung-fu tackle on Nantes player [[Michel Der Zakarian]], resulting in a three-month suspension,<ref name=\"timeline\"/> this was later reduced to a two-month suspension as his club Auxerre threatened to make the player unavailable for selection in the national team.

At Montpellier, he was involved in a fight with teammate [[Jean-Claude Lemoult]] and threw his boots in Lemoult's face.

However, the Marseille chairman [[Bernard Tapie]] was not satisfied with the results, and replaced Beckenbauer with [[Raymond Goethals]]; Cantona was continually at odds with Goethals and Tapie and, despite helping the team win the [[Ligue 1|French Division 1]] title, he was transferred to [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] the following season.\n\nIn December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, he threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the [[French Football Federation]] and was banned for one month. Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee in turn and calling him an \"idiot\". His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from football on 16 December 1991.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zJVUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6927,1151918&dq=eric-cantona&hl=en |title=Cantona packs it in |work=New Straits Times |via=Google News |date=18 December 1991 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe France national team coach, [[Michel Platini]], was a fan of Cantona, and persuaded him to make a comeback.

In a 2012 interview Francis explained that he had agreed to take Cantona on as a favour to Roach and Platini, who he knew from his time playing in Italy, and that it was intended as an opportunity for Cantona to put himself in the \"shop window\": Wednesday had only recently been promoted back to the top flight, with most of the squad still being on Second Division-level wages, and the club could not afford to sign him.

Two days later, Wilkinson announced that Leeds intended to complete Cantona's transfer from N\u00eemes for \u00a3900,000.

Later in 1998, Cantona organised a match of Manchester United players against other players from around the world in what was originally designed to be a memorial for the victims of the [[Munich Air Disaster]] in 1958 and their families, but which was merged with a [[Testimonial match|testimonial]] for Cantona himself.<ref>http://www.red11.org/mufc/matftest.htm</ref>\n\nIn his 1999 autobiography ''Managing My Life'', Alex Ferguson claimed that Cantona had informed him of his decision to retire from playing within 24 hours of Manchester United's [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] semi-final defeat to [[Borussia Dortmund]], though the decision was not made public for almost a month afterwards. During that time, there had been speculation about his future at Manchester United, including talk of a move to [[Real Zaragoza]] of Spain.\n\nReturning to Britain in 2003 to pick up the Overseas Player of the Decade Award at the [[Premier League 10 Seasons Awards]], Cantona said of his premature retirement, \"When you quit football it is not easy, your life becomes difficult.

Platini stated that whilst he was coach, Cantona would be selected for France as long as he was playing competitive top-class football; it was Platini who had initiated Cantona's move to England to restart his career. France qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] held in Sweden, but failed to win a single game despite the striking partnership of Cantona and [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]. Platini resigned after the finals to be replaced by [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]].\n\nUnder Houllier, France failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the U.S. after losing the final game 2\u20131 at home to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] when a draw would have sufficed. Houllier resigned and [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] took over. Jacquet began to rebuild the national team in preparation for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]] and appointed Cantona as captain. Cantona remained captain until the Selhurst Park incident in January 1995. The suspension which resulted from this incident also prevented him from playing in international matches.\n\nBy the time Cantona's suspension had been completed, he had lost his role as the team's playmaker to [[Zinedine Zidane]], as Jacquet had revamped the squad with some new players. Cantona, Papin and [[David Ginola]] lost their places in the squad and were never selected for the French team again, thus missing Euro 96. Though there was media criticism about Cantona's omission, as he was playing his best football in the [[Premier League]], Jacquet stated that the team had done well without Cantona, and that he wanted to keep faith with the players who had taken them so far.<ref>Wightman 2002, p. 198.</ref> In a 2015 interview with French radio network [[France Info]], Cantona stated that had he still been involved with the national side, he would have extended his career to feature in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], held in Cantona's home nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/barclays-premier-league/story/2626908/cantona-would-have-delayed-retirement-for-1998-world-cup|first=Mark|last=Rodden|title=Man United star Eric Cantona would've delayed retirement for France 1998 WC|work=ESPN FC|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nCantona still harbours resentment for the people at the head of his national team but also admiration for his adopted football country; at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], he supported England and not France.<ref name=\"blast\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3848181.stm |title=Cantona blasts France |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 June 2004 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n\n===Acting career===\n[[File:Looking for Eric Cannes 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Cantona (far right) at the premiere of [[Ken Loach]]\u2018s film ''[[Looking for Eric]]'' (2009) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. ]]\nHe focused his later career mostly as an actor in French cinema, having had his first role as a rugby player in ''[[Le bonheur est dans le pr\u00e9]]'', shot during his 1995 suspension from football.

The site was chosen in the mid-1950s by Cantona's paternal grandmother, whose husband was a stonemason. By the time Cantona was born in 1966, the hillside cave had become little more than a room in the family's house, which was now up to a habitable standard. Cantona has two brothers: Jean-Marie, who is four years older, and [[Jo\u00ebl Cantona|Jo\u00ebl]], who is 17 months younger.\n\n== Club career==\n===Early career===\nCantona began his football career with SO Caillolais, his local team and one that had produced such talent as [[Roger Jouve]] and had players such as [[Jean Tigana]] and [[Christophe Galtier]] within its ranks. Originally, Cantona began to follow in his father's footsteps and often played as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], but his creative instincts began to take over and he would play up front more and more often. In his time with SO Caillolais, Cantona played in more than 200 matches.\n\n===France===\nCantona's first professional club was [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]], where he spent two years in the youth team before making his debut on 5 November 1983, in a 4\u20130 league victory over Nancy.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nIn 1984 his footballing career was put on hold as he carried out his [[national service]]. After his discharge he was loaned out to [[FC Martigues|Martigues]]<ref name=\"timeline\"/> in the French Second Division before rejoining Auxerre and signing a professional contract in 1986. His performances in the First Division were good enough to earn him his first full international [[cap (football)|cap]] when barely in his twenties. However, his disciplinary problems began in 1987 when he was fined for punching teammate [[Bruno Martini]] in the face.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-life-and-times-of-eric-cantona-1570034.html |title=The life and times of Eric Cantona |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe following year, Cantona was again in trouble because of a dangerous kung-fu tackle on Nantes player [[Michel Der Zakarian]], resulting in a three-month suspension,<ref name=\"timeline\"/> this was later reduced to a two-month suspension as his club Auxerre threatened to make the player unavailable for selection in the national team.

At Montpellier, he was involved in a fight with teammate [[Jean-Claude Lemoult]] and threw his boots in Lemoult's face.

However, the Marseille chairman [[Bernard Tapie]] was not satisfied with the results, and replaced Beckenbauer with [[Raymond Goethals]]; Cantona was continually at odds with Goethals and Tapie and, despite helping the team win the [[Ligue 1|French Division 1]] title, he was transferred to [[N\u00eemes Olympique|N\u00eemes]] the following season.\n\nIn December 1991, during a match for N\u00eemes, he threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the [[French Football Federation]] and was banned for one month. Cantona responded by walking up to each member of the hearing committee in turn and calling him an \"idiot\". His ban was increased to two months, and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from football on 16 December 1991.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zJVUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6927,1151918&dq=eric-cantona&hl=en |title=Cantona packs it in |work=New Straits Times |via=Google News |date=18 December 1991 |accessdate=25 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe France national team coach, [[Michel Platini]], was a fan of Cantona, and persuaded him to make a comeback.

Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason.\n\nAfter being turned down by Liverpool, Cantona was given a trial at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] when Wednesday manager [[Trevor Francis]] was approached by Platini and Francis' former agent, Dennis Roach. In a 2012 interview Francis explained that he had agreed to take Cantona on as a favour to Roach and Platini, who he knew from his time playing in Italy, and that it was intended as an opportunity for Cantona to put himself in the \"shop window\": Wednesday had only recently been promoted back to the top flight, with most of the squad still being on Second Division-level wages, and the club could not afford to sign him.

Two days later, Wilkinson announced that Leeds intended to complete Cantona's transfer from N\u00eemes for \u00a3900,000.

Dubbed the 'Mission Impossible', Cantona and [[Gordon Strachan]] combined to set up [[Gary Speed]], who scored with a left-footed volley. [[Andreas Buck]] equalised for Stuttgart in the 34th minute, the [[Away goals rule|away goal]] meaning that Leeds needed another four to progress. McAllister scored a penalty just before half-time to make it 2\u20131 to Leeds before Cantona's looping shot in the 66th minute was deflected into his own net by [[G\u00fcnther Sch\u00e4fer]]. Chapman's header at the near post made it 4\u20131 in the 78th minute but Stuttgart remained firm and denied Leeds the decisive fifth goal. However, Leeds received a stroke of luck when it emerged after the match that Stuttgart's coach, [[Christoph Daum]], had fielded four 'foreign' players, one more than allowed. Leeds were awarded a 3\u20130 victory by UEFA, and a play-off match was ordered at the neutral [[Camp Nou]] in Barcelona on 9 October.<ref>Auclair (2009), pp. 225\u20136.</ref>\n\nAn exhausted Leeds then stumbled to a 4\u20132 defeat at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], with Cantona's form dipping through fatigue and injury.

Cantona was then guilty of \"two dreadful misses\" as [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] knocked them out of the League Cup on 10 November. Despite suffering along with his team, Wilkinson, rather than Cantona, was held responsible, after having to reinvigorate a side with a number of ageing stars. Despite Cantona scoring (with his shoulder) for France against Finland four days later, Wilkinson kept him out of the team, citing an unconvincing excuse of a \"groin strain\", as Leeds pulled off an improbable but resounding 3\u20130 win over Arsenal, ending the Gunners' six-game winning run.<ref>Auclair (2009), p. 234.</ref> Furious at being dropped, Cantona refused to report for training and faxed a transfer request to the club on 24 November, stating a preference to join Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal.<ref>Auclair (2009), pp. 234\u20135</ref>\n\n====Manchester United====\n=====Transfer from Leeds United=====\nThe news of Cantona's impending transfer from Leeds to fierce rivals Manchester United was met with hostility from Leeds fans.

Platini stated that whilst he was coach, Cantona would be selected for France as long as he was playing competitive top-class football; it was Platini who had initiated Cantona's move to England to restart his career. France qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 1992]] held in Sweden, but failed to win a single game despite the striking partnership of Cantona and [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]. Platini resigned after the finals to be replaced by [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]].\n\nUnder Houllier, France failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the U.S. after losing the final game 2\u20131 at home to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] when a draw would have sufficed. Houllier resigned and [[Aim\u00e9 Jacquet]] took over. Jacquet began to rebuild the national team in preparation for [[1996 European Football Championship|Euro 96]] and appointed Cantona as captain. Cantona remained captain until the Selhurst Park incident in January 1995.

{"title_page": "Ad serving", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n'''Ad serving''' describes the technology and service that places [[Advertising|advertisement]]s on [[Website|Web site]]s. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Web sites and advertisers to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money, and monitor progress of different [[advertising campaign]]s. Ad servers are divided into two types\u2014publisher ad servers and advertiser (or third party) ad servers.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn ad server is a Web server that stores advertising content used in online marketing and delivers that content onto various digital platforms such as Websites, social media outlets and mobile apps. An ad server is merely the technology in which the advertising material is stored and is the means of distributing that material into appropriate advertising slots online. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Websites and advertising companies to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money and monitor the progress of different online advertising campaigns. The purpose of ad serving is to deliver ads to users, to manage the advertising space of a Web site and, in the case of third party ad servers, to provide an independent counting and [[web tracking|tracking]] system for advertisers/marketers. Ad servers also act as a system in which advertisers can count clicks/impressions in order to generate reports, which helps to determine the return on investment for an advertisement on a particular Web page.\n\nThere are separate ad servers that publishers and third party (e.g. advertisers, marketers) use. Essentially, there is no difference in the technology that the ad servers provide, the key difference being the accessibility of data for optimized tracking and convenience. Advertisers and marketers use a centralized ad server that enables them to draw progress reports on demand and update their creative content in one place, rather than using individual publisher ad servers in which they will have to manage content across multiple servers with different publishers. Without this centralized hub which controls advertisers' rotation and distribution of content across the Web, there becomes issues around tracking and management of advertising material. If an advertiser had to make contact with each individual publisher whose ad server they are using, this would mean multiple sets of data to track and would also mean they need to update their creative content for each individual channel. This provides less-accurate, less-timely, and ultimately inconvenient results for advertisers. Publishers have separate ad servers to communicate advertising material across their domains only. This enables convenience for the publisher, as they will have access only to the advertising content they require for their publication rather than sort through an ad server containing all the advertising content in which Marketers/Advertisers are using.\n\n== History ==\nThe first central ad server was released by FocaLink Media Services and introduced on July 17, 1995,<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/FocalinkPressRelease.JPG Hyperlink Advertising Explodes on the World Wide Web], company press release</ref> for controlling the delivery of online advertising or banner ads. Although most contemporary accounts are no longer available online, the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] published an academic research paper documenting the launch of the first ad server.<ref>[http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/COURSE/PRIVACY/fop_itay_targeted_online_advertising.ppt Targeted Online Advertising], academic research</ref> The original motherboard for the first ad server, assembled in June 1995, is also preserved.<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/Mango.JPG] photograph, motherboard of first ad server</ref>  Digiyouth re-launched the ad server under the name SmartBanner in February 1996.<ref>[https://youthdevelopmentprogram.co.in/ NO.1 Digital Marketing School And Agency in Delhi-Gurgaon to Learn Digital Marketing]|date= April 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, company press release</ref>  The company was founded by Dave Zinman, Andrew Conru and Jason Strober, and based in [[Palo Alto, California]]. In 1998, the company changed its name to AdKnowledge, and was purchased by CMGI in 1999.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/business/company-news-engage-technologies-agrees-to-buy-adknowledge.html New York Times contemporary news coverage]</ref>  The AdKnowledge name was subsequently purchased by a company in Kansas City in 2004, which now operates under the brand name AdKnowledge.\n\nThe first local ad server was released by NetGravity in January 1996<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19980526003204/http://www.netgravity.com/news/pressrel/launch.html NetGravity Launches AdServer, the Premier Advertising Management System Software for World Wide Web Publishers], company press release</ref> for delivering [[online advertising]] at major publishing sites such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[Pathfinder (website)|Pathfinder]]. The company was founded by Tom Shields and John Danner, and based in [[San Mateo, California]]. In 1998, the company went public on [[NASDAQ]] (NETG), and was purchased by [[DoubleClick]] in 1999. NetGravity AdServer was then renamed to DART Enterprise. In March 2008 Google acquired DoubleClick. Google has continued to improve and invest in DART Enterprise. The latest version of the product was renamed and shipped as DoubleClick Enterprise 8.0 on September 28, 2011.<ref>http://www.google.com/support/de/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=25797&topic=27665&answer=174348</ref>\n\nAnother central or remote ad server was introduced by David Stein at Burst Media in January 1996 for controlling [[online advertising]] or [[Web banner|banner ads]]. The ad server/ad management platform was renamed AdConductor and is still used by the company today.{{who|date=March 2018}}{{when|date=March 2018}}  The company was founded by Jarvis Coffin, David Stein and Bob Hanna, and based in [[Katonah, New York]]. In 2006, the company went public on the London Stock Exchange's [[Alternative Investment Market]] (BRST) and in 2011 was acquired by [[Blinkx]].\n\n==Functionality==\n===Common functions=== \nThe common functions of ad serving are as follows; to upload advertisements and rich media, to traffic ads according to differing business rules, to target ads to different users, or content, to tune and to optimize based on results and to report impressions, clicks, post-click and post-impression activities and interaction metrics. All of these functions are an integral part of running an online advertising campaign in making sure that the advertising content is being displayed where and for whom it is intended. It also helps with analysis to see just how effective the campaign is and whether or not the content is generating the desired results.  Ad serving also offers more advanced functions for more sophisticated advertising campaigns. Advanced functions include frequency capping, [[Creative sequencing|sequencing ads]] (also referred to as surround sessions), [[search engine optimization]] and targeting (See Ad targeting and optimization, below). Frequency capping is limiting how many times a user will see the content. Advertisers are also able to limit ads by setting a cap on money-spending.\n\n== Ad targeting and optimization ==\nOne aspect of ad-serving technology is automated and semi-automated means of optimizing bid prices, placement, targeting, or other characteristics.  Significant methods include:\n* [[Behavioral targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 using a profile of prior behavior on the part of the viewer to determine which ad to show during a given visit. For example, targeting car ads on a portal to a viewer that was known to have visited the automotive section of a general media site.<ref name=\"Chen 2014 429\u2013449\">{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jianqing|author2=Jan Stallaert|title=An Economic Analysis of Online Advertising Using Behavioral Targeting|journal=MIS Quarterly|year=2014|volume=38|issue=2|pages=429\u2013449}}</ref> \n* [[Contextual advertising|Contextual targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 (also known as Semantic Marketing) refers to the optimum ad placement as a result of analysing information from the entire Web page where the ad is being served. This concept was introduced as a way of improving the \u2018keyword approach' to ad placement where issues surrounding ambiguity in relation to a word's meaning in the prescribed context.  The concept of analysing the \u2018entire' Webpage in order to promote relevant advertising material is to benefit both the viewer of advertising content and the source of the ad. Keywords (or Adwords) are not always relevant in the context in which the word is intended. Therefore, by analysing the entire page rather than just the keyword, the ambiguity is removed and a more relevant and accurate ad is promoted into the advertising slot on the Web page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/divyank-turakhia-directi-tctv/|title=From Bootstrapping To $300M In Value: Meet The Founder Of Directi (TCTV)|last=Wauters|first=Robin|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n* Creative optimization&nbsp;\u2014 using experimental or predictive methods to explore the optimum creative for a given ad placement and exploiting that determination in further impressions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affiliate marketing]]\n*[[Ad exchange|Ad Exchange]]\n* [[Compensation methods]]\n* [[Contextual advertising]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Landing page]]\n* [[List of advertising networks]]\n* [[Pay-per-click]]\n* [[Pay per play]]\n* [[Website monetization]]\n* [[View-through rate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n'''Ad serving''' describes the technology and service that places [[Advertising|advertisement]]s on [[Website|Web site]]s. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Web sites and advertisers to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money, and monitor progress of different [[advertising campaign]]s. Ad servers are divided into two types\u2014publisher ad servers and advertiser (or third party) ad servers.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn ad server is a Web server that stores advertising content used in online marketing and delivers that content onto various digital platforms such as Websites, social media outlets and mobile apps. An ad server is merely the technology in which the advertising material is stored and is the means of distributing that material into appropriate advertising slots online. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Websites and advertising companies to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money and monitor the progress of different online advertising campaigns. The purpose of ad serving is to deliver ads to users, to manage the advertising space of a Web site and, in the case of third party ad servers, to provide an independent counting and [[web tracking|tracking]] system for advertisers/marketers. Ad servers also act as a system in which advertisers can count clicks/impressions in order to generate reports, which helps to determine the return on investment for an advertisement on a particular Web page.\n\nThere are separate ad servers that publishers and third party (e.g. advertisers, marketers) use. Essentially, there is no difference in the technology that the ad servers provide, the key difference being the accessibility of data for optimized tracking and convenience. Advertisers and marketers use a centralized ad server that enables them to draw progress reports on demand and update their creative content in one place, rather than using individual publisher ad servers in which they will have to manage content across multiple servers with different publishers. Without this centralized hub which controls advertisers' rotation and distribution of content across the Web, there becomes issues around tracking and management of advertising material. If an advertiser had to make contact with each individual publisher whose ad server they are using, this would mean multiple sets of data to track and would also mean they need to update their creative content for each individual channel. This provides less-accurate, less-timely, and ultimately inconvenient results for advertisers. Publishers have separate ad servers to communicate advertising material across their domains only. This enables convenience for the publisher, as they will have access only to the advertising content they require for their publication rather than sort through an ad server containing all the advertising content in which Marketers/Advertisers are using.\n\n== History ==\nThe first central ad server was released by FocaLink Media Services and introduced on July 17, 1995,<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/FocalinkPressRelease.JPG Hyperlink Advertising Explodes on the World Wide Web], company press release</ref> for controlling the delivery of online advertising or banner ads. Although most contemporary accounts are no longer available online, the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] published an academic research paper documenting the launch of the first ad server.<ref>[http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/COURSE/PRIVACY/fop_itay_targeted_online_advertising.ppt Targeted Online Advertising], academic research</ref> The original motherboard for the first ad server, assembled in June 1995, is also preserved.<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/Mango.JPG] photograph, motherboard of first ad server</ref>  Focalink re-launched the ad server under the name SmartBanner in February 1996.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17920425.html First Advertising Server Launched On Internet; Focalink's Technology, Services and Information Creates Marketing Infrastructure for the Net]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, company press release</ref>  The company was founded by Dave Zinman, Andrew Conru and Jason Strober, and based in [[Palo Alto, California]]. In 1998, the company changed its name to AdKnowledge, and was purchased by CMGI in 1999.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/business/company-news-engage-technologies-agrees-to-buy-adknowledge.html New York Times contemporary news coverage]</ref>  The AdKnowledge name was subsequently purchased by a company in Kansas City in 2004, which now operates under the brand name AdKnowledge.\n\nThe first local ad server was released by NetGravity in January 1996<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19980526003204/http://www.netgravity.com/news/pressrel/launch.html NetGravity Launches AdServer, the Premier Advertising Management System Software for World Wide Web Publishers], company press release</ref> for delivering [[online advertising]] at major publishing sites such as [[Yahoo!]] and [[Pathfinder (website)|Pathfinder]]. The company was founded by Tom Shields and John Danner, and based in [[San Mateo, California]]. In 1998, the company went public on [[NASDAQ]] (NETG), and was purchased by [[DoubleClick]] in 1999. NetGravity AdServer was then renamed to DART Enterprise. In March 2008 Google acquired DoubleClick. Google has continued to improve and invest in DART Enterprise. The latest version of the product was renamed and shipped as DoubleClick Enterprise 8.0 on September 28, 2011.<ref>http://www.google.com/support/de/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=25797&topic=27665&answer=174348</ref>\n\nAnother central or remote ad server was introduced by David Stein at Burst Media in January 1996 for controlling [[online advertising]] or [[Web banner|banner ads]]. The ad server/ad management platform was renamed AdConductor and is still used by the company today.{{who|date=March 2018}}{{when|date=March 2018}}  The company was founded by Jarvis Coffin, David Stein and Bob Hanna, and based in [[Katonah, New York]]. In 2006, the company went public on the London Stock Exchange's [[Alternative Investment Market]] (BRST) and in 2011 was acquired by [[Blinkx]].\n\n==Functionality==\n===Common functions=== \nThe common functions of ad serving are as follows; to upload advertisements and rich media, to traffic ads according to differing business rules, to target ads to different users, or content, to tune and to optimize based on results and to report impressions, clicks, post-click and post-impression activities and interaction metrics. All of these functions are an integral part of running an online advertising campaign in making sure that the advertising content is being displayed where and for whom it is intended. It also helps with analysis to see just how effective the campaign is and whether or not the content is generating the desired results.  Ad serving also offers more advanced functions for more sophisticated advertising campaigns. Advanced functions include frequency capping, [[Creative sequencing|sequencing ads]] (also referred to as surround sessions), [[search engine optimization]] and targeting (See Ad targeting and optimization, below). Frequency capping is limiting how many times a user will see the content. Advertisers are also able to limit ads by setting a cap on money-spending.\n\n== Ad targeting and optimization ==\nOne aspect of ad-serving technology is automated and semi-automated means of optimizing bid prices, placement, targeting, or other characteristics.  Significant methods include:\n* [[Behavioral targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 using a profile of prior behavior on the part of the viewer to determine which ad to show during a given visit. For example, targeting car ads on a portal to a viewer that was known to have visited the automotive section of a general media site.<ref name=\"Chen 2014 429\u2013449\">{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jianqing|author2=Jan Stallaert|title=An Economic Analysis of Online Advertising Using Behavioral Targeting|journal=MIS Quarterly|year=2014|volume=38|issue=2|pages=429\u2013449}}</ref> \n* [[Contextual advertising|Contextual targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 (also known as Semantic Marketing) refers to the optimum ad placement as a result of analysing information from the entire Web page where the ad is being served. This concept was introduced as a way of improving the \u2018keyword approach' to ad placement where issues surrounding ambiguity in relation to a word's meaning in the prescribed context.  The concept of analysing the \u2018entire' Webpage in order to promote relevant advertising material is to benefit both the viewer of advertising content and the source of the ad. Keywords (or Adwords) are not always relevant in the context in which the word is intended. Therefore, by analysing the entire page rather than just the keyword, the ambiguity is removed and a more relevant and accurate ad is promoted into the advertising slot on the Web page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/divyank-turakhia-directi-tctv/|title=From Bootstrapping To $300M In Value: Meet The Founder Of Directi (TCTV)|last=Wauters|first=Robin|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n* Creative optimization&nbsp;\u2014 using experimental or predictive methods to explore the optimum creative for a given ad placement and exploiting that determination in further impressions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affiliate marketing]]\n*[[Ad exchange|Ad Exchange]]\n* [[Compensation methods]]\n* [[Contextual advertising]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Landing page]]\n* [[List of advertising networks]]\n* [[Pay-per-click]]\n* [[Pay per play]]\n* [[Website monetization]]\n* [[View-through rate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n", "name_user": "ANUJydp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_serving"}

It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes over time and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.<r\u2018The Rise of a \u2018New Hoplology\u2019 and the ILF Expedition to Barbados\u2019:  What it can be, what it can do, and the results of a Hoplological  expedition to Barbados.\u201d  Martial Arts, Culture and Politics (5Th annual Martial Arts Studies Conference).

Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.
