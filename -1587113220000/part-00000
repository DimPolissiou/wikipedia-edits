They are completely sealed from the area that is heated, and vent all exhaust gasses to the exterior of the structure.\n\nChimney and flue types:\n* [[Masonry]] (brick or stone fireplaces and chimneys) with or without tile-lined flue.\n* [[Reinforced concrete]] chimneys. Fundamental design flaws bankrupted the US manufacturers and made the design obsolete. These chimneys often show vertical cracks on the exterior.\n* Metal-lined flue: Double- or triple-walled metal pipe running up inside a new or existing wood-framed or masonry chase.\n\nNewly constructed flues may feature a chase cover, a cap, and a spark arrestor at the top to keep small animals out and to prevent sparks from being broadcast into the atmosphere. All fireplaces require trained gas service members to carry out installations.\n\n===Accessories===\nA wide range of accessories are used with fireplaces, which range between countries, regions, and historical periods. For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, [[fireguard]]s, log boxes, [[andiron]]s and pellet baskets, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of [[iron]] bars, to retain [[fuel]] for a [[fire]]. Heavy metal [[Fireplace fireback|fireback]]s are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect the back of the fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set in front of the fireplace to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include [[Fireplace poker|poker]]s, [[bellows]], [[tongs]], shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.evansfireplaces.com/|title=Fireplaces Leicester Accessories|last=Jonathan|first=Admin|date=|website=Evans Fireplace Centre|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kochen \u00fcber offenem Feuer.JPG|thumb|Cooking over a fireplace]]\nAncient fire pits were sometimes built in the ground, within caves, or in the center of a hut or dwelling. Evidence of prehistoric, man-made fires exists on all five inhabited continents. The disadvantage of early indoor fire pits was that they produced toxic and/or irritating smoke inside the dwelling.\n\nFire pits developed into raised [[hearth]]s in buildings, but venting smoke depended on open windows or holes in roofs. The medieval [[great hall]] typically had a centrally located hearth, where an open fire burned with the smoke rising to the vent in the roof. [[Louver]]s were developed during the Middle Ages to allow the roof vents to be covered so rain and snow would not enter.\n\nAlso during the Middle Ages, [[Smoke canopy|smoke canopies]] were invented to prevent smoke from spreading through a room and vent it out through a wall or roof. These could be placed against stone walls, instead of taking up the middle of the room, and this allowed smaller rooms to be heated.\n\n[[Chimney]]s were invented in northern Europe in the 11th or 12th centuries and largely fixed the problem of fumes, more reliably venting smoke outside. They made it possible to give the fireplace a draft, and also made it possible to put fireplaces in multiple rooms in buildings conveniently. They did not come into general use immediately, however, as they were expensive to build and maintain.\n\nIn 1678, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], nephew of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], raised the grate of the fireplace, improving the airflow and venting system. The 18th century saw two important developments in the history of fireplaces. [[Benjamin Franklin]] developed a [[Franklin fireplace|convection chamber for the fireplace]] that greatly improved the efficiency of fireplaces and wood stoves. He also improved the airflow by pulling air from a basement and venting out a longer area at the top. In the later 18th century, [[Count Rumford]] designed a fireplace with a tall, shallow firebox that was better at drawing the smoke up and out of the building. The shallow design also improved greatly the amount of radiant heat projected into the room. Rumford's design is the foundation for modern fireplaces.\n\nThe Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and 1880s took on a more traditional spectra based on stone and deflected unnecessary ornamentation. Rather it relied on simple designs with little unnecessary ornamentation. In the 1890s the Aesthetic movement gave way to the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] movement, where the emphasis was still placed on providing quality stone. Stone fireplaces at this time were a symbol of prosperity, which to some degree is still the notion today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firecraft.co.uk/|title=Traditional Stone Fireplaces|last=Admin|first=Charlie|date=|website=Stone Fireplaces|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution of fireplace design===\n[[File:Sherlock Holmes Museum 001.jpg|thumb|[[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian style]] \"sitting room\" with a fireplace in the [[Sherlock Holmes Museum]], London]]\nOver time, the purpose of fireplaces has changed from one of necessity to one of visual interest.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zxORCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA627&dq=Over+time+the+design+of+fireplaces+has+changed+from+one+of+necessity+to+one+of+visual+interest#v=onepage&q=Over%20time%20the%20design%20of%20fireplaces%20has%20changed%20from%20one%20of%20necessity%20to%20one%20of%20visual%20interest&f=false|title=Architectural Graphic Standards|last=Architects|first=American Institute of|date=2016-03-21|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118909508|language=en}}</ref> Early ones were more fire pits than modern fireplaces. They were used for warmth on cold days and nights, as well as for cooking. They also served as a gathering place within the home. These fire pits were usually centered within a room, allowing more people to gather around it.\n\nMany flaws were found in early fireplace designs. Along with the Industrial Revolution, came large-scale housing developments, necessitating a standardization of fireplaces. The most renowned fireplace designers of this time were the Adam Brothers. They perfected a style of fireplace design that was used for generations. It was smaller, more brightly lit, with an emphasis on the quality of the materials used in their construction, instead of their size.\n\nBy the 1800s most new fireplaces were made up of two parts, the surround and the insert. The surround consisted of the mantelpiece and side supports, usually in wood, marble or granite. The insert was where the fire burned, and was constructed of cast iron often backed with decorative [[tiles]]. As well as providing heat, the fireplaces of the [[Victorian era]] were thought to add a cosy ambiance to homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fireplaceantiques.co.uk/Category/history-of-the-antique-fireplace/865|title=History of the Antique Fireplace|work=fireplaceantiques.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"160\" caption=\"Fireplace decors\">\nFile:Green dining_room - fireplace 01.jpg|Marble fireplace in the green dining room of [[Catherine Palace]].

Fireplace efficiency can also be increased with the use of a fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three Steps to a More Efficient Fireplace|url=http://fireplacemall.com/blog/2012/three-steps-to-a-more-efficient-fireplace/|date=2012-01-17}}</ref> Efficiency is a complicated concept though with open hearth fireplaces. Most efficiency tests consider just the effect of heating of the air. An open fireplace is not, and never was, intended to heat the air. A fireplace with a fireback is a radiant heater, and has done so since the 15th century. The best way to gauge the output of a fireplace is if you notice you're turning the thermostat up or down.\n\nMost older fireplaces have a relatively low efficiency rating. Standard, modern, wood-burning [[masonry heater|masonry fireplaces]] though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement for example in Salzburg, Austria).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=LrSbg&Gesetzesnummer=20000675|title=RIS - Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift f\u00fcr Heizungsanlagen-Verordnung 2010 - Landesrecht Salzburg, Fassung vom 18.07.2015|work=bka.gv.at}}</ref> To improve efficiency,  fireplaces can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air.  These modified fireplaces are often equipped with a large fire window, enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry fireplaces without a glass fire window only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on outside temperatures 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature.\n\n==Health effects==\n===Wood===\nA literature review published in the ''[[Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health]]'' concludes that there are a wide variety of health risks posed by residential wood combustion. It states:\n{{quote|With regard to adults, studies show that prolonged inhalation of [[wood smoke]] contributed to [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], chronic interstitial [[lung disease]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]] and [[corpulmonale]], and altered pulmonary immune defense mechanisms. While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC [Residential Wood Combustion] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary [[lung]] function in young [[asthmatics]]; increased incidence of acute [[bronchitis]] and severity/frequency of [[wheezing]] and [[coughing]]; and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute [[respiratory infections]].\n\nResidential wood combustion [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] also contain [[Lower sulfur oxides|sulfur oxides]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[carbon monoxide]] and potentially [[carcinogenic]] compounds including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]. Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.<ref>Zelikoff, J.T., 2002. \"[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.5601&rep=rep1&type=pdf The Toxicology of Inhaled Woodsmoke]\". ''Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B'', 5:269-282</ref>}}\nThe [[Washington Department of Ecology]] also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and respiratory systems are unable to filter [[Particulates|particles emitted by wood combustion]], which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, cancer-causing chemicals can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with respiratory disorders are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children because it is associated with [[lower respiratory tract infection]]s.<ref name=Ecology>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/92046.pdf |title=Washington's Department of Ecology, \"Health Effects of Wood Smoke\", 1997, Retrieved February 3 2012 |access-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410042830/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/92046.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Home fireplaces have caused fatal [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/derek-kehler-and-helena-curic-identified-as-young-couple-killed-in-kurrajong-cabin-20150609-ghk7yb.html|title=Derek Kehler and Helena Curic identified as young couple killed in Kurrajong cabin|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gasses and ethanol===\n[[Propane]], [[butane]], and [[methane]] are all flammable gasses used in fireplaces ([[natural gas]] is mostly methane, [[liquefied petroleum gas]] mostly propane).

Fireplaces are used for the relaxing ambiance they create and for heating a room. Modern fireplaces vary in heat efficiency, depending on the design.\n\nHistorically they were used for heating a dwelling, cooking, and heating water for laundry and domestic uses. A fire is contained in a [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]] or firepit; a [[chimney]] or other [[flue]] allows exhaust to escape. A fireplace may have the following: a foundation, a [[hearth]], a [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]], a [[fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]]; a [[chimney crane]] (used in kitchen and laundry fireplaces), a grate, a [[lintel]], a lintel bar, home [[overmantel]], a [[Damper (architecture)|damper]], a smoke chamber, a throat, a [[flue]], and a chimney [[Filtration|filter]] or afterburner.<ref>[http://www.biopress.dk/PDF/FiB%20nr.%2021-2007_05%20-%20UK.pdf Chimney filters can save billions]</ref>\n\nOn the exterior there is often a corbelled brick crown, in which the projecting courses of brick act as a drip course to keep rainwater from running down the exterior walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or metal liners than with the traditional [[masonry]] chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a [[spark arrestor]] incorporated into the crown or cap.\n\nOrganizations like the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Washington Department of Ecology]] warn that, according to various studies, [[#Health effects|fireplaces can pose a significant health risk]].<ref name=EPA>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/healtheffects.html|title=Health Effects - Burn Wise - US EPA|work=epa.gov|date=2013-05-08}}</ref><ref name=Ecology/> The EPA writes \"[[Smoke]] may smell good, but it's not good for you.\"<ref name=EPA/>\n\n==Types of fireplaces==\n* Manufactured fireplaces are made with sheet metal or glass fire boxes.\n* [[Electric fireplace]]s can be built-in replacements for wood or gas or retrofit with log inserts or electric fireboxes.\n* A few types are, wall mounted electric fireplaces, electric fireplace stoves, electric mantel fireplaces and fixed or free standing electric fireplaces.\n\nMasonry and prefabricated fireplaces can be fueled by:\n\n*[[Wood]] and  other [[biomass]]\n*[[Charcoal]] (carbonized biomass)\n*[[Coal]]\n*[[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] (carbonized coal)\n*Flammable gasses: [[propane]], [[butane]], and [[methane]] ([[natural gas]] is mostly methane, [[liquefied petroleum gas]] mostly propane)\n*[[Ethanol fireplace|Ethanol]] (a liquid alcohol, also sold in gels)\n\n<center><gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Traditional Himalayan Tandoor.jpg|Traditional Himalayan Tandoor\nFile:Fireplace Burning.jpg|Wood-burning fireplace with [[Andiron|fire dogs]]\nFile:NT Typical gas log fireplace (5114230942).jpg|A gas-powered fireplace\nFile:Electric_Fireplace.jpg|Electric fireplace\nFireplace (Serbia).jpg|Traditional Serbian Ognji\u0161te\n</gallery></center>\n\nVentless fireplaces (duct free/room-venting fireplaces) are fueled by either gel, liquid propane, bottled gas or natural gas.{{clarify|date=December 2019}} In the United States, some states and local counties have laws restricting these types of fireplaces.

Fundamental design flaws bankrupted the US manufacturers and made the design obsolete. These chimneys often show vertical cracks on the exterior.\n* Metal-lined flue: Double- or triple-walled metal pipe running up inside a new or existing wood-framed or masonry chase.\n\nNewly constructed flues may feature a chase cover, a cap, and a spark arrestor at the top to keep small animals out and to prevent sparks from being broadcast into the atmosphere.

For the interior, common in recent Western cultures include grates, [[fireguard]]s, log boxes, [[andiron]]s and pellet baskets, all of which cradle fuel and accelerate burning. A grate (or fire grate) is a frame, usually of [[iron]] bars, to retain [[fuel]] for a [[fire]]. Heavy metal [[Fireplace fireback|fireback]]s are sometimes used to capture and re-radiate heat, to protect the back of the fireplace, and as decoration. Fenders are low metal frames set in front of the fireplace to contain embers, soot and ash. For fireplace tending, tools include [[Fireplace poker|poker]]s, [[bellows]], [[tongs]], shovels, brushes and tool stands. Other wider accessories can include log baskets, companion sets, coal buckets, cabinet accessories and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.evansfireplaces.com/|title=Fireplaces Leicester Accessories|last=Jonathan|first=Admin|date=|website=Evans Fireplace Centre|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kochen \u00fcber offenem Feuer.JPG|thumb|Cooking over a fireplace]]\nAncient fire pits were sometimes built in the ground, within caves, or in the center of a hut or dwelling. Evidence of prehistoric, man-made fires exists on all five inhabited continents. The disadvantage of early indoor fire pits was that they produced toxic and/or irritating smoke inside the dwelling.\n\nFire pits developed into raised [[hearth]]s in buildings, but venting smoke depended on open windows or holes in roofs. The medieval [[great hall]] typically had a centrally located hearth, where an open fire burned with the smoke rising to the vent in the roof. [[Louver]]s were developed during the Middle Ages to allow the roof vents to be covered so rain and snow would not enter.\n\nAlso during the Middle Ages, [[Smoke canopy|smoke canopies]] were invented to prevent smoke from spreading through a room and vent it out through a wall or roof. These could be placed against stone walls, instead of taking up the middle of the room, and this allowed smaller rooms to be heated.\n\n[[Chimney]]s were invented in northern Europe in the 11th or 12th centuries and largely fixed the problem of fumes, more reliably venting smoke outside. They made it possible to give the fireplace a draft, and also made it possible to put fireplaces in multiple rooms in buildings conveniently. They did not come into general use immediately, however, as they were expensive to build and maintain.\n\nIn 1678, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], nephew of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], raised the grate of the fireplace, improving the airflow and venting system. The 18th century saw two important developments in the history of fireplaces. [[Benjamin Franklin]] developed a [[Franklin fireplace|convection chamber for the fireplace]] that greatly improved the efficiency of fireplaces and wood stoves. He also improved the airflow by pulling air from a basement and venting out a longer area at the top. In the later 18th century, [[Count Rumford]] designed a fireplace with a tall, shallow firebox that was better at drawing the smoke up and out of the building. The shallow design also improved greatly the amount of radiant heat projected into the room. Rumford's design is the foundation for modern fireplaces.\n\nThe Aesthetic movement of the 1870s and 1880s took on a more traditional spectra based on stone and deflected unnecessary ornamentation. Rather it relied on simple designs with little unnecessary ornamentation. In the 1890s the Aesthetic movement gave way to the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] movement, where the emphasis was still placed on providing quality stone. Stone fireplaces at this time were a symbol of prosperity, which to some degree is still the notion today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firecraft.co.uk/|title=Traditional Stone Fireplaces|last=Admin|first=Charlie|date=|website=Stone Fireplaces|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution of fireplace design===\n[[File:Sherlock Holmes Museum 001.jpg|thumb|[[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian style]] \"sitting room\" with a fireplace in the [[Sherlock Holmes Museum]], London]]\nOver time, the purpose of fireplaces has changed from one of necessity to one of visual interest.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zxORCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA627&dq=Over+time+the+design+of+fireplaces+has+changed+from+one+of+necessity+to+one+of+visual+interest#v=onepage&q=Over%20time%20the%20design%20of%20fireplaces%20has%20changed%20from%20one%20of%20necessity%20to%20one%20of%20visual%20interest&f=false|title=Architectural Graphic Standards|last=Architects|first=American Institute of|date=2016-03-21|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118909508|language=en}}</ref> Early ones were more fire pits than modern fireplaces. They were used for warmth on cold days and nights, as well as for cooking. They also served as a gathering place within the home. These fire pits were usually centered within a room, allowing more people to gather around it.\n\nMany flaws were found in early fireplace designs. Along with the Industrial Revolution, came large-scale housing developments, necessitating a standardization of fireplaces. The most renowned fireplace designers of this time were the Adam Brothers. They perfected a style of fireplace design that was used for generations. It was smaller, more brightly lit, with an emphasis on the quality of the materials used in their construction, instead of their size.\n\nBy the 1800s most new fireplaces were made up of two parts, the surround and the insert. The surround consisted of the mantelpiece and side supports, usually in wood, marble or granite. The insert was where the fire burned, and was constructed of cast iron often backed with decorative [[tiles]]. As well as providing heat, the fireplaces of the [[Victorian era]] were thought to add a cosy ambiance to homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fireplaceantiques.co.uk/Category/history-of-the-antique-fireplace/865|title=History of the Antique Fireplace|work=fireplaceantiques.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"160\" caption=\"Fireplace decors\">\nFile:Green dining_room - fireplace 01.jpg|Marble fireplace in the green dining room of [[Catherine Palace]].

Fireplace efficiency can also be increased with the use of a fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three Steps to a More Efficient Fireplace|url=http://fireplacemall.com/blog/2012/three-steps-to-a-more-efficient-fireplace/|date=2012-01-17}}</ref> Efficiency is a complicated concept though with open hearth fireplaces. Most efficiency tests consider just the effect of heating of the air. An open fireplace is not, and never was, intended to heat the air. A fireplace with a fireback is a radiant heater, and has done so since the 15th century. The best way to gauge the output of a fireplace is if you notice you're turning the thermostat up or down.\n\nMost older fireplaces have a relatively low efficiency rating. Standard, modern, wood-burning [[masonry heater|masonry fireplaces]] though have an efficiency rating of at least 80% (legal minimum requirement for example in Salzburg, Austria).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=LrSbg&Gesetzesnummer=20000675|title=RIS - Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift f\u00fcr Heizungsanlagen-Verordnung 2010 - Landesrecht Salzburg, Fassung vom 18.07.2015|work=bka.gv.at}}</ref> To improve efficiency,  fireplaces can also be modified by inserting special heavy fireboxes designed to burn much cleaner and can reach efficiencies as high as 80% in heating the air.  These modified fireplaces are often equipped with a large fire window, enabling an efficient heating process in two phases. During the first phase the initial heat is provided through a large glass window while the fire is burning. During this time the structure, built of refractory bricks, absorbs the heat. This heat is then evenly radiated for many hours during the second phase. Masonry fireplaces without a glass fire window only provide heat radiated from its surface. Depending on outside temperatures 1 to 2 daily firings are sufficient to ensure a constant room temperature.\n\n==Health effects==\n===Wood===\nA literature review published in the ''[[Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health]]'' concludes that there are a wide variety of health risks posed by residential wood combustion. It states:\n{{quote|With regard to adults, studies show that prolonged inhalation of [[wood smoke]] contributed to [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], chronic interstitial [[lung disease]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]] and [[corpulmonale]], and altered pulmonary immune defense mechanisms. While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC [Residential Wood Combustion] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary [[lung]] function in young [[asthmatics]]; increased incidence of acute [[bronchitis]] and severity/frequency of [[wheezing]] and [[coughing]]; and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute [[respiratory infections]].\n\nResidential wood combustion [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] also contain [[Lower sulfur oxides|sulfur oxides]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[carbon monoxide]] and potentially [[carcinogenic]] compounds including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]]. Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.<ref>Zelikoff, J.T., 2002. \"[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.5601&rep=rep1&type=pdf The Toxicology of Inhaled Woodsmoke]\". ''Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B'', 5:269-282</ref>}}\nThe [[Washington Department of Ecology]] also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and respiratory systems are unable to filter [[Particulates|particles emitted by wood combustion]], which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, cancer-causing chemicals can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with respiratory disorders are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children because it is associated with [[lower respiratory tract infection]]s.<ref name=Ecology>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/92046.pdf |title=Washington's Department of Ecology, \"Health Effects of Wood Smoke\", 1997, Retrieved February 3 2012 |access-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410042830/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/pubs/92046.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Home fireplaces have caused fatal [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/derek-kehler-and-helena-curic-identified-as-young-couple-killed-in-kurrajong-cabin-20150609-ghk7yb.html|title=Derek Kehler and Helena Curic identified as young couple killed in Kurrajong cabin|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2015-06-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gasses and ethanol===\n[[Propane]], [[butane]], and [[methane]] are all flammable gasses used in fireplaces ([[natural gas]] is mostly methane, [[liquefied petroleum gas]] mostly propane).

Due to the new members, the Parliament needed a larger hemicycle to hold debates, and more offices for [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]].

It is ultimately descended from the [[Proto-Italic language]].\n\nThe use of \"old\", \"early\" and \"archaic\" has been standard in publications of Old Latin writings since at least the 18th century.

In that period [[Cicero]], along with others, noted that the language he used every day, presumably the upper-class city Latin, included lexical items and phrases that were heirlooms from a previous time, which he called ''verborum vetustas prisca'',<ref>''De Oratoribus'', I.193.</ref> translated as \"the old age/time of language\".\n\nDuring the classical period, ''Prisca Latinitas'', ''Prisca Latina'' and other [[idiom]]s using the adjective always meant these remnants of a previous language, which, in the Roman philology, was taken to be much older in fact than it really was. ''Viri prisci'', \"old-time men\", were the population of [[Latium]] before the [[founding of Rome]].\n\n=== The four Latins of Isidore ===\nIn the [[Late Latin]] period, when Classical Latin was behind them, the Latin- and Greek-speaking grammarians were faced with multiple phases, or styles, within the language. [[Isidore of Seville]] reports a classification scheme that had come into existence in or before his time: \"the four Latins\" (\"Moreover, some people have said that there are four Latin languages\"; ''\"Latinas autem linguas quattuor esse quidam dixerunt\"'').<ref>Book IX.1.6.</ref> They were ''Prisca'', spoken before the founding of Rome, when [[Janus]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] ruled [[Latium]], to which he dated the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''; ''Latina'', dated from the time of king [[Latinus]], in which period he placed the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]]; ''Romana'', essentially equal to Classical Latin; and ''Mixta'', \"mixed\" Classical Latin and [[Vulgar Latin]], which is known today as [[Late Latin]]. The scheme persisted with little change for some thousand years after Isidore.\n\n=== Old Latin ===\nIn 1874, [[John Wordsworth]] used this definition: \"By Early Latin I understand Latin of the whole period of the Republic, which is separated very strikingly, both in tone and in outward form, from that of the Empire.\"{{sfn|Wordsworth|1874|p=v}}\n\nAlthough the differences are striking and can be easily identified by Latin readers, they are not such as to cause a language barrier. Latin speakers of the empire had no reported trouble understanding Old Latin, except for the few texts that must date from the time of the [[King of Rome|kings]], mainly songs. Thus, the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] from the early Republic were comprehensible, but the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', probably written under [[Numa Pompilius]], was not entirely clear (and remains thus).\n\nAn opinion concerning Old Latin, of a Roman man of letters in the middle Republic, survives: the historian, [[Polybius]],<ref>''Histories'' III.22.</ref> read \"the first treaty between Rome and Carthage\", which he says \"dates from the consulship of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and Marcus Horatius, the first consuls after the expulsion of the kings\". Knowledge of the early consuls is somewhat obscure, but Polybius also states that the treaty was formulated 28 years before [[Xerxes I]] crossed into Greece; that is, in 508  BC, about the time of the putative date of the founding of the Roman Republic. Polybius says of the language of the treaty \"the ancient Roman language differs so much from the modern that it can only be partially made out, and that after much application by the most intelligent men\".\n\nThere is no sharp distinction between Old Latin, as it was spoken for most of the Republic, and Classical Latin, but the earlier grades into the later. The end of the republic was too late a termination for compilers after Wordsworth; [[Charles Edwin Bennett]] said, \"'Early Latin' is necessarily a somewhat vague term ... Bell, ''De locativi in prisca Latinitate vi et usu'', Breslau, 1889,<ref>{{cite book|title=De Locativi in prisca latinitate vi et usu, dissertatio inauguralis philologica|first=Andreas|last=Bell|publisher=typis Grassi, Barthi et soc (W. Friedrich)|location=Breslau|year=1889}}</ref> sets the later limit at 75 BC. A definite date is really impossible, since archaic Latin does not terminate abruptly, but continues even down to imperial times.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1910|iii}} Bennett's own date of 100 BC did not prevail but rather Bell's 75 BC became the standard as expressed in the four-volume Loeb Library and other major compendia. Over the 377 years from 452 to 75 BC, Old Latin evolved from being partially comprehensible by classicists with study to being easily read by scholars.\n\n== Corpus ==\n[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|thumb|300px|The Praeneste Fibula, the earliest known specimen of the [[Latin]] language and dated to the first half of the seventh century BC.]]\n[[Image:Forum inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|The Forum inscription (''[[Lapis Niger]]'', \"black stone\"), one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions, from the 6th century BC; it is written [[boustrophedon]], albeit irregularly; from a rubbing by [[Domenico Comparetti]].]]\n\nOld Latin authored works began in the 3rd century BC. These are complete or nearly complete works under their own name surviving as manuscripts copied from other manuscripts in whatever script was current at the time. In addition are fragments of works quoted in other authors.\n\nNumerous inscriptions placed by various methods (painting, engraving, embossing) on their original media survive just as they were except for the ravages of time. Some of these were copied from other inscriptions. No inscription can be earlier than the introduction of the Greek alphabet into Italy but none survive from that early date. The imprecision of archaeological dating makes it impossible to assign a year to any one inscription, but the earliest survivals are probably from the 6th century BC. Some texts, however, that survive as fragments in the works of classical authors, had to have been composed earlier than the republic, in the time of the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]]. These are listed below.\n\n===Fragments and inscriptions===\nNotable Old Latin fragments with estimated dates include:\n\n* The [[Carmen Saliare]] (chant put forward in classical times as having been sung by the [[Salii|Salian brotherhood]] formed by [[Numa Pompilius]], approximate date 700 BC)\n* The [[Praeneste fibula]] (date from first half of the seventh century BC.)\n* The [[Lapis Niger#The inscription|Forum inscription]] (''see illustration'', c. 550 BC under the monarchy)\n* The [[Duenos Inscription|Duenos inscription]]  (c. 500 BC)\n* The [[Castor-Pollux dedication]] (c. 500 BC)\n* The [[Garigliano Bowl]]  (c. 500 BC)\n* The [[Lapis Satricanus]] (early 5th century BC)\n* The preserved fragments of the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] (traditionally, 449 BC, attested much later)\n* The [[Tibur pedestal]]  (c. 400 BC)\n* The [[Tomb of the Scipios#Sarcophagi and inscriptions|Scipionum Elogia]]\n** [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus#Epitaph on Sarcophagus|Epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] (c. 280 BC)\n** [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)#Epitaph|Epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)]]\n** [[Publius Cornelius Scipio P.f.

The writing conventions varied by time and place until classical conventions prevailed. The works of authors in manuscript form were copied over into the scripts current in those later times. The original writing does not survive.\n\n== Orthography ==\nSome differences between old and classical Latin were of spelling only; pronunciation is thought to be essentially the same as in classical Latin:<ref>{{cite book|year=1897|last=De Forest Allen|page=8|quote=There were no such names as ''Caius'', ''Cnaius''}}</ref>\n* Single for double consonants: ''Marcelus'' for ''Marcellus''\n* Double vowels for long vowels: ''aara'' for ''\u0101ra''\n* q for c before u: ''pequnia'' for ''pecunia''\n* c for g: ''Caius'' for ''Gaius''\n\nThese differences did not necessarily run concurrently with each other and were not universal; that is, c was used for both c and g.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{See also|History of Latin}}\n[[Image:Old latin diphthongs nochar.svg|200px|thumb|Diphthong changes from Old Latin (left) to Classical Latin (right)<ref>Allen (1897), p.6</ref>]]\n\n=== Stress ===\nOld Latin is thought to have had a strong stress on the first syllable of a word until about 250 BC. All syllables other than the first were unstressed and were subjected to greater amounts of phonological weakening. Starting around that year, the Classical Latin stress system began to develop. It passed through at least one intermediate stage, found in [[Plautus]], in which the stress occurred on the fourth last syllable in four-syllable words with all short syllables.\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs ===\nMost original PIE ([[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) diphthongs were preserved in stressed syllables, including {{IPA|/ai/}} (later ''ae''); {{IPA|/ei/}} (later ''\u012b''); {{IPA|/oi/}} (later ''\u016b'', or sometimes ''oe''); {{IPA|/ou/}} (from PIE {{IPA|/eu/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}}; later ''\u016b'').\n\nThe Old Latin diphthong ''ei'' evolves in stages: ''ei'' > ''\u1eb9\u0304'' > ''\u012b''. The intermediate sound ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was simply written ''e'' but must have been distinct from the normal long vowel ''\u0113'' because ''\u1eb9\u0304'' subsequently merged with ''\u012b'' while ''\u0113'' did not. It is generally thought that ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was a higher sound than ''e'' (e.g. perhaps {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} vs. {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} during the time when both sounds existed). Even after the original vowel {{IPA|/ei/}} had merged with ''\u012b'', the old spelling ''ei'' continued to be used for a while, with the result that ''ei'' came to stand for ''\u012b'' and began to be used in the spelling of original occurrences of ''\u012b'' that did not evolve from ''ei'' (e.g. in the genitive singular ''-\u012b'', which is always spelled ''-i'' in the oldest inscriptions but later on can be spelled either ''-i'' or ''-ei'').\n\nIn unstressed syllables, *oi and *ai had already merged into ''ei'' by historic times (except for one possible occurrence of ''poploe'' for ''popul\u012b'' \"people\" in a late manuscript of one of the early songs). This eventually evolved to ''\u012b'' according to the process described above.\n\nOld Latin often had different short vowels from Classical Latin, reflecting sound changes that had not yet taken place. For example, the very early [[Duenos inscription]] has the form ''duenos'' \"good\", later found as ''duonos'' and still later ''bonus''. A countervailing change ''wo'' > ''we'' occurred around 150 BC in certain contexts, and many earlier forms are found (e.g. earlier ''vot\u014d, voster, vorsus'' vs. later ''vet\u014d, vester, versus'').\n\nOld Latin frequently preserves original PIE thematic case endings ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-os]]'' and ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-om]]'' (later ''-us'' and ''-um'').\n\n===Consonants===\nIntervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[z]}}) was preserved up through 350 BC or so, at which point it changed into {{IPA|/r/}} (called [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]). This rhotacism had implications for declension: early classical Latin, ''honos'', ''honoris'' (from ''honos'', ''honoses''); later Classical (by [[Morphological leveling|analogy]]) ''honor'', ''honoris'' (\"honor\"). Some Old Latin texts preserve {{IPA|/s/}} in this position, such as the [[Carmen Arvale]]'s ''lases'' for ''[[lares]]''.  Later instances of single {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels are mostly due either to reduction of early {{IPA|/ss/}} after long vowels or diphthongs; borrowings; or late reconstructions.\n\nThere are many unreduced clusters, e.g. ''iouxmentom'' (later ''i\u016bmentum'', \"beast of burden\"); ''losna'' (later ''l\u016bna'', \"moon\") < *''lousna'' < */leuksn\u0101/; ''cosmis'' (later ''c\u014dmis'', \"courteous\"); ''stlocum'', acc. (later ''locum'', \"place\").\n\nEarly ''du'' {{IPA|/dw/}} becomes later ''b'': ''duenos'' > ''duonos'' > ''bonus'' \"good\"; ''duis'' > ''bis'' \"twice\"; ''duellom'' > ''bellum'' \"war\".\n\nFinal {{IPA|/d/}} occurred in ablatives, such as ''puell\u0101d'' \"from the girl\" or ''camp\u014dd'' \"from the field\", later ''puell\u0101'' and ''camp\u014d''. In verb conjugation, the third-person ending -''d'' later became -''t'', e.g. Old Latin ''faced'' > Classical ''facit.''\n\n==Morphology==\n===Nouns===\nLatin [[noun]]s are distinguished by [[grammatical case]], with a termination, or suffix, determining its use in the sentence: subject, predicate, etc. A case for a given word is formed by suffixing a case ending to a part of the word common to all its cases called a [[Word stem|stem]]. Stems are classified by their last letters as vowel or consonant. Vowel stems are formed by adding a suffix to a shorter and more ancient segment called a [[Root (linguistics)|root]]. Consonant stems are the root (roots end in consonants). The combination of the last letter of the stem and the case ending often results in an ending also called a case ending or termination. For example, the stem ''puella-'' receives a case ending ''-m'' to form the accusative case ''puellam'' in which the termination ''-am'' is evident.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Latin grammar|first=Charles Edwin |last=Bennett|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Chicago|year=1915|origyear=1895, 1908|page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Classical Latin]] textbooks the declensions are named from the letter ending the stem or First, Second, etc. to Fifth. A declension may be illustrated by a [[paradigm]], or listing of all the cases of a typical word. This method is less frequently applied to Old Latin, and with less validity. In contrast to Classical Latin, Old Latin reflects the evolution of the language from an unknown hypothetical ancestor spoken in [[Latium]]. The endings are multiple. Their use depends on time and locality. Any paradigm selected would be subject to these constraints and if applied to the language universally would result in false constructs, hypothetical words not attested in the Old Latin corpus. Nevertheless, the endings are illustrated below by quasi-classical paradigms. Alternative endings from different stages of development are given, but they may not be attested for the word of the paradigm. For example, in the Second Declension, *''campoe'' \"fields\" is unattested, but ''poploe'' \"peoples\" is attested.\n\nThe locative was a separate case in Old Latin but gradually became reduced in function, and the locative singular form eventually merged with the genitive singular by regular sound change. In the plural, the locative was captured by the ablative case in all Italic languages before Old Latin.<ref>{{cite book|page=204|title=A Grammar Of Oscan And Umbrian: With A Collection Of Inscriptions And A Glossary|first=Carl Darling|last=Buck|series=Languages of classical antiquity, vol. 5|location=Bristol, Pa.|publisher=Evolution Publishing|year=2005|origyear=1904}}</ref>\n\n====First declension (a)====\nThe 'A-Stem' declension.

It is ultimately descended from the [[Proto-Italic language]].\n\nThe use of \"old\", \"early\" and \"archaic\" has been standard in publications of Old Latin writings since at least the 18th century. The definition is not arbitrary, but the terms refer to writings with spelling conventions and word forms not generally found in works written under the [[Roman Empire]]. This article presents some of the major differences.\n\nThe earliest known specimen of the [[Latin]] language appears on the [[Praeneste fibula]].

In that period [[Cicero]], along with others, noted that the language he used every day, presumably the upper-class city Latin, included lexical items and phrases that were heirlooms from a previous time, which he called ''verborum vetustas prisca'',<ref>''De Oratoribus'', I.193.</ref> translated as \"the old age/time of language\".\n\nDuring the classical period, ''Prisca Latinitas'', ''Prisca Latina'' and other [[idiom]]s using the adjective always meant these remnants of a previous language, which, in the Roman philology, was taken to be much older in fact than it really was. ''Viri prisci'', \"old-time men\", were the population of [[Latium]] before the [[founding of Rome]].\n\n=== The four Latins of Isidore ===\nIn the [[Late Latin]] period, when Classical Latin was behind them, the Latin- and Greek-speaking grammarians were faced with multiple phases, or styles, within the language. [[Isidore of Seville]] reports a classification scheme that had come into existence in or before his time: \"the four Latins\" (\"Moreover, some people have said that there are four Latin languages\"; ''\"Latinas autem linguas quattuor esse quidam dixerunt\"'').<ref>Book IX.1.6.</ref> They were ''Prisca'', spoken before the founding of Rome, when [[Janus]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] ruled [[Latium]], to which he dated the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''; ''Latina'', dated from the time of king [[Latinus]], in which period he placed the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]]; ''Romana'', essentially equal to Classical Latin; and ''Mixta'', \"mixed\" Classical Latin and [[Vulgar Latin]], which is known today as [[Late Latin]]. The scheme persisted with little change for some thousand years after Isidore.\n\n=== Old Latin ===\nIn 1874, [[John Wordsworth]] used this definition: \"By Early Latin I understand Latin of the whole period of the Republic, which is separated very strikingly, both in tone and in outward form, from that of the Empire.\"{{sfn|Wordsworth|1874|p=v}}\n\nAlthough the differences are striking and can be easily identified by Latin readers, they are not such as to cause a language barrier. Latin speakers of the empire had no reported trouble understanding Old Latin, except for the few texts that must date from the time of the [[King of Rome|kings]], mainly songs. Thus, the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] from the early Republic were comprehensible, but the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', probably written under [[Numa Pompilius]], was not entirely clear (and remains thus).\n\nAn opinion concerning Old Latin, of a Roman man of letters in the middle Republic, survives: the historian, [[Polybius]],<ref>''Histories'' III.22.</ref> read \"the first treaty between Rome and Carthage\", which he says \"dates from the consulship of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and Marcus Horatius, the first consuls after the expulsion of the kings\". Knowledge of the early consuls is somewhat obscure, but Polybius also states that the treaty was formulated 28 years before [[Xerxes I]] crossed into Greece; that is, in 508  BC, about the time of the putative date of the founding of the Roman Republic. Polybius says of the language of the treaty \"the ancient Roman language differs so much from the modern that it can only be partially made out, and that after much application by the most intelligent men\".\n\nThere is no sharp distinction between Old Latin, as it was spoken for most of the Republic, and Classical Latin, but the earlier grades into the later. The end of the republic was too late a termination for compilers after Wordsworth; [[Charles Edwin Bennett]] said, \"'Early Latin' is necessarily a somewhat vague term ... Bell, ''De locativi in prisca Latinitate vi et usu'', Breslau, 1889,<ref>{{cite book|title=De Locativi in prisca latinitate vi et usu, dissertatio inauguralis philologica|first=Andreas|last=Bell|publisher=typis Grassi, Barthi et soc (W. Friedrich)|location=Breslau|year=1889}}</ref> sets the later limit at 75 BC. A definite date is really impossible, since archaic Latin does not terminate abruptly, but continues even down to imperial times.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1910|iii}} Bennett's own date of 100 BC did not prevail but rather Bell's 75 BC became the standard as expressed in the four-volume Loeb Library and other major compendia. Over the 377 years from 452 to 75 BC, Old Latin evolved from being partially comprehensible by classicists with study to being easily read by scholars.\n\n== Corpus ==\n[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|thumb|300px|The Praeneste Fibula, the earliest known specimen of the [[Latin]] language and dated to the first half of the seventh century BC.]]\n[[Image:Forum inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|The Forum inscription (''[[Lapis Niger]]'', \"black stone\"), one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions, from the 6th century BC; it is written [[boustrophedon]], albeit irregularly; from a rubbing by [[Domenico Comparetti]].]]\n\nOld Latin authored works began in the 3rd century BC. These are complete or nearly complete works under their own name surviving as manuscripts copied from other manuscripts in whatever script was current at the time. In addition are fragments of works quoted in other authors.\n\nNumerous inscriptions placed by various methods (painting, engraving, embossing) on their original media survive just as they were except for the ravages of time. Some of these were copied from other inscriptions. No inscription can be earlier than the introduction of the Greek alphabet into Italy but none survive from that early date. The imprecision of archaeological dating makes it impossible to assign a year to any one inscription, but the earliest survivals are probably from the 6th century BC. Some texts, however, that survive as fragments in the works of classical authors, had to have been composed earlier than the republic, in the time of the [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]]. These are listed below.\n\n===Fragments and inscriptions===\nNotable Old Latin fragments with estimated dates include:\n\n* The [[Carmen Saliare]] (chant put forward in classical times as having been sung by the [[Salii|Salian brotherhood]] formed by [[Numa Pompilius]], approximate date 700 BC)\n* The [[Praeneste fibula]] (date from first half of the seventh century BC.)\n* The [[Lapis Niger#The inscription|Forum inscription]] (''see illustration'', c. 550 BC under the monarchy)\n* The [[Duenos Inscription|Duenos inscription]]  (c. 500 BC)\n* The [[Castor-Pollux dedication]] (c. 500 BC)\n* The [[Garigliano Bowl]]  (c. 500 BC)\n* The [[Lapis Satricanus]] (early 5th century BC)\n* The preserved fragments of the laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] (traditionally, 449 BC, attested much later)\n* The [[Tibur pedestal]]  (c. 400 BC)\n* The [[Tomb of the Scipios#Sarcophagi and inscriptions|Scipionum Elogia]]\n** [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus#Epitaph on Sarcophagus|Epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] (c. 280 BC)\n** [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)#Epitaph|Epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)]]\n** [[Publius Cornelius Scipio P.f.

The writing conventions varied by time and place until classical conventions prevailed. The works of authors in manuscript form were copied over into the scripts current in those later times. The original writing does not survive.\n\n== Orthography ==\nSome differences between old and classical Latin were of spelling only; pronunciation is thought to be essentially the same as in classical Latin:<ref>{{cite book|year=1897|last=De Forest Allen|page=8|quote=There were no such names as ''Caius'', ''Cnaius''}}</ref>\n* Single for double consonants: ''Marcelus'' for ''Marcellus''\n* Double vowels for long vowels: ''aara'' for ''\u0101ra''\n* q for c before u: ''pequnia'' for ''pecunia''\n* c for g: ''Caius'' for ''Gaius''\n\nThese differences did not necessarily run concurrently with each other and were not universal; that is, c was used for both c and g.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{See also|History of Latin}}\n[[Image:Old latin diphthongs nochar.svg|200px|thumb|Diphthong changes from Old Latin (left) to Classical Latin (right)<ref>Allen (1897), p.6</ref>]]\n\n=== Stress ===\nOld Latin is thought to have had a strong stress on the first syllable of a word until about 250 BC. All syllables other than the first were unstressed and were subjected to greater amounts of phonological weakening. Starting around that year, the Classical Latin stress system began to develop. It passed through at least one intermediate stage, found in [[Plautus]], in which the stress occurred on the fourth last syllable in four-syllable words with all short syllables.\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs ===\nMost original PIE ([[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) diphthongs were preserved in stressed syllables, including {{IPA|/ai/}} (later ''ae''); {{IPA|/ei/}} (later ''\u012b''); {{IPA|/oi/}} (later ''\u016b'', or sometimes ''oe''); {{IPA|/ou/}} (from PIE {{IPA|/eu/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}}; later ''\u016b'').\n\nThe Old Latin diphthong ''ei'' evolves in stages: ''ei'' > ''\u1eb9\u0304'' > ''\u012b''. The intermediate sound ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was simply written ''e'' but must have been distinct from the normal long vowel ''\u0113'' because ''\u1eb9\u0304'' subsequently merged with ''\u012b'' while ''\u0113'' did not. It is generally thought that ''\u1eb9\u0304'' was a higher sound than ''e'' (e.g. perhaps {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} vs. {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}} during the time when both sounds existed). Even after the original vowel {{IPA|/ei/}} had merged with ''\u012b'', the old spelling ''ei'' continued to be used for a while, with the result that ''ei'' came to stand for ''\u012b'' and began to be used in the spelling of original occurrences of ''\u012b'' that did not evolve from ''ei'' (e.g. in the genitive singular ''-\u012b'', which is always spelled ''-i'' in the oldest inscriptions but later on can be spelled either ''-i'' or ''-ei'').\n\nIn unstressed syllables, *oi and *ai had already merged into ''ei'' by historic times (except for one possible occurrence of ''poploe'' for ''popul\u012b'' \"people\" in a late manuscript of one of the early songs). This eventually evolved to ''\u012b'' according to the process described above.\n\nOld Latin often had different short vowels from Classical Latin, reflecting sound changes that had not yet taken place. For example, the very early [[Duenos inscription]] has the form ''duenos'' \"good\", later found as ''duonos'' and still later ''bonus''. A countervailing change ''wo'' > ''we'' occurred around 150 BC in certain contexts, and many earlier forms are found (e.g. earlier ''vot\u014d, voster, vorsus'' vs. later ''vet\u014d, vester, versus'').\n\nOld Latin frequently preserves original PIE thematic case endings ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-os]]'' and ''[[Old Latin#Second declension .28b.29|-om]]'' (later ''-us'' and ''-um'').\n\n===Consonants===\nIntervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} (pronounced {{IPA|[z]}}) was preserved up through 350 BC or so, at which point it changed into {{IPA|/r/}} (called [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]). This rhotacism had implications for declension: early classical Latin, ''honos'', ''honoris'' (from ''honos'', ''honoses''); later Classical (by [[Morphological leveling|analogy]]) ''honor'', ''honoris'' (\"honor\"). Some Old Latin texts preserve {{IPA|/s/}} in this position, such as the [[Carmen Arvale]]'s ''lases'' for ''[[lares]]''.  Later instances of single {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels are mostly due either to reduction of early {{IPA|/ss/}} after long vowels or diphthongs; borrowings; or late reconstructions.\n\nThere are many unreduced clusters, e.g. ''iouxmentom'' (later ''i\u016bmentum'', \"beast of burden\"); ''losna'' (later ''l\u016bna'', \"moon\") < *''lousna'' < */leuksn\u0101/; ''cosmis'' (later ''c\u014dmis'', \"courteous\"); ''stlocum'', acc. (later ''locum'', \"place\").\n\nEarly ''du'' {{IPA|/dw/}} becomes later ''b'': ''duenos'' > ''duonos'' > ''bonus'' \"good\"; ''duis'' > ''bis'' \"twice\"; ''duellom'' > ''bellum'' \"war\".\n\nFinal {{IPA|/d/}} occurred in ablatives, such as ''puell\u0101d'' \"from the girl\" or ''camp\u014dd'' \"from the field\", later ''puell\u0101'' and ''camp\u014d''. In verb conjugation, the third-person ending -''d'' later became -''t'', e.g. Old Latin ''faced'' > Classical ''facit.''\n\n\n\n==Morphology==\n===Nouns===\nLatin [[noun]]s are distinguished by [[grammatical case]], with a termination, or suffix, determining its use in the sentence: subject, predicate, etc. A case for a given word is formed by suffixing a case ending to a part of the word common to all its cases called a [[Word stem|stem]]. Stems are classified by their last letters as vowel or consonant. Vowel stems are formed by adding a suffix to a shorter and more ancient segment called a [[Root (linguistics)|root]]. Consonant stems are the root (roots end in consonants). The combination of the last letter of the stem and the case ending often results in an ending also called a case ending or termination. For example, the stem ''puella-'' receives a case ending ''-m'' to form the accusative case ''puellam'' in which the termination ''-am'' is evident.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Latin grammar|first=Charles Edwin |last=Bennett|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, Chicago|year=1915|origyear=1895, 1908|page=12}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Classical Latin]] textbooks the declensions are named from the letter ending the stem or First, Second, etc. to Fifth. A declension may be illustrated by a [[paradigm]], or listing of all the cases of a typical word. This method is less frequently applied to Old Latin, and with less validity. In contrast to Classical Latin, Old Latin reflects the evolution of the language from an unknown hypothetical ancestor spoken in [[Latium]]. The endings are multiple. Their use depends on time and locality. Any paradigm selected would be subject to these constraints and if applied to the language universally would result in false constructs, hypothetical words not attested in the Old Latin corpus. Nevertheless, the endings are illustrated below by quasi-classical paradigms. Alternative endings from different stages of development are given, but they may not be attested for the word of the paradigm. For example, in the Second Declension, *''campoe'' \"fields\" is unattested, but ''poploe'' \"peoples\" is attested.\n\nThe locative was a separate case in Old Latin but gradually became reduced in function, and the locative singular form eventually merged with the genitive singular by regular sound change. In the plural, the locative was captured by the ablative case in all Italic languages before Old Latin.<ref>{{cite book|page=204|title=A Grammar Of Oscan And Umbrian: With A Collection Of Inscriptions And A Glossary|first=Carl Darling|last=Buck|series=Languages of classical antiquity, vol. 5|location=Bristol, Pa.|publisher=Evolution Publishing|year=2005|origyear=1904}}</ref>\n\n====First declension (a)====\nThe 'A-Stem' declension.

''populi Romanei'', \"of the Roman {{nowrap|people.\"<ref>Lindsay (1894), p. 383.</ref>}}, which both spellings in the same inscription.\n*Likewise, the sound change -os > -us and -\u014dm > -om > -um affect the nominative and accusative singular, and the genitive plural.\n*One very early text has genitive ''-osio'' (the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ending) rather than ''-\u012b'' (an ending appearing only in [[Italo-Celtic]]).{{citation needed|reason=If it is only one text then it probably is [[Lapis Satricanus]] which is \"in Old Latin or a closely related dialect\"|date=June 2017}}.

The squad is governed by the [[Mexican Football Federation]] and competes within [[CONCACAF]], the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football. It has won gold medals in the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]] and a silver medal in the [[Pan American Games]] team, as well as one silver and one bronze in the Women's World Cup prior to [[FIFA]]'s recognition of the women's game. When it placed second in 1971, Mexico hosted the second edition of this unofficial tournament. In addition to its senior team, Mexico fields U-20 and U-17 squads as well, with the latter having reached the final during the [[2018 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]].\n\nCoached by [[Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar]] for most of the team's official existence, ''La Tri's'' senior squad has participated in three [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cups]] and one edition of the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nThe senior squad was established in 1963, but its first FIFA-recognized game was in 1991.\n\n==History==\n===Unofficial era===\nAlthough not officially recognized by FIFA until 1991, Mexico's team was actually established in 1963, when many countries still had bans on women's football.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/06/16/costa-rica-womens-world-cup-las-ticas |title=Costa Rica women have history to draw on in first Women's World Cup |work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> In the 1950s, both [[Costa Rica]] and [[Argentina]] witnessed increased interest in the women's game and held tours in various countries. In 1963, [[Costa Rica women's national football team|''Las Ticas'']], the Costa Rican women's national football team, spent six months in Mexico conducting a tour to increase exposure of the game. Observing the success of ''Las Ticas'', Mexico formed its first team to play in opposition to the Costa Rican squad.\n\nLed by [[:es:Alicia Vargas|Alicia Vargas]], Mexico placed third in the [[1970 Women's World Cup]], a tournament FIFA has yet to acknowledge. Mexico fell 2-1 in the semifinal to hosts [[Italy women's national football team|Italy]] before defeating [[England women's national football team|England]] 3-2 in the third place match. The following year, Mexico hosted the [[1971 Women's World Cup]], which has also yet to be officially recognized. The squad reached the final but fell 3-0 to [[Denmark women's national football team|Denmark]]. An estimated 110,000 people attended the final at [[Estadio Azteca]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mundo-women71.html |title=Mundial (Women) 1971 |work=Rsssf.com |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> which is the largest crowd ever to witness a women's soccer game; FIFA has not recognized this attendance record either.\n\n===Modern era===\nIn the 1980s, when a series of [[Mundialito (women)|mundialitos]] took place, Mexico participated in the 1986 edition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garin|first=Erik|title=Mundialito (Women) 1981-1988|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mundialito-women.html/|accessdate=3 July 2019|newspaper=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Mexico was placed in Group A along with Italy and [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], but the team did not advance beyond the first stage.\n\nMexico's first official appearance in the Women's World Cup was in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]], when the [[United States]] hosted the tournament. The team also qualified in [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], hosted by [[Germany]] and [[Canada]], respectively. Likewise, the team qualified for the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2004]]. In all four instances, ''El Tri Femenil'' failed to advance beyond the group stage; in fact, the team has yet to win a single game in either major tournament.\n\nThe first official coach for the Mexico women's national football team was Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar. One of his first objectives was to qualify for the 1999 Women's World Cup.<ref name=\"Las Tri\">{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Michael|title=Mexico's Leonardo Cuellar Has Turned 'Las Tri' into a Global Power|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2012/01/21/leonardo-cuellar-has-turned-around-womens-soccer-in-mexico/|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=Fox News Latino|date=21 January 2012}}</ref> The team accomplished this by placing second to [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] in the [[1998 CONCACAF Women's Championship]]. However, much controversy arose regarding the nationalities of the recruited players. Preference was given to US-born players of Mexican heritage, largely because Mexico did not have an official league at the time. [[Andrea Rodebaugh]], the team's then-captain, argued that the team's main goal was to qualify; she also wanted to strengthen the team and celebrate its official recognition.<ref name=mex-am>{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Mike|title=Mexican Soccer Team Has American Accent Half Of The Improbable Women's World Cup Squad Comes From North Of The Border|url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-06-17/sports/25499647_1_andrea-rodebaugh-mexican-soccer-mexican-americans/2|accessdate=5 February 2012|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=17 June 1999}}</ref> Despite the controversy, the team went on to participate in the 1999 Women's World Cup with a mix of US-born and Mexican-born players.\n\nIn recent years, an increase in young talent developing in Mexico brought an increase of expectations from Mexican football fans and media alike. Following their worst ever [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup#Tournament ranking|World Cup finish]] in 2015, fans began calling for Cuellar's resignation or firing. In 2016, the women's national football team failed to qualify for the Olympics, and lost to [[Costa Rica women's national football team|Costa Rica]] which was the turning point in the team's history since many thought the defeat resulted in Mexico becoming the fourth best team in [[CONCACAF]]. With these results and [[Leonardo Cuellar]]'s controversial decision to not bring [[Charlyn Corral]] and [[Kenti Robles]], whom had terrific seasons at their clubs in Spain's [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n (women)|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], onto the squad<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/15204801/monica-gonzalez-urges-mexican-federation-seize-opportunity-promote-women-game|title=Monica Gonzalez urges Mexican federation to seize opportunity to promote women's game|work=espnW|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> led to him resigning from his position in April 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-mexican-women-s-soccer-coach-steps-down-20160406-story.html|title=Mexico's women's soccer coach Leonardo Cuellar steps down|last=Baxter|first=Kevin|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> [[Roberto Medina]] became the head coach in 2017.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nIn 2018 Mexico won the [[Football at the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games \u2013 Women's tournament|Central American and Caribbean Games]] by defeating [[Costa Rica women's national football team|Costa Rica]] 3-1 in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flashscore.com/football/north-central-america/central-american-caribbean-games-women/results/|title=Central American & Caribbean Games Women|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship]] Mexico entered as the third highest ranked team behind the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] and Canada. At the tournament Mexico finished third in their group with a record of one win and two losses, which included a surprising 2-0 loss to [[Panama women's national football team|Panama]]. As a result of not advancing to the knockout round, Mexico was unable to qualify for the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]] in [[France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concacaf.com/en/world-cup-qualifying-women/article/cwc-2018-panama-v-mexico-recap|title=Panama qualified for the semifinals of the 2018 Concacaf Women's Championship|accessdate=October 11, 2018|date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Notable matches===\nMexico's first recorded international game was against [[Austria women's national football team|Austria]] during the 1970 Women's World Cup, when squad beat the European side 9-0 in the group stage. However, to participate in this inaugural tournament, teams had to qualify, so ''La Tri'' played against other teams prior to this match.\n\nBefore the modern era, Mexico defeated England 2-1 in the third place match of the 1970 Women's World Cup, the first edition of the tournament. In front of a record-breaking crowd, the team also reached the final of the 1971 Women's World Cup, but fell 3-0 to Denmark.\n\nAmong the most notable victories is when the team finished second in the [[2010 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup]]. Hosts of the cup, Mexico defeated the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] in the semifinal for the first and only time before falling to [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] in the final.\n\n== Coaching staff ==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\nThe following players were called up for the [[2020 Cyprus Women's Cup]].<ref>https://miseleccion.mx/noticias/3085/Convocatoria-de-la-SNM-Femenil-para-la-Copa-Chipre-2020</ref>\n\n''Caps and goals as of 11 March 2020, after the match against {{fbw|CZE}}.''\n\n{{nat fs g start}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=1|pos=GK|name={{sortname|Cecilia|Santiago}}|age={{birth date and age|df=yes|1994|10|19}}|caps=64|goals=0|club=[[PSV Vrouwen|PSV Eindhoven]]|clubnat=NED}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=12|pos=GK|name={{sortname|Itzel|Gonz\u00e1lez}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1994|8|14}}|caps=3|goals=0|club=[[Club Tijuana (women)|Tijuana]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{National football squad break|background=#002a7e}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=2|pos=DF|name={{sortname|Kenti|Robles}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1991|2|15}}|caps=73|goals=3|club=[[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Femenino|Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]]|clubnat=ESP}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=3|pos=DF|name={{sortname|Arianna|Romero}}|age={{birth date and age|df=yes|1992|7|29}}|caps=47|goals=1|club=[[Perth Glory FC (W-League)|Perth Glory]]|clubnat=AUS}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=4|pos=DF|name={{sortname|Kimberly|Rodriguez}}|age={{birth date and age|df=yes|1999|3|26}}|caps=8|goals=1|club=[[Oklahoma State Cowboys and Cowgirls|Oklahoma State Cowgirls]]|clubnat=USA}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=5|pos=DF|name={{sortname|Jimena|L\u00f3pez}}|age={{birth date and age|df=yes|1999|1|30}}|caps=21|goals=2|club=[[Texas A&M Aggies women's soccer|Texas A&M Aggies]]|clubnat=USA}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=13|pos=DF|name={{sortname|Ana|Lozada}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1997|7|22}}|caps=1|goals=0|club=[[Club Am\u00e9rica (women)|Am\u00e9rica]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=15|pos=DF|name={{sortname|Monica|Flores}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1996|1|31}}|caps=11|goals=0|club=[[Valencia CF Femenino|Valencia]]|clubnat=ESP}}\n{{National football squad break|background=#002a7e}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=6|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Alexia|Delgado}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1999|12|9}}|caps=8|goals=0|club=[[Arizona State Sun Devils]]|clubnat=USA}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=7|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Mirelle|Arciniega}}|age={{birth date and age|df=yes|1992|8|13}}|caps=3|goals=1|club=[[Club Puebla (women)|Puebla]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=8|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Bri|Campos}}|age={{birth date and age|df=yes|1994|2|3}}|caps=4|goals=0|club=[[Ume\u00e5 IK|Ume\u00e5]]|clubnat=SWE}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=10|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Yamil\u00e9|Franco}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1992|7|7}}|caps=12|goals=1|club=[[Club Le\u00f3n (women)|Le\u00f3n]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=14|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Jennifer|Mu\u00f1oz}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1996|11|4}}|caps=2|goals=1|club=[[Club Am\u00e9rica (women)|Am\u00e9rica]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=16|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Amanda|P\u00e9rez|dab=footballer}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1994|7|31}}|caps=8|goals=0|club=[[Sporting CP (women's football)|Sporting CP]]|clubnat=Portugal}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=18|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Diana|Garc\u00eda|dab=footballer}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1999|11|11}}|caps=2|goals=0|club=[[Club Le\u00f3n (women)|Le\u00f3n]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{National football squad player (goals)|no=20|pos=MF|name={{sortname|Brenda|Le\u00f3n}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1993|9|8}}|caps=1|goals=0|club=[[Cruz Azul (women)|Cruz Azul]]|clubnat=MEX}}\n{{National football squad break|background=#002a7e}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=9|pos=FW|name={{sortname|Kiana|Palacios}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1996|10|1}}|caps=21|goals=2|club=[[Real Sociedad Femenino|Real Sociedad]]|clubnat=ESP}}\n{{nat fs g player|no=11|pos=FW|name={{sortname|Viridiana|Salazar}}|age={{Birth date and age|df=yes|1998|1|2}}|caps=2|goals=0|club=[[C.F.

Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez: As La Tri\u2019s first official coach between 1991 and 1998, Rodr\u00edguez took an inexperienced and under-resourced squad to the [[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship]] in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]]. Sending only one qualifier from the confederation to the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup]], this tournament fielded eight teams divided into two groups. Matches were also only 80 minutes long. In Group A, Mexico lost to eventual winner United States 12-0, its worst ever appearance. With a loss against [[Trinidad and Tobago women's national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and a win against [[Martinique women's national football team|Martinique]], Mexico finished third in the group, failing to advance to the semifinals. Likewise, during the [[1994 CONCACAF Women's Championship]], which determined the two qualifiers for the [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup]], Mexico finished in third place, failing to reach the international tournament yet again.\n\n2. [[Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar]]: Once a highly-touted player for the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico men\u2019s national football team]], Cu\u00e9llar took over El Tri Femenil after a brief stint as the women's soccer coach at [[California State University, Los Angeles|CSULA]]. Head coach until 2016\u2014a period of 18 years\u2014Cu\u00e9llar had a questionable record. As head coach, Mexico only qualified for the world cup on three occasions and the Olympics once; his teams never won a single game in any major tournament, nor did they finish first in the [[CONCACAF Women's Championship|CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup]]. Common criticism of his leadership was his [[nepotism]] and overreliance on US-born players. Cu\u00e9llar was never at risk of losing his job despite dubious results, and he even hired close allies, including his son [[Christopher Cu\u00e9llar]]. He also regularly held tryouts in the United States without doing the same in Mexico.\n\nInitially charged with taking the squad to the [[1998 CONCACAF Women's Championship]], which would award 1.5 qualification slots to the 1999 Women's World Cup, he was successful in qualifying for the team's first ever appearance at the official tournament. Finishing first in its group and winning against [[Guatemala women's national football team|Guatemala]] in the semifinal, Mexico eventually fell 1-0 to Canada in the final. Mexico went on to qualify for the cup after defeating [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina]] in the CONCACAF-CONMEBOL playoff match. Cu\u00e9llar was very lucky to qualify. The tournament expanded from 12 teams to 16 teams and the United States was the host, so their squad automatically qualified; had these two changes not been made, Mexico would have likely been out.\n\nCu\u00e9llar went on to schedule friendlies and participate in organized tournaments, but with few victories. The team qualified for [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], but his coaching style remained consistent. Frustration grew among his players after his call-ups involved much controversy. As players like [[Charlyn Corral]] and [[Kenti Robles]] demanded change, Cu\u00e9llar began to omit them from future squads. Likewise, he discriminated against [[Stephany Mayor]] and [[Bianca Sierra]] for being in a relationship, leading to their infrequent call-ups as well. His reign eventually ended when Mexico failed to qualify for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n3. [[Roberto Medina]]: Promoted from U-20 squad to the senior team without any official announcement from the [[Mexican Football Federation|FMF]], Medina served as head coach from 2016 to 2018. With few victories\u2014including a 3-0 win against [[Venezuela women's national football team|Venezuela]] early in his tenure, his technique was essentially a continuation of Cu\u00e9llar's style. Though he was praised after Mexico won the gold during the [[2018 Central American and Caribbean Games]], he was relieved of his position after failing to advance out of the group stage during the [[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship]]. With losses to [[Panama women's national football team|Panama]] and the United States, Mexico did not qualify for the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]] despite having the [[Liga MX Femenil]] and the most talented generation it had seen up until this point. Historically weaker teams, such as [[Jamaica women's national football team|Jamaica]] and Panama, advanced further than the squad, signifying that other teams had surpassed Mexico. After his ouster, he became head coach of [[Tigres UANL (Women)|Tigres]]. Medina had been the U-20 coach one other time, but elected to coach a men's team just before a world cup.\n\n4. [[Christopher Cu\u00e9llar]]: With no official announcement, Cu\u00e9llar Jr. replaced Medina after the team failed to qualify for 2019. Cu\u00e9llar, the son of [[Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar]], was promoted after serving as the U-20 women's squad coach. Like his predecessors, Cu\u00e9llar Jr. has had limited results. During the [[2019 Pan American Games]], La Tri finished in fifth place after failing to advance beyond the group stage despite the absence of both the United States and Canada. Throughout his first 21 games as DT, the team has had 6 victories, 5 draws, and 10 losses. Their best win has been against the [[Czech Republic women's national football team|Czech Republic]], ranked 28th in the world (with whom they've also tied), whereas their worst loss was against [[Paraguay women's national football team|Paraguay]], ranked 48th. Despite upcoming dates like the [[2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], Cu\u00e9llar Jr. was seen working with men's teams. #FueraCuellar has trended on twitter multiple times.\n\n==Domestic recognition==\nIn various occasions, fans have showed up in large numbers to support La Tri. When Mexico played against Denmark in the 1971 Women's World Cup final, over 100,000 showed up at Estadio Azteca. Likewise, when Mexico played Argentina in a playoff game to qualify for the 1999 Women's World Cup, over 70,000 fans were in attendance.\n\nUntil recently, attention around the women's team was dwarfed by the men's squad. Few matches were televised or advertised, limiting knowledge around the team's achievements and struggles. Former ESPN commentator [[Nelly Sim\u00f3n]] frequently advocated for more attention to this team. Likewise, after winning the gold medal at the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games, Kenti Robles called on news outlets and fans to pay more attention to them. However, with increased attention in the women's game after the establishment of the women's league in 2017, more games have been televised. Since then, millions watched Mexico play in the U-17 world cup final against [[Spain women's national football team|Spain]] in 2018.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Liga MX Femenil]]\n* [[Football in Mexico]]\n{{Portal bar|Women's association football|Mexico|Association football|Sports}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://www.femexfut.org.mx/ Official website]\n*[https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=mex/ FIFA profile]\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Mexico squads \u2013 FIFA Women's World Cup\n | bg        = #006847\n | fg        = white\n | bordercolor = #CE1126\n|list1=\n{{Mexico squad 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup}}\n{{Mexico squad 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup}}\n{{Mexico squad 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Mexico women's football squads \u2013 Summer Olympics\n | bg        = #006847\n | fg        = white\n | bordercolor = #CE1126\n|list1=\n{{Mexico women's football squad 2004 Summer Olympics}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Mexico at the FIFA Women's World Cup\n|list=\n{{1999 FIFA Women's World Cup finalists}}\n{{2011 FIFA Women's World Cup finalists}}\n{{2015 FIFA Women's World Cup finalists}}\n}}\n{{Football in Mexico}}\n{{CONCACAF women's teams}}\n{{National sports teams of Mexico}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mexico Women's National Football Team}}\n[[Category:North American women's national association football teams]]\n[[Category:Mexico women's national football team| ]]\n[[Category:Women's national sports teams of Mexico|Football]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox national football team\n| Names              = Mexico \n| Badge             = Mexico national football team seal.svg\n| Badge_size        = 200 px\n| Nickname          = <br />''El Tri Femenil''<br />''La Tri''\n| Association        = [[Mexican Football Federation|Federaci\u00f3n Mexicana de F\u00fatbol]]\n| Sub-confederation  = [[North American Football Union|NAFU]] (North America)\n| Confederation      = [[CONCACAF]] (North America, Central America and the Caribbean)\n| Coach              = [[Christopher Cu\u00e9llar]]\n| Captain            = [[Stephany Mayor]]\n| Most caps          = [[Maribel Dom\u00ednguez]] (112)\n| Top scorer         = [[Maribel Dom\u00ednguez]] (80)\n| FIFA Trigramme     = MEX\n| FIFA Rank          = {{FIFA Women's World Rankings|MEX}}\n| FIFA max           = 21\n| FIFA max date      = January 2011\n| FIFA min           = 31\n| FIFA min date      = December 2002\n|pattern_la1= _mexic18h\n|pattern_b1= _mexic18h\n|pattern_ra1= _mexic18h\n|pattern_sh1= _mexic18h\n|pattern_so1=_adidasfootball3whitestripes\n|leftarm1= 000000\n|body1= 16493E\n|rightarm1= 000000\n|shorts1= 000000\n|socks1= 990000\n|pattern_la2= _mex18a\n|pattern_b2= _mexic18a\n|pattern_ra2= _mex18a\n|pattern_sh2= _mexico18a\n|pattern_so2  = _adidasfootballmexico2018a\n|leftarm2= FFFFFF\n|body2= FFFFFF\n|rightarm2= FFFFFF\n|shorts2= FFFFFF\n|socks2= FFFFFF\n| First game         = {{fbw|MEX}} 9\u20130 {{fbw-rt|AUT}}<br>([[Jesolo]], [[Italy]]; 6 July 1970) |\n| Largest win        = {{fbw|MEX}} 10\u20130 {{fbw-rt|Malta}}<br>([[Bristol]], [[England]]; 28 June 1997)<br>{{fbw|MTQ|local}} 0\u201310 '''Mexico''' {{flagdeco|MEX}}<br>([[Bridgeview]], [[United States]]; 18 October 2014)\n| Largest loss       = {{fbw|USA}} 12\u20130 {{fbw-rt|MEX}} <br>([[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]]; 18 April 1991)|\n| World cup apps     = 3\n| World cup first    = 1999\n| World cup best     = Group Stage ([[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]], [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]], [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]])\n| Regional name      = [[CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup]]\n| Regional cup apps  = 7\n| Regional cup first = [[1991 CONCACAF's Women's Championship|1991]]\n| Regional cup best  = [[File:Silver medal icon.svg|14px]] Runners-up ([[1998 CONCACAF's Women's Championship|1998]], [[2010 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup|2010]])\n| Olympic apps       = 1\n| Olympic first      = 2004\n| Olympic best       = Quarterfinals ([[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]])\n| type=women\n| medaltemplates =\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Football at the Pan American Games|Pan American Games]]}}\n{{MedalSilver|[[1999 Pan American Games|1999 Winnipeg]]|[[Football at the 1999 Pan American Games \u2013 Women's tournament|Team]]}}\n{{MedalBronze|[[2003 Pan American Games|2003 Santo Domingo]]|[[Football at the 2003 Pan American Games \u2013 Women's tournament|Team]]}}\n{{MedalBronze|[[2011 Pan American Games|2011 Guadalajara]]|[[Football at the 2011 Pan American Games|Team]]}}\n|}}\n\nThe '''Mexico women's national football team''' represents [[Mexico]] on the international stage. The squad is governed by the [[Mexican Football Federation]] and competes within [[CONCACAF]], the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football. It has won gold medals in the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]] and a silver medal in the [[Pan American Games]] team, as well as one silver and one bronze in the Women's World Cup prior to [[FIFA]]'s recognition of the women's game. When it placed second in 1971, Mexico hosted the second edition of this unofficial tournament. In addition to its senior team, Mexico fields U-20 and U-17 squads as well, with the latter having reached the final during the [[2018 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]].\n\nCoached by [[Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar]] for most of the team's official existence, ''La Tri's'' senior squad has participated in three [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cups]] and one edition of the [[Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nThe senior squad was established in 1963, but its first FIFA-recognized game was in 1991.\n\n==History==\n===Unofficial era===\nAlthough not officially recognized by FIFA until 1991, Mexico's team was actually established in 1963, when many countries still had bans on women's football.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/06/16/costa-rica-womens-world-cup-las-ticas |title=Costa Rica women have history to draw on in first Women's World Cup |work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> In the 1950s, both [[Costa Rica]] and [[Argentina]] witnessed increased interest in the women's game and held tours in various countries. In 1963, [[Costa Rica women's national football team|''Las Ticas'']], the Costa Rican women's national football team, spent six months in Mexico conducting a tour to increase exposure of the game. Observing the success of ''Las Ticas'', Mexico formed its first team to play in opposition to the Costa Rican squad.\n\nLed by [[:es:Alicia Vargas|Alicia Vargas]], Mexico placed third in the [[1970 Women's World Cup]], a tournament FIFA has yet to acknowledge. Mexico fell 2-1 in the semifinal to hosts [[Italy women's national football team|Italy]] before defeating [[England women's national football team|England]] 3-2 in the third place match. The following year, Mexico hosted the [[1971 Women's World Cup]], which has also yet to be officially recognized. The squad reached the final but fell 3-0 to [[Denmark women's national football team|Denmark]]. An estimated 110,000 people attended the final at [[Estadio Azteca]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mundo-women71.html |title=Mundial (Women) 1971 |work=Rsssf.com |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> which is the largest crowd ever to witness a women's soccer game; FIFA has not recognized this attendance record either.\n\n===Modern era===\nIn the 1980s, when a series of [[Mundialito (women)|mundialitos]] took place, Mexico participated in the 1986 edition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garin|first=Erik|title=Mundialito (Women) 1981-1988|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mundialito-women.html/|accessdate=3 July 2019|newspaper=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Mexico was placed in Group A along with Italy and [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], but the team did not advance beyond the first stage.\n\nMexico's first official appearance in the Women's World Cup was in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]], when the [[United States]] hosted the tournament. The team also qualified in [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], hosted by [[Germany]] and [[Canada]], respectively. Likewise, the team qualified for the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2004]]. In all four instances, ''El Tri Femenil'' failed to advance beyond the group stage; in fact, the team has yet to win a single game in either major tournament.\n\nThe first official coach for the Mexico women's national football team was Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar.

However, much controversy arose regarding the nationalities of the recruited players. Preference was given to US-born players of Mexican heritage, largely because Mexico did not have an official league at the time. [[Andrea Rodebaugh]], the team's then-captain, argued that the team's main goal was to qualify; she also wanted to strengthen the team and celebrate its official recognition.<ref name=mex-am>{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Mike|title=Mexican Soccer Team Has American Accent Half Of The Improbable Women's World Cup Squad Comes From North Of The Border|url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-06-17/sports/25499647_1_andrea-rodebaugh-mexican-soccer-mexican-americans/2|accessdate=5 February 2012|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=17 June 1999}}</ref> Despite the controversy, the team went on to participate in the 1999 Women's World Cup with a mix of US-born and Mexican-born players.\n\nIn recent years, an increase in young talent developing in Mexico brought an increase of expectations from Mexican football fans and media alike. Following their worst ever [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup#Tournament ranking|World Cup finish]] in 2015, fans began calling for Cuellar's resignation or firing. In 2016, the women's national football team failed to qualify for the Olympics, and lost to [[Costa Rica women's national football team|Costa Rica]] which was the turning point in the teams history since many thought the defeat resulted in Mexico becoming the fourth best team in [[CONCACAF]].

Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez: As La Tri\u2019s first official coach between 1991 and 1998, Rodr\u00edguez took an inexperienced and under-resourced squad to the [[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship]] in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]]. Sending only one qualifier from the confederation to the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup]], this tournament fielded eight teams divided into two groups. Matches were also only 80 minutes long. In Group A, Mexico lost to eventual winner United States 12-0, its worst ever appearance. With a loss against [[Trinidad and Tobago women's national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and a win against [[Martinique women's national football team|Martinique]], Mexico finished third in the group, failing to advance to the semifinals. Likewise, during the [[1994 CONCACAF Women's Championship]], which determined the two qualifiers for the [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup]], Mexico finished in third place, failing to reach the international tournament yet again.\n\n2. [[Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar]]: Once a highly-touted player for the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico men\u2019s national football team]], Cu\u00e9llar took over El Tri Femenil after a brief stint as the women's soccer coach at [[California State University, Los Angeles|CSULA]]. Head coach until 2016\u2014a period of 18 years\u2014Cu\u00e9llar had a questionable record. As head coach, Mexico only qualified for the world cup on three occasions and the Olympics once; his teams never won a single game in any major tournament, nor did they finish first in the [[CONCACAF Women's Championship|CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup]]. Common criticism of his leadership was his [[nepotism]] and overreliance on US-born players. Cu\u00e9llar was never at risk of losing his job despite dubious results, and he even hired close allies, including his son [[Christopher Cu\u00e9llar]]. He also regularly held tryouts in the United States without doing the same in Mexico.\n\nInitially charged with taking the squad to the [[1998 CONCACAF Women's Championship]], which would award 1.5 qualification slots to the 1999 Women's World Cup, he was successful in qualifying for the team's first ever appearance at the official tournament. Finishing first in its group and winning against [[Guatemala women's national football team|Guatemala]] in the semifinal, Mexico eventually fell 1-0 to Canada in the final. Mexico went on to qualify for the cup after defeating [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina]] in the CONCACAF-CONMEBOL playoff match. Cu\u00e9llar was very lucky to qualify. The tournament expanded from 12 teams to 16 teams and the United States was the host, so their squad automatically qualified; had these two changes not been made, Mexico would have likely been out.\n\nCu\u00e9llar went on to schedule friendlies and participate in organized tournaments, but with few victories. The team qualified for [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], but his coaching style remained consistent. Frustration grew among his players after his call-ups involved much controversy. As players like [[Charlyn Corral]] and [[Kenti Robles]] demanded change, Cu\u00e9llar began to omit them from future squads. Likewise, he discriminated against [[Stephany Mayor]] and [[Bianca Sierra]] for being in a relationship, leading to their infrequent call-ups as well. His reign eventually ended when Mexico failed to qualify for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n3. [[Roberto Medina]]: Promoted from U-20 squad to the senior team without any official announcement from the [[Mexican Football Federation|FMF]], Medina served as head coach from 2016 to 2018. With few victories\u2014including a 3-0 win against [[Venezuela women's national football team|Venezuela]] early in his tenure, his technique was essentially a continuation of Cu\u00e9llar's style. Though he was praised after Mexico won the gold during the [[2018 Central American and Caribbean Games]], he was relieved of his position after failing to advance out of the group stage during the [[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship]]. With losses to [[Panama women's national football team|Panama]] and the United States, Mexico did not qualify for the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]] despite having the [[Liga MX Femenil]] and the most talented generation it had seen up until this point. Historically weaker teams, such as [[Jamaica women's national football team|Jamaica]] and Panama, advanced further than the squad, signifying that other teams had surpassed Mexico. After his ouster, he became head coach of [[Tigres UANL (Women)|Tigres]]. Medina had been the U-20 coach one other time, but elected to coach a men's team just before a world cup.\n\n4. [[Christopher Cu\u00e9llar]]: With no official announcement, Cu\u00e9llar Jr. replaced Medina after the team failed to qualify for 2019. Cu\u00e9llar, the son of [[Leonardo Cu\u00e9llar]], was promoted after serving as the U-20 women's squad coach. Like his predecessors, Cu\u00e9llar Jr. has had limited results. During the [[2019 Pan American Games]], La Tri finished in fifth place after failing to advance beyond the group stage despite the absence of both the United States and Canada. Throughout his first 21 games as DT, the team has had 6 victories, 5 draws, and 10 losses. Their best win has been against the [[Czech Republic women's national football team|Czech Republic]], ranked 28th in the world (with whom they've also tied), whereas their worst loss was against [[Paraguay women's national football team|Paraguay]], ranked 48th. Despite upcoming dates like the [[2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], Cu\u00e9llar Jr. was seen working with men's teams. #FueraCuellar has trended on twitter multiple times.\n\n==Domestic recognition==\nIn various occasions, fans have showed up in large numbers to support La Tri. When Mexico played against Denmark in the 1971 Women's World Cup final, over 100,000 showed up at Estadio Azteca. Likewise, when Mexico played Argentina in a playoff game to qualify for the 1999 Women's World Cup, over 70,000 fans were in attendance.\n\nUntil recently, attention around the women's team was dwarfed by the men's squad. Few matches were televised or advertised, limiting knowledge around the team's achievements and struggles. Former ESPN commentator [[Nelly Sim\u00f3n]] frequently advocated for more attention to this team. Likewise, after winning the gold medal at the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games, Kenti Robles called on news outlets and fans to pay more attention to them. However, with increased attention in the women's game after the establishment of the women's league in 2017, more games have been televised. Since then, millions watched Mexico play in the U-17 world cup final against [[Spain women's national football team|Spain]] in 2018.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Liga MX Femenil]]\n* [[Football in Mexico]]\n{{Portal bar|Women's association football|Mexico|Association football|Sports}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://www.femexfut.org.mx/ Official website]\n*[https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=mex/ FIFA profile]\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Mexico squads \u2013 FIFA Women's World Cup\n | bg        = #006847\n | fg        = white\n | bordercolor = #CE1126\n|list1=\n{{Mexico squad 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup}}\n{{Mexico squad 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup}}\n{{Mexico squad 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour\n|title=Mexico women's football squads \u2013 Summer Olympics\n | bg        = #006847\n | fg        = white\n | bordercolor = #CE1126\n|list1=\n{{Mexico women's football squad 2004 Summer Olympics}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Mexico at the FIFA Women's World Cup\n|list=\n{{1999 FIFA Women's World Cup finalists}}\n{{2011 FIFA Women's World Cup finalists}}\n{{2015 FIFA Women's World Cup finalists}}\n}}\n{{Football in Mexico}}\n{{CONCACAF women's teams}}\n{{National sports teams of Mexico}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mexico Women's National Football Team}}\n[[Category:North American women's national association football teams]]\n[[Category:Mexico women's national football team| ]]\n[[Category:Women's national sports teams of Mexico|Football]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: teams history \u2192 team's history", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_women%27s_national_football_team"}
