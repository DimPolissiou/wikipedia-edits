In its first decade of operation, Intercollege developed and modified courses of study in accordance with the college's growing constituencies, the needs of the Cypriot labor marke.\n\nTo this end, Intercollege prepared students for the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations, which were accepted by the University of the State of New York and the [[Thomas Edison State College]] towards their external degrees. Through hard work and persistence, the college has steadily developed into a respected Cypriot college that awards its own diplomas, bachelor's and master's degrees on three campuses. In September 2007, the 27-year-old college was acknowledged as a university and now uses the name University of Nicosia, Cyprus. The university continues to offer a number of professional programs such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Certified Accounting Technician (CAT), and the Chartered Institute of Banking.\n\n=== Important milestones ===\n[[Image:Intercollege logo.png|thumb|right|Intercollege's logo before achieving University status]]\n'''1980'''\n\nIntercollege of Management and Communication Studies (IMCS) was founded as a tertiary level institution offering the programs of various British professional bodies such as the Communication, Advertising and Marketing Foundation (CAM), the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) and the Association of Business Executives (ABE).\n\n'''1981'''\n\n* Nicos Peristianis is appointed director.\n* First international students join the college.\n* Internal certificates (after one year of study) and diplomas (after two years of study) are offered in programs such as business administration, hotel management, marketing, public relations, and advertising.\n\n'''1982'''\n\n* Sofronis Sofroniou joins the college as a lecturer and the first president of the college.\n* Tuition is provided for the University of the State of New York (USNY) external degrees through recognized external exams, such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Proficiency Examination Program (PEP), for which Intercollege becomes a testing center.\n* Intercollege moves to new, larger premises.\n\n'''1983'''\n\nIntroduction of internal bachelor's degree programs in majors such as hotel management, business administration, and liberal arts.\n\n* Computer science leading to internal qualification and the British professional program of IDPM (Institute of Data Processing Management) is introduced.\n\n'''1984'''\n\n* Intercollege students begin transferring to accredited universities: e.g. University of Maryland (Hotel Management), University of Strathclyde (postgraduate diploma in business administration).\n* The Thomas Edison State College external degree program is offered.\n* The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) program is introduced.\n\n'''1985'''\n\n* Andreas Polemitis, the present senior vice rector, joins Intercollege, merging his institute (which offered University of Indianapolis qualifications) with the college, leading to Intercollege's current structure.\n* University of Indianapolis programs in business administration and business data processing are introduced.\n* Professional training courses subsidised by the Industrial Training Authority are offered.\n* The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) British professional program begins.\n* The Secretarial Studies program is offered.\n\n'''1986'''\n\n* Travel and Tourism program, modelled on IATA and British Airways training programs, is introduced.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.

Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.<ref name=\"History\" /> In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in [[seed funding]], and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.<ref name=\"History\" /> After months at beta stage, the application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in [[Los Angeles]], Chris Peiffer, to develop a [[BlackBerry]] version, which arrived two months later.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nTo cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one.
