Originally released as an [[arcade game]] in 1989, it was the seventh title released for the [[CP System]] hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three characters: former pro wrestler and mayor [[Mike Haggar]], his daughter's boyfriend [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]], and Cody's best friend [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica.\n\nThe game began development as a sequel to the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of ''[[Double Dragon (video game)|Double Dragon]]''. ''Final Fight'' was ported to various home consoles such as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and was followed by a few sequels. Its development team later worked on the original ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and some of the characters from ''Final Fight'' later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise such as the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'' sub-series. In September 13, 2018, Capcom announced ''[[Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle]]'' with ''Final Fight'' being one of seven titles and released digitally for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] on September 18, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/09/capcom-beat-em-up-bundle-announced-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc|title=Capcom Beat \u2018Em Up Bundle announced for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC|last=Romano|first=Sal|date=13 September 2018|website=Gematsu|access-date=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Final Fight gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]] and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]] at the start of the game's first level]]\n\n''Final Fight'' can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: [[Mike Haggar|Haggar]], [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]], and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]]. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for ''Final Fight'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform jump attacks. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\n''Final Fight'' consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] unique to that round.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game is set in a fictional city on the Atlantic coast in the [[United States]] named Metro City. According to the game's intro, in 1990s (or 1989 in the Japanese version), the city's crime rate reached alarming levels. But since the election of pro wrestler turned politician [[Mike Haggar]] as the new Mayor, Metro City was changed and cleaned up drastically. Under his run, Haggar managed to suppress the crime rate of the city to its lowest points. While the citizens of Metro City were thankful for Haggar's hard work in curbing crime, one gang, the Mad Gears, would not go down so easily. Under the leadership of the crooked businessman, Belger, the group attempted to bribe Haggar with a large payoff to keep him from going after them, which Haggar refused. The Mad Gear responded by abducting his daughter, Jessica, and creating further unrest among the citizens of the city. When Haggar  found out about his daughter's abduction, he becomes furious, and decides to take his fight against Mad Gear to a personal level. Seeking additional manpower, Haggar recruits [[Cody Travers]], an expert fighter and Jessica's boyfriend, as well as [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], a ninja in training and Cody's good friend. Together, the three dedicate themselves to the complete eradication of the Mad Gear gang, as well as the safe rescue of Jessica from their clutches.\n\n''Final Fight'' consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] unique to that round.\n\nThe game gained notoriety for its morbid continue screen, where whatever character the player was using is shown tied to a chair with a bundle of dynamite on the table in front of him. In the 10 seconds the player has to insert another quarter, both Cody and Guy struggle to escape their bonds, while Haggar is feverishly blowing in a futile attempt to extinguish the lit fuse. If the player activates the continue option, a knife falls from the ceiling, disconnecting the fuse from the bomb.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! Stage\n! Description\n!

The title was changed to ''Final Fight'' before its official release after feedback from operators stating that the game was nothing like ''Street Fighter''.<ref name=capcomking />\n\nAccording to the developers, they were originally planning to have ''[[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]'' and ''[[Ken Masters]]'' from the original [[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]] as the main protagonists, but that idea was scrapped for a new plot and new settings. Instead, many elements from the game and its story were inspired by the 1984 film, ''[[Streets of Fire]]''. Many members of the production staff are fans of the movie. One of the main characters from the game, Cody, was even inspired by the hero of the film, Tom Cody, who was played by actor [[Michael Par\u00e9]]. The story of the movie also dealt with the kidnapping of an attractive young woman by a city gang.<ref name=\"Capcom_Classics_Collection\">{{cite video game| title = [[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Volume I]]| developer = [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]| publisher = Capcom| date=2005-09-27|accessdate=2011-03-12| level = Final Fight Design and History Extras}}</ref> The street gang the player faces in the game, the Mad Gear Gang, takes their name from a 1987 overhead racing game by Capcom of the same name.

Despite this, Sakaguchi is the only composer credited in the game (as \"Youkichan's Papa\"). The other six were confirmed as having worked on ''Final Fight'' in 2014 when the Clarice Disk imprint of City Connection released the ''Final Fight Original Sound Collection'', which featured the original soundtracks to the three original ''Final Fight'' games and its accompanying ports.<ref>http://vgmdb.net/album/48731</ref>\n\n==Home versions==\n\n===Super NES (''Final Fight'' and ''Final Fight Guy'')===\n[[File:Sid and Roxy in Final Fight.PNG|thumb|Roxy and [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] (first two from left), as depicted in the Japanese Super Famicom port, were replaced with Sid and Billy (third and fourth) in the international SNES versions of the game.]]\n\nA port of ''Final Fight'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] was released as a launch title for the platform in Japan in 1990 and later in [[North America]] in 1991 and then in the [[PAL region]] in 1992. It was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in 2007 and the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2013. The SNES port removed the two-player co-op option, the Industrial Area level, and playable character Guy. Most of the scene transitions were also edited out. In the arcade version, the player characters would be seen exiting the levels and breaking through doors unlike the SNES version. Due to hardware limitations the SNES version could only display two or three enemies on-screen, in contrast to the CPS arcade version, which could display up to nine or ten enemies on-screen; to make up for this difference, the SNES version features more stopping points than the arcade version and the enemy placement is vastly different.\n\nThe English localization of the SNES port was censored for its content and features several differences from its Japanese Super Famicom counterpart: the first two bosses, Damnd and Sodom, were renamed Thrasher and Katana respectively; Belger's wheelchair was redrawn to look like an office chair; Poison, a woman with pink hair, and Roxy, a woman with red hair,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Final Fight|developer=Capcom|platform=Super Famicom|language=Japanese|level=[http://www.videogameden.com/sfc/extra/fif.pdf Instruction manual, page 25]}}</ref> were replaced with two male enemies named Billy and Sid;<ref name=gameover_page225>{{cite book|title=Game Over|last=Sheff|first=David|authorlink=David Sheff|page=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/225 225]|quote=With Capcom USA, Phillips's team edited some of the grislier games that came in from its Japanese parent company, although Capcom's own censors weeded out the most offensive touches...

'What about the blonde named Roxy?' the American asked. The designer responded, 'Oh, you mean the transvestite!'

The original soundtrack was ported for the Super NES by Toshio Kajino (credited as \"Bull\").\n\nA revised edition of the SNES port, titled '''''Final Fight Guy''''', was released in Japan in 1992. This version replaced Cody with Guy as a selectable character (with a new opening and ending sequence explaining Cody's absence), included four difficulty settings, and added other new features such as two new [[power-up]]s, although the Industrial Area stage and the Two-Player mode were still omitted. An American version of the game (featuring the same changes in the localization as in the first game) was released in June 1994 as a rental-only game that was initially available at [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster stores]], although it was later given a limited release.<ref name=npv60p112>{{cite magazine|magazine=Nintendo Power|title=Pak Watch Update|page=112|issue=Volume 60|date=May 1994}}</ref> Kajino's music port was retained for that version.\n\n===U.S. Gold versions===\n[[U.S. Gold]] released ports of ''Final Fight'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] for the [[Europe]]an market in 1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February 1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the ''Super Fighter'' compilation with [[Pit Fighter]] and [[WWF WrestleMania (1991 video game)|WWF WrestleMania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/superfightercomp.htm |title=Super Fighter |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813035734/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/superfightercomp.htm |archivedate=2012-08-13 }}</ref>\n\n===X68000===\nThe [[Sharp X68000]] version was released by Capcom exclusively in Japan on July 17, 1992. This version is a relatively close conversion of the arcade game, with the only notable changes being different music (with a choice between a [[MIDI]] soundtrack and one using the X68000's internal sound chip) and a lower maximum on-screen enemies. The game came packaged with a CD soundtrack with all new remixed tunes.\n\n===Mega-CD/Sega CD (''Final Fight CD'')===\nThe Mega-CD/Sega CD version, titled ''Final Fight CD'', was ported and published by [[Sega]] under license from Capcom in 1993. This version retains nearly all the features of the arcade game that were removed in the two SNES ports (namely the two-player mode, the Industrial Area stage, and the ability to play as any of the three main characters) and adds [[voice acting]] to the game's opening and ending sequences, an [[arrangement|arranged]] version of the original soundtrack, and an exclusive time attack mode. However the maximum number of on-screen enemies were still lower than the arcade version and the combo attacks of Cody and Guy are much slower. Furthermore, the graphics suffered from a more limited color palette, as well as fewer background details. Like the SNES version, the Mega-CD version was censored for the English localization with many of the same changes. Poison and Roxy were kept, but were redrawn with less revealing clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com/FFsegaregional.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207201450/http://finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com/FFsegaregional.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-07|title=Final Fight CD regional differences - Final Fight Online|publisher=Finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com|accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>\n\n===Game Boy Advance (''Final Fight One'')===\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version that was developed by Sun-Tec, titled ''Final Fight One'', was released in 2001. ''Final Fight One'' features all three characters and the Industrial Area stage that was missing from the SNES version. The 2-player cooperative mode is also featured via [[Game Link Cable|link cable]]. Dialogue scenes prior to each boss battle have been added and the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'' renditions of Cody and Guy are featured as hidden playable characters. Other unlockable features include alternate palettes for each player character and the ability for two players to use the same character. The character and background designs are lifted from the SNES versions rather than the original arcade version, with the enemy placement being similar to ''Final Fight Guy'', although the maximum number of on-screen enemies was increased and all the transition sequences were restored. The same new power-up items introduced in ''Final Fight Guy'' are also present in this version, along with a new Cody doll item. The English localization of the game featured the same changes as the two SNES versions.\n\n===iOS===\nOn September 15, 2011, ''Final Fight'' was released into Apple's [[iTunes Store]]. This version includes all three characters from the Arcade version, a multiplayer feature that can only be used with Wi-Fi and a special items where one can turn on Extra Lives, Super Special, and Meat Explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-fight/id459663198?mt=8|title=Final Fight on itunes|publisher=Itunes.apple.com|accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>\n\n===''Capcom Classics Collection''===\n''Final Fight'' is included in the 2005 compilation ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and in the 2006 portable version ''Capcom Classics Collection Remixed'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is emulated from the original CP System arcade version and features very little differences from the arcade game. The compilation includes tips, character profiles, an art gallery and a sound test as bonus features.<ref name=\"Capcom_Classics_Collection\"/>\n\n===''Final Fight: Streetwise''===\nThe arcade version is also included as a hidden bonus game in the 2006 game ''[[Final Fight: Streetwise]]'' for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, the emulation in this version was programmed by [[Ultracade]], rather than [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] (the developers of ''Capcom Classics Collection'' series). The controls cannot be adjusted and the quality is lower than other emulated versions.\n\n===''Final Fight: Double Impact''===\nThe arcade version of ''Final Fight'' was released in a two-in-one bundle titled ''Final Fight: Double Impact'', alongside the arcade game ''[[Magic Sword (video game)|Magic Sword]]'', released digitally for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Added features include various graphic filters, including an arcade cabinet view, online drop-in multiplayer, an arranged soundtrack composed by [[Simon Viklund]], and extra content such as concept art, [[Street Fighter (UDON comics)|''Street Fighter'' comic]] pages featuring ''Final Fight'' characters, and the \"Final Fight\" episode of the [[Street Fighter (TV series)|''Street Fighter'' animated series]], which are unlocked by completing certain in-game challenges. The game was ported and developed by [[Proper Games]] and released for Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft points and April 15, 2010 for PlayStation Network for $9.99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/11/25/oh-my-car-capcom-porting-final-fight-and-magic-sword-to-xbla-a/|title=Joystiq - Capcom porting Final Fight and Magic Sword to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network|publisher=Joystiq.com|accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref> The PS3 version features a very restrictive [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] protection which circumvents the ability other PSN games have to be shared among several PSN accounts.

Originally released as an [[arcade game]] in 1989, it was the seventh title released for the [[CP System]] hardware. Set in the fictional Metro City, the player controls one of three characters: former pro wrestler and mayor [[Mike Haggar]], his daughter's boyfriend [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]], and Cody's best friend [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], as they set out to defeat the Mad Gear gang and rescue Haggar's young daughter Jessica.\n\nThe game began development as a sequel to the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of ''[[Double Dragon (video game)|Double Dragon]]''. ''Final Fight'' was ported to various home consoles such as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and was followed by a few sequels. Its development team later worked on the original ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and some of the characters from ''Final Fight'' later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise such as the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'' sub-series. In September 13, 2018, Capcom announced ''[[Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle]]'' with ''Final Fight'' being one of seven titles and released digitally for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] on September 18, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gematsu.com/2018/09/capcom-beat-em-up-bundle-announced-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc|title=Capcom Beat \u2018Em Up Bundle announced for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC|last=Romano|first=Sal|date=13 September 2018|website=Gematsu|access-date=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Final Fight gameplay.png|thumb|left|[[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]] and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]] at the start of the game's first level]]\n\n''Final Fight'' can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: [[Mike Haggar|Haggar]], [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]], and [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]]. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for ''Final Fight'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform jump attacks. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\n''Final Fight'' consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] unique to that round.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game is set in a fictional city on the Atlantic coast in the [[United States]] named Metro City. According to the game's intro, in 1990s (or 1989 in the Japanese version), the city's crime rate reached alarming levels. But since the election of pro wrestler turned politician [[Mike Haggar]] as the new Mayor, Metro City was changed and cleaned up drastically. Under his run, Haggar managed to suppress the crime rate of the city to its lowest points. While the citizens of Metro City were thankful for Haggar's hard work in curbing crime, one gang, the Mad Gears, would not go down so easily. Under the leadership of the crooked businessman, Belger, the group attempted to bribe Haggar with a large payoff to keep him from going after them, which Haggar refused. The Mad Gear responded by abducting his daughter, Jessica, and creating further unrest among the citizens of the city. When Haggar  found out about his daughter's abduction, he becomes furious, and decides to take his fight against Mad Gear to a personal level. Seeking additional manpower, Haggar recruits [[Cody Travers]], an expert fighter and Jessica's boyfriend, as well as [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], a ninja in training and Cody's good friend. Together, the three dedicate themselves to the complete eradication of the Mad Gear gang, as well as the safe rescue of Jessica from their clutches.\n\n''Final Fight'' consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a [[boss (video games)|boss character]] unique to that round.\n\nThe game gained notoriety for its morbid continue screen, where whatever character the player was using is shown tied to a chair with a bundle of dynamite on the table in front of him. In the 10 seconds the player has to insert another quarter, both Cody and Guy struggle to escape their bonds, while Haggar is feverishly blowing in a futile attempt to extinguish the lit fuse. If the player activates the continue option, a knife falls from the ceiling, disconnecting the fuse from the bomb.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! Stage\n! Description\n!

The title was changed to ''Final Fight'' before its official release after feedback from operators stating that the game was nothing like ''Street Fighter''.<ref name=capcomking />\n\nAccording to the developers, they were originally planning to have ''[[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]'' and ''[[Ken Masters]]'' from the original [[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]] as the main protagonists, but that idea was scrapped for a new plot and new settings. Instead, many elements from the game and its story were inspired by the 1984 film, ''[[Streets of Fire]]''. Many members of the production staff are fans of the movie. One of the main characters from the game, Cody, was even inspired by the hero of the film, Tom Cody, who was played by actor [[Michael Par\u00e9]]. The story of the movie also dealt with the kidnapping of an attractive young woman by a city gang.<ref name=\"Capcom_Classics_Collection\">{{cite video game| title = [[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Volume I]]| developer = [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]| publisher = Capcom| date=2005-09-27|accessdate=2011-03-12| level = Final Fight Design and History Extras}}</ref> The street gang the player faces in the game, the Mad Gear Gang, takes their name from a 1987 overhead racing game by Capcom of the same name.

Despite this, Sakaguchi is the only composer credited in the game (as \"Youkichan's Papa\"). The other six were confirmed as having worked on ''Final Fight'' in 2014 when the Clarice Disk imprint of City Connection released the ''Final Fight Original Sound Collection'', which featured the original soundtracks to the three original ''Final Fight'' games and its accompanying ports.<ref>http://vgmdb.net/album/48731</ref>\n\n==Home versions==\n\n===Super NES (''Final Fight'' and ''Final Fight Guy'')===\n[[File:Sid and Roxy in Final Fight.PNG|thumb|Roxy and [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] (first two from left), as depicted in the Japanese Super Famicom port, were replaced with Sid and Billy (third and fourth) in the international SNES versions of the game.]]\n\nA port of ''Final Fight'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] was released as a launch title for the platform in Japan in 1990 and later in [[North America]] in 1991 and then in the [[PAL region]] in 1992. It was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in 2007 and the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in 2013. The SNES port removed the two-player co-op option, the Industrial Area level, and playable character Guy. Most of the scene transitions were also edited out. In the arcade version, the player characters would be seen exiting the levels and breaking through doors unlike the SNES version. Due to hardware limitations the SNES version could only display two or three enemies on-screen, in contrast to the CPS arcade version, which could display up to nine or ten enemies on-screen; to make up for this difference, the SNES version features more stopping points than the arcade version and the enemy placement is vastly different.\n\nThe English localization of the SNES port was censored for its content and features several differences from its Japanese Super Famicom counterpart: the first two bosses, Damnd and Sodom, were renamed Thrasher and Katana respectively; Belger's wheelchair was redrawn to look like an office chair; Poison, a woman with pink hair, and Roxy, a woman with red hair,<ref>{{cite video game|title=Final Fight|developer=Capcom|platform=Super Famicom|language=Japanese|level=[http://www.videogameden.com/sfc/extra/fif.pdf Instruction manual, page 25]}}</ref> were replaced with two male enemies named Billy and Sid;<ref name=gameover_page225>{{cite book|title=Game Over|last=Sheff|first=David|authorlink=David Sheff|page=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/225 225]|quote=With Capcom USA, Phillips's team edited some of the grislier games that came in from its Japanese parent company, although Capcom's own censors weeded out the most offensive touches...

The original soundtrack was ported for the Super NES by Toshio Kajino (credited as \"Bull\").\n\nA revised edition of the SNES port, titled '''''Final Fight Guy''''', was released in Japan in 1992. This version replaced Cody with Guy as a selectable character (with a new opening and ending sequence explaining Cody's absence), included four difficulty settings, and added other new features such as two new [[power-up]]s, although the Industrial Area stage and the Two-Player mode were still omitted. An American version of the game (featuring the same changes in the localization as in the first game) was released in June 1994 as a rental-only game that was initially available at [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster stores]], although it was later given a limited release.<ref name=npv60p112>{{cite magazine|magazine=Nintendo Power|title=Pak Watch Update|page=112|issue=Volume 60|date=May 1994}}</ref> Kajino's music port was retained for that version.\n\n===U.S. Gold versions===\n[[U.S. Gold]] released ports of ''Final Fight'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] for the [[Europe]]an market in 1991. These ports were developed by Creative Materials. In February 1993, the ZX Spectrum version was released as part of the ''Super Fighter'' compilation with [[Pit Fighter]] and [[WWF WrestleMania (1991 video game)|WWF WrestleMania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/superfightercomp.htm |title=Super Fighter |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-11-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813035734/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/superfightercomp.htm |archivedate=2012-08-13 }}</ref>\n\n===X68000===\nThe [[Sharp X68000]] version was released by Capcom exclusively in Japan on July 17, 1992. This version is a relatively close conversion of the arcade game, with the only notable changes being different music (with a choice between a [[MIDI]] soundtrack and one using the X68000's internal sound chip) and a lower maximum on-screen enemies. The game came packaged with a CD soundtrack with all new remixed tunes.\n\n===Mega-CD/Sega CD (''Final Fight CD'')===\nThe Mega-CD/Sega CD version, titled ''Final Fight CD'', was ported and published by [[Sega]] under license from Capcom in 1993. This version retains nearly all the features of the arcade game that were removed in the two SNES ports (namely the two-player mode, the Industrial Area stage, and the ability to play as any of the three main characters) and adds [[voice acting]] to the game's opening and ending sequences, an [[arrangement|arranged]] version of the original soundtrack, and an exclusive time attack mode. However the maximum number of on-screen enemies were still lower than the arcade version and the combo attacks of Cody and Guy are much slower. Furthermore, the graphics suffered from a more limited color palette, as well as fewer background details. Like the SNES version, the Mega-CD version was censored for the English localization with many of the same changes. Poison and Roxy were kept, but were redrawn with less revealing clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com/FFsegaregional.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207201450/http://finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com/FFsegaregional.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-02-07|title=Final Fight CD regional differences - Final Fight Online|publisher=Finalfight.classicgaming.gamespy.com|accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>\n\n===Game Boy Advance (''Final Fight One'')===\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version that was developed by Sun-Tec, titled ''Final Fight One'', was released in 2001. ''Final Fight One'' features all three characters and the Industrial Area stage that was missing from the SNES version. The 2-player cooperative mode is also featured via [[Game Link Cable|link cable]]. Dialogue scenes prior to each boss battle have been added and the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'' renditions of Cody and Guy are featured as hidden playable characters. Other unlockable features include alternate palettes for each player character and the ability for two players to use the same character. The character and background designs are lifted from the SNES versions rather than the original arcade version, with the enemy placement being similar to ''Final Fight Guy'', although the maximum number of on-screen enemies was increased and all the transition sequences were restored. The same new power-up items introduced in ''Final Fight Guy'' are also present in this version, along with a new Cody doll item. The English localization of the game featured the same changes as the two SNES versions.\n\n===iOS===\nOn September 15, 2011, ''Final Fight'' was released into Apple's [[iTunes Store]]. This version includes all three characters from the Arcade version, a multiplayer feature that can only be used with Wi-Fi and a special items where one can turn on Extra Lives, Super Special, and Meat Explosion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-fight/id459663198?mt=8|title=Final Fight on itunes|publisher=Itunes.apple.com|accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>\n\n===''Capcom Classics Collection''===\n''Final Fight'' is included in the 2005 compilation ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Volume 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and in the 2006 portable version ''Capcom Classics Collection Remixed'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game is emulated from the original CP System arcade version and features very little differences from the arcade game. The compilation includes tips, character profiles, an art gallery and a sound test as bonus features.<ref name=\"Capcom_Classics_Collection\"/>\n\n===''Final Fight: Streetwise''===\nThe arcade version is also included as a hidden bonus game in the 2006 game ''[[Final Fight: Streetwise]]'' for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, the emulation in this version was programmed by [[Ultracade]], rather than [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]] (the developers of ''Capcom Classics Collection'' series).

Washington's mother is quoted as saying, \"Raymond was a good kid when he was a boy. Raymond didn't go out of his way to fight or do anything bad, but if someone came to him, he would protect himself. And he was well built. He tried to protect the community and keep the bad guys out.

Raymond was a bully. A muscular bully. He wouldn't let anybody from outside our neighborhood bother us. He would bother us. Raymond could be very mean.\"<ref name=laweekly.com/> A friend stated that Washington was a good [[American football|football]] player, but never participated as a member of school sports team due to his poor grades. Washington was repeatedly [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from schools resulting in frequent transfers, attending [[Locke High School]], [[John C. Fremont High School]], an [[alternative school]] attached to [[Washington Preparatory High School]], and [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] near [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].\n\nHe was also the one that killed Steven Mathews a man that stole his car.No one knew that until a rival gang member snitched on him.\n\n===Gang involvement===\nIn the late 1960s, there was an increase in [[Juvenile delinquency|youth crime]] in Los Angeles, particularly in and around South Central's [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood. Crime was especially prevalent in the three [[public housing|housing projects]] located in Watts, known as \"the Bricks\": [[Imperial Courts]], [[Nickerson Gardens]], and [[Jordan Downs]], where violent street [[robbery|robberies]] were common among adolescent criminals. Older [[African Americans|African-American]] street [[gang]]s in South Central like the Slausons, the Businessmen, and the Gladiators, had been ended by activist groups such as the [[Black Panther Party]] and the [[US Organization]]. The absence of the old gangs saw numerous new youth gangs begin to form in their place, including the Sportsmans Park, New House Boys, Acey Duecy, and Chain Gang, on West Side.\n\nWashington, a native of the East Side in his early teens during the rise of the gangs, joined a local street gang called The Avenues, led by another teenager named Craig Munson. At age 15, Washington beat up Munson's younger brother in fist fight after discovering Munson had put a gun to his older brother, Reggie Washington. After the fight, Washington and one of his other older brothers, Ronald Joe, confronted Munson on the corner of E 81st Street and Avalon Boulevard. According to former gang members who knew Washington at the time, he was subsequently beaten up by Craig Munson in retaliation for his younger brother's beating, and Washington left The Avenues. In late 1969, Washington organized his own gang called the Baby Avenues, recruiting a group of other neighborhood youths in South Central. The Baby Avenues wanted to emulate a gang of older youths called The Avenue Boys, which had been active since 1964 on Central Avenue.\n\n\n====Unification of South Central gangs====\nIn 1971, Washington approached [[Stanley Williams|Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams]], a similar gang leader from South Central's West Side who used his reputation as a fist fighter to unite gangs under his control, at Washington Preparatory High School where both were attending. Washington had heard of Williams through a mutual friend, who had informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs such as the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang. According to Williams' account of the meeting, what struck him about Washington was that, besides being incredibly muscular, he and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique, wearing leather jackets with starched [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] jeans and suspenders. Washington proposed to Williams they form a [[confederation]] of the gangs under their influence in their respective areas along with another teenage gang leader called Mac Thomas in [[Compton, California|Compton]], to form a single large street gang. The proposal would see Williams' gangs adopt the Crip branding and would be allied with other Crip gangs outside of the West Side, but would retain ultimate leadership in the East Side. Williams accepted Washington's proposal, uniting the West Side gangs under his influence as the West Side Crips.\n\nThe Crips quickly established themselves as the largest street gang in Los Angeles, with increasing numbers and territory as their influence spread across low-income black neighborhoods. Washington, Williams and Thomas effectively held a [[monopoly]] on criminal activity in these areas, and became the dominant [[Boss (crime)|crime bosses]]. Street gangs that had resisted being absorbed into the Crips soon formed their own confederate alliance, the [[Bloods]], to protect their independence and their interests in the criminal market. The founding of the Bloods sparked an instant rivalry between the new large gangs that saw a surge in [[violent crime]] in Los Angeles, as neighboring Crip and Blood sets began using increasing violence to fight over territory and personal feuds. With the rise of [[News media in the United States|media]] coverage, which put these new violent gangs on the [[Newspaper|front page]], soon many disaffected black youths were running to join the Crips, many without ever being contacted by gang leaders. One story at the time stated:<ref name=lycos.com>{{cite web|title=Crips |publisher=Lycos.com |url=http://lycos.com/info/crips.html |accessdate=2008-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228085102/http://www.lycos.com/info/crips.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One of the gangs,  in the area is known as the Crips/ which started out at Washington High School as an [[extortion]] and [[terrorism|terror]] organization and spread to other schools where the gang members enrolled after being expelled from Washington, the police said.\n\nThe Police also said that this gang has been spreading \"like an octopus\" and now has members throughout South-Central Los Angeles, [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], Compton, [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], the Firestone [unincorporated] area and the [[San Fernando Valley]].\n\nGang members, to identify themselves, wear black gloves on their left hands and gold-colored earrings in their left ears, which are pierced, according to police. They sometimes carry [[Walking stick|canes]], which they use as [[weapon]]s.\n\nThere are two stories circulating on the derivation of the word Crips. One is that it stands for a cripple, because some of the founders were injured and had to carry canes for a time. The other is that the founders once wore [[Afro]]-style hairdos and their parents made them \"crip it.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}\n\nWithin a few years, much of the original Crip leadership were either imprisoned or dead. On February 23, 1973, Curtis \"Buddha\" Morrow, a close friend of Tookie Williams and a high-ranking Crip [[Mob enforcer|enforcer]], was shot to death in South Central following a petty argument. Mac Thomas was murdered under mysterious circumstances in the mid-1970s.\n\n==Robbery conviction==\nIn 1974, 21-year-old Washington was arrested for second-degree [[robbery]] and sentenced to five years' imprisonment at the [[Deuel Vocational Institution]] in [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], becoming the first Crip to be incarcerated there. Washington was unpopular among the prison population as he began to recruit young African-American inmates into the Crips, much to the disapproval of established black [[Prison gang|prison groups]] like the Black Muslims and the [[Black Guerrilla Family]]. According to a former inmate who was housed at Deuel with Washington, the Black Muslims and the Black Guerrilla Family were aware of the spread of the Crips in Los Angeles, and warned Washington that they would not tolerate the formation of Crips in the prison. Washington faced another problem while serving time at Deuel: as the Crips murdered rival gang members on the streets of Los Angeles, inmates at Deuel who were relatives of victims held Washington responsible for their deaths. Greg \"Batman\" Davis, a friend of Washington and an original Crips member, stated \"People in the prisons was losing their loved ones on the streets and because Raymond was the founder of the Crips, they blamed him for it. And since Raymond was the only Crip up there (at Deuel) at the time, they were trying to kill him.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1976, Washington paroled from prison and returned to Los Angeles. Reportedly, Washington was shocked to discover that the violent war between the Crips, Bloods, and [[Gangs in the United States|Hispanic gangs]] had escalated to the point that fighting using [[firearms]], as opposed to fist fighting, was now normal. Over the next few months, Washington became disillusioned with the Crips as the gang committed more violent and senseless crimes, with new recruits seeking to build their reputations.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since Washington's imprisonment, the organization had totally broken down into loosely-affiliated [[Decentralization|decentralized]] sets that often fought each other, as the Crips' original leadership had disappeared. Tookie Williams, the last remaining original Crips leader, served as the ''[[de facto]]'' leader during Washington's imprisonment. Williams had been injured in a [[drive-by shooting]] in 1976, and developed a growing addiction to [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] that caused his authority to wane until he was arrested for four counts of [[homicide]] shortly before Washington was murdered. According to [[law enforcement]], former gang members and close friends, Washington had decided that the Crips needed to be brought back under one [[umbrella organization]] to stop infighting, and then to work towards a [[truce]] with the Bloods.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Upon realizing he no longer held influence in the gang, Washington started to distance himself from the Crips.\n\n==Death==\nAt around 10:00 p.m. on August 9, 1979, twenty-five-year-old Washington was murdered in a [[drive-by shooting]] on the corner of E 64th Street and S San Pedro Street in South Central Los Angeles, and was rushed to [[Morningside Hospital (California)|Morningside Hospital]] where he died while undergoing emergency surgery.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} No suspects have been arrested, and Washington's murder remains unsolved. It was reported that Washington was hanging out on the corner when a car pulled up and the unidentified occupants called him over to the car. Washington's associates, as well as the police, were aware he would never walk up to cars of people that he did not know, and most likely knew the occupants of the vehicle as he told an acquaintance that he knew them. Washington engaged in a brief conversation with them before the occupant in the passenger seat drew a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and shot him in the [[abdomen]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Washington, Raymond}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:1979 murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:American criminals]]\n[[Category:Gang members]]\n[[Category:Crips]]\n[[Category:Criminals of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:History of Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Murdered African-American people]]\n[[Category:People murdered by African-American organized crime]]\n[[Category:Racism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Unsolved murders in the United States]]\n[[Category:People murdered in California]]\n[[Category:Deaths by firearm in California]]\n[[Category:American murder victims]]\n[[Category:John C.

Set in the early 20th century, the player controls a forest ranger who must protect the local wildlife from a group of evil poachers who are driving the animals to extinction. A home version was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] (Mega Drive) on November 1991. It was also included in the arcade game compilation ''[[Taito Legends 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\n==Gameplay== \n[[image:Growl Arcade.png|thumb|left|The first stage in the arcade version]]\n\nThe player begins the game by choosing from one of four different forest rangers, each with a different amount of health, attack strength, and jumping height. There are four variations of the game (which can be determined by dipswitch settings):\n\n* A common two-player setting (used in most 2 player cabinets).\n* A four-player setting with individual coin slots for each player (usually seen in most conversions of 4-player cabinets such as Crime Fighters, Gauntlet, and Quartet).\n* A four-player setting which uses a pair of two player cabinets linked together with a special cable.\n* A four-player setting which uses two coin slots for everyone (usually seen in conversions of Trog among other four player cabinets which use two coin slots).\n \nThe two-player variant allows the player to choose which character they would like to play as while the four-player versions assign each character to a player slot like other beat em ups.\n\nThe game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character and two action buttons (attack and jump). The player can perform a variety of different attacks (punches, kicks, and finishing blows) depending on the position of an enemy. By pressing both buttons while surrounded by enemies, the player can perform a special attack that strikes every enemy around him. By pressing both buttons while holding the joystick upwards, the player will perform a longer jump.\n\nThe player can procure weapons by destroying barrels and wooden crates or disarming certain enemies. There are a total of eight weapons which can be obtained: three melee weapons (a pipe, a sword and a whip), two throwing weapons (knives and hand grenades), and three firearms (a revolver, an M-16 Assault Rifle, and a 4 barreled FLASH-style rocket launcher). The barrels and crates can be picked up and thrown at enemies as well. When the assault rifle or rocket launcher runs out of ammunition, these are still wielded by the player as melee weapons. The revolver, on the other hand, is thrown by the player after all of its bullets are used. The player can drop his current weapon by pressing down and attack while wielding it. If a weapon lies on the ground after a certain period, it will vanish completely.\n\nThere are seven regular stages (called rounds) and a bonus game, for a total of eight stages. The locations include a city, a moving train, a boat, a jungle, a cavern, and the hideout of the poachers. There are six types of enemy characters throughout the game, excluding the final boss (who has two forms). There are also animal helpers that will help out the player after they're rescued from a poacher, such as an eagle, a herd of deer, and an elephant.\n\n==Home versions==\n===Sega Genesis===\nThe Sega Genesis port of ''Growl'' can only be played by a single player, although all four characters are present and are given individual names (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack). The controls are identical to the arcade version. The player's special attacks can now be performed at any time, but now they drain a bit of the player's health. Instead of recovering health between stages, the player recovers his health by picking up apples hidden inside certain crates. The cavern stage was also redesigned completely. Finally the M-16 assault rifle has been replaced with an AK-47\n\n===''Taito Legends 2''===\nAlthough the version in ''Taito Legends 2'' is an emulation of the arcade game, the game was altered to remove the body parts that fly into the air whenever an enemy is killed during an explosion caused by exploding barrels, hand grenades, or rocket launcher blasts.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{KLOV game|id=8017}}\n*[http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=growl&page=detail&id=1022 arcade-history]\n\n[[Category:1990 video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Side-scrolling beat 'em ups]]\n[[Category:Cooperative video games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Taito beat 'em ups]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Yasuhisa Watanabe]]\n", "text_old": "{{Noref|date=December 2018}}\n{{Infobox VG\n|title = Growl\n|image = Growl arcadeflyer.png\n|caption = U.S. arcade flyer\n|developer = [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]\n|publisher = Taito\n|designer = \n|release = 1991\n|genre = [[Beat 'em up]]\n|modes = Up to 4 players simultaneously\n|cabinet = Upright\n|arcade system = Taito F2 System Hardware\n|display = Horizontal orientation, [[Raster graphics|Raster]]\n|platforms = [[Arcade game|Arcade]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis/Mega Drive]]\n}}\n\n'''''Growl''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Runark'''''|\u30eb\u30ca\u30fc\u30af|Run\u0101ku}}, is a [[belt scroll|belt-scrolling]] [[beat-'em-up]] originally released for the [[arcade game|arcades]] by [[Taito]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]].

The beverages produced by the company, branded as Faygo or Faygo Pop, are distributed in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Central Southern regions of the United States, as well as southern Canada. Faygo is exported to Europe by American Fizz, an official distributor of Faygo. Faygo Beverages, Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[National Beverage|National Beverage Corporation]] and started in Detroit, Michigan, in 1907 as Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works. <ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nFlavors that are suggested for new products are approved by a committee that meets quarterly, which also remove low sellers off the market. The company's best seller is [[Red Pop]]. The company introduced the now industry standard twist-off cap and the term \"pop\" for the product. This came from the sound made when the twist-off cap is removed.<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Faygo logo.png|150px|thumb|left|The original logo used circa 1940]]\nFaygo was founded in Detroit, Michigan, in November 1907,<ref name=\"idch\">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 36. |date=2001 |publisher=St. James Press |via= Funding Universe |chapter-url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/faygo-beverages-inc-history/ |accessdate=November 20, 2019 |chapter=History of Faygo Beverages Inc.}}</ref> as '''Feigenson Brothers Bottle Works''' by Russian baker immigrants Ben and Perry Feigenson.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Smith |title=Faygo celebrates 100th birthday |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070302/BIZ/703020359/1011/BIZ02 |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-30 }}</ref> The original flavors of Faygo (fruit punch, strawberry, and grape) were based on cake [[Icing (food)|frosting]] recipes used by the Feigensons in Russia.<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Initially, the brothers used a horse drawn wagon for deliveries and lived above the bottling plant.<ref name=\"idch\"/>\n\nThe business grew over the next ten years. The Feigensons were able to purchase houses, hire their first employee and a second wagon and horse for deliveries. More flavors were added including [[Sarsaparilla (soft drink)|Sassafras Soda]] and Lithiated Lemon. They built a new plant due to their success on Beaubien Street in Detroit.<ref name=\"idch\"/> \n\nIn 1921 as the company expanded, they decided the brand name \"Feigenson Brothers\" was too long and changed it to Faygo.<ref name=\"idch\"/><ref>{{cite news |last = Anders |first = Melissa |title = What's in a name?

Company chemists later resolved this issue by installing a filtration system to remove impurities from the manufacturing plant's water system.<ref name=\"Smith\"/> In the 1960s, the soda's regional popularity expanded when the company began advertising during broadcasts of [[Detroit Tigers]] games.<ref name=\"Smith\"/> With the Tiger ads reaching beyond Faygo market area at the time and inability to cancel the ads, Faygo shipped products to the wholesalers' warehouses. This increased company sales from $6 million in 1966 to $20.4 million in 1971.<ref name=\"idch\" /> Advertisements produced in the 1970s featured \"everyday people\" on a [[Boblo Island Amusement Park|Boblo Boat]] singing the \"Faygo Boat Song\".<ref name=\"Smith\"/> In the 1980s, they introduced flavored carbonated water.<ref name=\"Grim\"/> \n\nThe company introduced a low-calorie version in the 1960s called Ohana.<ref name=\"Grim\"/> Faygo introduced diet version of its line in the 1960s, this sub-line soon becomes a majority of company sales. In 1961, the Royal Line is launched as a premium product line. The Royal Hawaiian Pineapple Orange initial run's extract was not sterilized and became rancid causing a buildup of gases such that after hitting store shelves the bottles exploded. The soda was recalled and Dole gave Faygo enough sterilized juice to offset the company's losses.

The beverages produced by the company, branded as Faygo or Faygo Pop, are distributed in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Central Southern regions of the United States, as well as southern Canada. Faygo is exported to Europe by American Fizz, an official distributor of Faygo. Faygo Beverages, Inc., is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[National Beverage|National Beverage Corporation]] and started in Detroit, Michigan, in 1907 as Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works. <ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nFlavors that are suggested for new products are approved by a committee that meets quarterly, which also remove low sellers off the market. The company's best seller is [[Red Pop]]. The company introduced the now industry standard twist-off cap and the term \"pop\" for the product. This came from the sound made when the twist-off cap is removed.<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Faygo logo.png|150px|thumb|left|The original logo used circa 1940]]\nFaygo was founded in Detroit, Michigan, in November 1907,<ref name=\"idch\">{{cite book |title=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 36. |date=2001 |publisher=St. James Press |via= Funding Universe |chapter-url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/faygo-beverages-inc-history/ |accessdate=November 20, 2019 |chapter=History of Faygo Beverages Inc.}}</ref> as '''Feigenson Brothers Bottle Works''' by Russian baker immigrants Ben and Perry Feigenson.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Smith |title=Faygo celebrates 100th birthday |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070302/BIZ/703020359/1011/BIZ02 |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-30 }}</ref> The original flavors of Faygo (fruit punch, strawberry, and grape) were based on cake [[Icing (food)|frosting]] recipes used by the Feigensons in Russia.<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Initially, the brothers used a horse drawn wagon for deliveries and lived above the bottling plant.<ref name=\"idch\"/>\n\nThe business grew over the next ten years.
