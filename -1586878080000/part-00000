From OUN-B perspective, the Jewish population had already been annihilated, Russians and Germans were only temporarily in Ukraine, but Poles had to be forcefully removed.{{sfn|Snyder|2003|p=168}} The OUN-B came to believe that it had to move fast while the Germans still controlled the area in order to preempt future Polish efforts at re-establishing Poland's pre-war borders. The result was that the local OUN-B commanders in Volhynia and Galicia (if not the OUN-B leadership itself) decided that an ethnic cleansing of Poles from the area, through terror and murder, was necessary.{{sfn|Snyder|2003|p=168}}\n\nAs evidenced by both Polish and Ukrainian underground reports, initially, the only major concern of Ukrainian nationalists was that of strong [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan groups]] operating in the area.

The first OUN-B military groups were created in Volhynia in autumn 1942 with the goal of subduing the other independent groups. By February 1943, OUN had initiated a policy of murdering civilian Poles as a way of resolving the Polish question in Ukraine. In spring 1943, OUN-B partisans started to call themselves the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA)]], using the former name of the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]], another Ukrainian group operating in the area in 1942.

These retaliations were carried out using newly recruited Polish policemen. Though Volhynian Polish participation in the German Police followed UPA attacks on Polish settlements, it provided the Ukrainian Nationalists with useful sources of propaganda and was used as a justification for the cleansing action.

Polish investigators claim that the OUN-B central leadership decided in February 1943 to drive all Poles out of Volhynia, to obtain an \"ethnically pure territory\" in the postwar period. Among those who were behind the decision, Polish investigators singled out [[Dmytro Klyachkivsky]], Vasyl Ivakhov, Ivan Lytvynchuk, and Petro Oliynyk.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030828170530/http://artukraine.com/historical/volyn_trag2.htm Polish report on the massacres, article from Ukrainian webpage]</ref>\n\nEthnic violence was exacerbated with the circulation of posters and leaflets inciting the Ukrainian population to murder Poles and \"Judeo-Muscovites\" alike.<ref>\"Its main goal was to [...] remove \u2013 by force, if necessary \u2013 non-Ukrainians from the ''social and economic spheres'' of a future Ukrainian state.\" & ''Simultaneously, steps were undertaken to eliminate \"foreign elements\" in Ukraine.

Historian [[Per Anders Rudling]] states that the goal of the OUN-UPA was not to exterminate all Poles, but rather to ethnically cleanse the region in order to attain an ethnically homogeneous state.\" The goal was thus to prevent a repeat of 1918\u201320 when Poland crushed Ukrainian independence as the Polish Home Army was attempting to restore the Polish Republic within its pre-1939 borders.<ref name=\"Rudling2\" /> According to Ivan Katchanovski, the mass killings of Poles in Volhynia by the UPA cannot be classified as a genocide because there isn't evidence that the UPA intended to annihilate entire or significant parts of the Polish nation, the UPA action was mostly limited to a relatively small area and the number of Poles killed constituted quite a small fraction of the prewar Polish population on territories where the UPA operated and of the entire Polish population in Poland and Ukraine.<ref name=\"drkatch\"/>\n\nThe [[Institute of National Remembrance]] investigated the crimes committed by the UPA against the Poles in Volhynia, Galicia, and prewar [[Lublin Voivodeship]]; collecting over 10,000 pages of documents and protocols. The massacres were described by the Commission's prosecutor Piotr Zaj\u0105c as bearing the characteristics of a [[genocide]] \u2014 according to Zaj\u0105c: \"there is no doubt that the crimes committed against the people of Polish nationality have the character of genocide\".<ref name=\"Zbrodnie\">''W \u015bwietle przedstawionych wy\u017cej ustale\u0144 nie ulega w\u0105tpliwo\u015bci, \u017ce zbrodnie, kt\u00f3rych dopuszczono si\u0119 wobec ludno\u015bci narodowo\u015bci polskiej, nosz\u0105 charakter niepodlegaj\u0105cych przedawnieniu zbrodni ludob\u00f3jstwa.'' \u2013 Piotr Zaj\u0105c, ''Prze\u015bladowania ludno\u015bci narodowo\u015bci polskiej na terenie Wo\u0142ynia w latach 1939\u20131945 \u2013 ocena karnoprawna zdarze\u0144 w oparciu o ustalenia \u015bledztwa OK\u015aZpNP w Lublinie'', [in:] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323073558/http://ipn.gov.pl/download.php?s=1&id=19295 ''Zbrodnie przesz\u0142o\u015bci.

The Polish Government in Exile, which wanted the region returned to Poland, planned for a swift armed takeover of the territory as part of its overall plan for a future anti-Nazi uprising.<ref>\"From a Polish point of view, the defeat of both Germany and Russia would open the field in the east.

By 1942 the formation of sizable Polish partisan units in the east could not but remind Ukrainians of Polish territorial claims.\" ({{harvnb|Snyder|2001}})</ref> This view was compounded by OUN's prior collaboration with the Nazis, that by 1943 no understanding between the Polish government's Home Army and OUN was possible.{{sfn|Snyder|2003|p=168}}\nIn Eastern Galicia, the antagonism between Poles and Ukrainians intensified under the German occupation.<ref name=\"Mick2\">Christoph Mick. \"Incompatible experiences: Poles, Ukrainian and Jews under Soviet and German occupation 1939\u201344\".

This proved fruitless as neither side was willing to retreat from its claim to Lviv.<ref name=\"Mick2\"/>\n\nEven before the war, OUN adhered to concepts of integral nationalism in its totalistic form, according to which Ukrainian statehood required ethnic homogeneity and the Polish enemy could be defeated only by the elimination of Poles from Ukrainian territories. From OUN-B perspective, the Jewish population had already been annihilated, Russians and Germans were only temporarily in Ukraine, but Poles had to be forcefully removed.{{sfn|Snyder|2003|p=168}} The OUN-B came to believe that it had to move fast while the Germans still controlled the area in order to preempt future Polish efforts at re-establishing Poland's pre-war borders. The result was that the local OUN-B commanders in Volhynia and Galicia (if not the OUN-B leadership itself) decided that an ethnic cleansing of Poles from the area, through terror and murder, was necessary.{{sfn|Snyder|2003|p=168}}\n\nAs evidenced by both Polish and Ukrainian underground reports, initially, the only major concern of Ukrainian nationalists was that of strong [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan groups]] operating in the area.

The first OUN-B military groups were created in Volhynia in autumn 1942 with the goal of subduing the other independent groups. By February 1943, OUN had initiated a policy of murdering civilian Poles as a way of resolving the Polish question in Ukraine. In spring 1943, OUN-B partisans started to call themselves the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA)]], using the former name of the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]], another Ukrainian group operating in the area in 1942. In March 1943 approximately 5,000 Ukrainian policemen defected with their weapons and joined the UPA. Well-trained and well-armed, this group contributed to the UPA achieving dominance over other Ukrainian groups active in Volhynia.{{sfn|Snyder|2001}} Soon, the newly created OUN-B forces managed to either destroy or absorb other Ukrainian groups in Volhynia, including four [[OUN-M]] units and the [[Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army]].

These retaliations were carried out using newly recruited Polish policemen. Though Volhynian Polish participation in the German Police followed UPA attacks on Polish settlements, it provided the Ukrainian Nationalists with useful sources of propaganda and was used as a justification for the cleansing action.

Polish investigators claim that the OUN-B central leadership decided in February 1943 to drive all Poles out of Volhynia, to obtain an \"ethnically pure territory\" in the postwar period. Among those who were behind the decision, Polish investigators singled out [[Dmytro Klyachkivsky]], Vasyl Ivakhov, Ivan Lytvynchuk, and Petro Oliynyk.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030828170530/http://artukraine.com/historical/volyn_trag2.htm Polish report on the massacres, article from Ukrainian webpage]</ref>\n\nEthnic violence was exacerbated with the circulation of posters and leaflets inciting the Ukrainian population to murder Poles and \"Judeo-Muscovites\" alike.<ref>\"Its main goal was to [...] remove \u2013 by force, if necessary \u2013 non-Ukrainians from the ''social and economic spheres'' of a future Ukrainian state.\" & ''Simultaneously, steps were undertaken to eliminate \"foreign elements\" in Ukraine.

Historian [[Per Anders Rudling]] states that the goal of the OUN-UPA was not to exterminate all Poles, but rather to ethnically cleanse the region in order to attain an ethnically homogeneous state.\" The goal was thus to prevent a repeat of 1918\u201320 when Poland crushed Ukrainian independence as the Polish Home Army was attempting to restore the Polish Republic within its pre-1939 borders.<ref name=\"Rudling2\" /> According to Ivan Katchanovski, the mass killings of Poles in Volhynia by the UPA cannot be classified as a genocide because there isn't evidence that the UPA intended to annihilate entire or significant parts of the Polish nation, the UPA action was mostly limited to a relatively small area and the number of Poles killed constituted quite a small fraction of the prewar Polish population on territories where the UPA operated and of the entire Polish population in Poland and Ukraine.<ref name=\"drkatch\"/>\n\nThe [[Institute of National Remembrance]] investigated the crimes committed by the UPA against the Poles in Volhynia, Galicia, and prewar [[Lublin Voivodeship]]; collecting over 10,000 pages of documents and protocols. The massacres were described by the Commission's prosecutor Piotr Zaj\u0105c as bearing the characteristics of a [[genocide]] \u2014 according to Zaj\u0105c: \"there is no doubt that the crimes committed against the people of Polish nationality have the character of genocide\".<ref name=\"Zbrodnie\">''W \u015bwietle przedstawionych wy\u017cej ustale\u0144 nie ulega w\u0105tpliwo\u015bci, \u017ce zbrodnie, kt\u00f3rych dopuszczono si\u0119 wobec ludno\u015bci narodowo\u015bci polskiej, nosz\u0105 charakter niepodlegaj\u0105cych przedawnieniu zbrodni ludob\u00f3jstwa.'' \u2013 Piotr Zaj\u0105c, ''Prze\u015bladowania ludno\u015bci narodowo\u015bci polskiej na terenie Wo\u0142ynia w latach 1939\u20131945 \u2013 ocena karnoprawna zdarze\u0144 w oparciu o ustalenia \u015bledztwa OK\u015aZpNP w Lublinie'', [in:] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323073558/http://ipn.gov.pl/download.php?s=1&id=19295 ''Zbrodnie przesz\u0142o\u015bci.
