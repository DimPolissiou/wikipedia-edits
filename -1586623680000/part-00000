Herod overthrew the Hasmonean [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus]] in a three-year-long war between 37 and 34 BCE, ruled under Roman overlordship until his death ca. 3 BCE, and officially passed on the throne to his sons, thus establishing his own, so-called [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] dynasty.\n\nHerod was granted the title of \"King of Judea\" by the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>[http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/war1.html Jewish War 1].14.4: [[Mark Antony]] \" ...then resolved to get him made king of the Jews ... told them that it was for their advantage in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian Wars|Parthian war]] that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it.

There have been mixed interpretations concerning Herod's popularity during his reign. In ''The Jewish War'', [[Josephus]] characterizes Herod's rule in generally favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, ''Jewish Antiquities'', Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod's reign.<ref name=\"SCohen271\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed. Hershel Shanks. (Biblical Archaeology Society, 1999), p. 271.</ref>\n\nHerod's despotic rule has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace towards him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents removed by force.<ref name=\"SCohen271\"/> He had a bodyguard of 2,000 soldiers.<ref name=Guard>{{cite book |last=Rocca |first=Samuel |authorlink= |year=2009 |title=The Army of Herod the Great |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znRtCb6mXLIC |location= |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |pages=15\u201316 |isbn=978-1-8460-3206-6 |accessdate=2 November 2013 }}</ref> Josephus describes various units of Herod's personal guard taking part in Herod's funeral, including the ''Doryphnoroi'', and a [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] (probably [[Gauls|Gallic]]) and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] contingent.<ref name=Guard/> While the term ''Doryphnoroi'' does not have an ethnic connotation, the unit was probably composed of distinguished veteran soldiers and young men from the most influential Jewish families.<ref name=Guard/> Thracians had served in the Jewish armies since the Hasmonean dynasty, while the Celtic contingent were former bodyguards of [[Cleopatra]] given as a gift by Augustus to Herod following the [[Battle of Actium]].<ref name=Guard/> The Germanic contingent was modeled upon Augustus's personal bodyguard, the ''[[Imperial German Bodyguard (Roman)|Germani Corporis Custodes]]'', responsible for guarding the palace.<ref name=Guard/>\n\nHerod spent lavish sums on his various building projects and generous gifts to other dominions, including Rome itself. His buildings were very large, ambitious projects. Herod was responsible for the construction of the Temple Mount, a portion of which remains today as the Western Wall. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in [[hydraulic cement]] and underwater construction to build the harbor at [[Caesarea]].<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> While Herod's zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although he built fortresses ([[Masada]], [[Herodium]], Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and [[Machaerus]]) in which he and his family could take refuge in case of insurrection, these vast projects were also intended to gain the support of the Jews and improve his reputation as a leader.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed.

In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews.<ref name=\"AJLevine\"/> Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation\u2014his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" /> The two major Jewish sects of the day, the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]], both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were discontented because Herod disregarded many of their demands with respect to the Temple's construction. The Sadducees, who were closely associated with priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from [[Babylonia]] and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora.<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H. \"The Jewish\u2013Christian Schism,\" in ''From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism'' (Hoboken: Ktav Publishing House, 1991), p. 145.</ref> Herod's outreach efforts gained him little, and at the end of his reign anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as pent-up resentments boiled over. The scope of the disturbances sparked hopes that the Jews of Judea might some day overthrow the Roman overlords, hopes reawakened decades later in the outbreak of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Revolt of 70 CE]].<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" />\n\n==Architectural achievements==\n{{Main|Herodian architecture}}\n\nHerod's most famous and ambitious project was the expansion of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem.  Herod's rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem was done so that he would \"have a capital city worthy of his dignity and grandeur\"<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> and with this reconstruction Herod hoped to gain more support from the Jews.<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and [[Robinson's Arch]] may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death, during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa II]].<ref name=Western>{{cite web|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn't Finish it (december 2011)|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1882&hist=1|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th year of his reign (20\u201319 BCE), Herod rebuilt the Temple on \"a more magnificent scale\".<ref name=temple>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=123&letter=T&search=Herod's%20Temple Temple of Herod] at ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>  Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished in a year and a half.<ref>Graetz, Heinrich (1893) \"History of the Jews: From the Reign of Hyrcanus (135 BCE) to the Completion of the Babylonian Talmud (500 AD)\", Cosimo Books, New York, Volume 2, 2009 ed, p.109</ref> To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding.<ref name=temple/> The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70 CE, is sometimes referred to as [[Herod's Temple]]. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the [[Western Wall]]. These walls created a flat platform (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.\n\nHerod's other achievements include the development of water supplies for Jerusalem, building fortresses such as [[Masada]] and [[Herodium]], and founding new cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]] and the enclosures of [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] and [[Mamre]] in [[Hebron]]. He and Cleopatra owned a monopoly over the extraction of [[asphalt]] from the Dead Sea, which was used in shipbuilding. He leased [[copper]] mines on [[Cyprus]] from the Roman emperor.\n\n==New Testament references==\n{{Main|Massacre of the Innocents}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 172.png|thumbnail|Massacre of the Innocents by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], 1860]]\nHerod appears in the [[Gospel of Matthew]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:1\u201323|NRSV}}</ref> which describes an event known as the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. According to this account, after the birth of [[Jesus]], [[Biblical magi|some magi from the East]] visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of \"the one having been born king of the Jews\", because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the \"Anointed One\" (the [[Messiah]], Greek: \u1f49 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, ''ho Christos'') was to be born. They answered, in [[Bethlehem]], citing [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy#Micah 5:2|Micah 5:2]]. Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to \"report to me, so that I too may go and worship him\". However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity. Joseph and his family stayed in Egypt until Herod's death, then moved to [[Nazareth]] in Galilee to avoid living under Herod's son [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]].\n\nMost modern biographers of Herod, and probably a majority of biblical scholars, dismiss Matthew's story as an invention. (Although many rule this out as being fake, new evidence found through NASA suggests it was possible for this to have happened.) Jesus was born around the beginning of 3 BCE, and NASA evidence suggests that Herod actually died towards the end of 3 BCE. It is a known fact that ancient historians forgot to record the year 0. NASA evidence proves what Flavius Josephus claimed was off by exactly one year. Jesus Christ was born during 3 BCE and died on April 25th, 31 CE at the age of 33 years old. This accurately fits with Herod when correcting the mistake of ancient historians. <ref>{{Cite book| last      = Maier| first     = Paul L.| chapter   = Herod and the Infants of Bethlehem| editor1-last  = Summers | editor1-first = Ray | editor2-last  = Vardaman| editor2-first = Jerry | title     = Chronos, Kairos, Christos II: Chronological, Nativity, and Religious Studies in Memory of Ray Summers| publisher = Mercer University Press| year      = 1998| chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/?id=mWnYvI5RdLMC&pg=PA169&dq=Herod+and+the+Infants+of+Bethlehem#v=onepage&q=Herod%20and%20the%20Infants%20of%20Bethlehem&f=false| pages       = 170\u2013171| isbn      = 978-0865545823| ref       = harv}}</ref> Contemporary non-biblical sources, including Herod's friend and personal historian, Nicolas of Damascus, provide no corroboration for Matthew's account of the massacre,<ref name=sanders>[[E.

Although Herod considered himself king of the Jews, he let it be known that he also represented the non-Jews living in Judea, building temples for other religions outside of the Jewish areas of his kingdom. Many Jews questioned the authenticity of Herod's Judaism on account of his [[Idumean]] background and his infamous murders of members of his family. However, he generally respected traditional Jewish observances in his public life. For instance, he minted coins without human images to be used in Jewish areas and acknowledged the sanctity of the [[Second Temple]] by employing priests in the construction of the Temple.<ref name=\"SCohen272\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed.

He took them to [[Aquileia]] to be tried. Augustus reconciled the three. Herod supported the financially strapped [[Olympic Games]] and ensured their future. Herod amended his will so that Alexander and Aristobulus rose in the royal succession, but Antipater would be higher in the succession.\n* Circa 10 BCE \u2013 The newly expanded temple in Jerusalem was inaugurated.

There have been mixed interpretations concerning Herod's popularity during his reign. In ''The Jewish War'', [[Josephus]] characterizes Herod's rule in generally favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, ''Jewish Antiquities'', Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod's reign.<ref name=\"SCohen271\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed. Hershel Shanks. (Biblical Archaeology Society, 1999), p. 271.</ref>\n\nHerod's despotic rule has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace towards him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents removed by force.<ref name=\"SCohen271\"/> He had a bodyguard of 2,000 soldiers.<ref name=Guard>{{cite book |last=Rocca |first=Samuel |authorlink= |year=2009 |title=The Army of Herod the Great |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znRtCb6mXLIC |location= |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |pages=15\u201316 |isbn=978-1-8460-3206-6 |accessdate=2 November 2013 }}</ref> Josephus describes various units of Herod's personal guard taking part in Herod's funeral, including the ''Doryphnoroi'', and a [[Thracians|Thracian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] (probably [[Gauls|Gallic]]) and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] contingent.<ref name=Guard/> While the term ''Doryphnoroi'' does not have an ethnic connotation, the unit was probably composed of distinguished veteran soldiers and young men from the most influential Jewish families.<ref name=Guard/> Thracians had served in the Jewish armies since the Hasmonean dynasty, while the Celtic contingent were former bodyguards of [[Cleopatra]] given as a gift by Augustus to Herod following the [[Battle of Actium]].<ref name=Guard/> The Germanic contingent was modeled upon Augustus's personal bodyguard, the ''[[Imperial German Bodyguard (Roman)|Germani Corporis Custodes]]'', responsible for guarding the palace.<ref name=Guard/>\n\nHerod spent lavish sums on his various building projects and generous gifts to other dominions, including Rome itself. His buildings were very large, ambitious projects. Herod was responsible for the construction of the Temple Mount, a portion of which remains today as the Western Wall. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in [[hydraulic cement]] and underwater construction to build the harbor at [[Caesarea]].<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> While Herod's zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although he built fortresses ([[Masada]], [[Herodium]], Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and [[Machaerus]]) in which he and his family could take refuge in case of insurrection, these vast projects were also intended to gain the support of the Jews and improve his reputation as a leader.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\">Cohen, Shaye. \"Roman Domination: The Jewish Revolt and the Destruction of the Second Temple,\" in ''Ancient Israel'', ed.

In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews.<ref name=\"AJLevine\"/> Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation\u2014his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects.<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" /> The two major Jewish sects of the day, the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]], both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were discontented because Herod disregarded many of their demands with respect to the Temple's construction. The Sadducees, who were closely associated with priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from [[Babylonia]] and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora.<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H. \"The Jewish\u2013Christian Schism,\" in ''From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism'' (Hoboken: Ktav Publishing House, 1991), p. 145.</ref> Herod's outreach efforts gained him little, and at the end of his reign anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as pent-up resentments boiled over. The scope of the disturbances sparked hopes that the Jews of Judea might some day overthrow the Roman overlords, hopes reawakened decades later in the outbreak of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Great Revolt of 70 CE]].<ref name=\"CohenShaye\" />\n\n==Architectural achievements==\n{{Main|Herodian architecture}}\n\nHerod's most famous and ambitious project was the expansion of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem.  Herod's rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem was done so that he would \"have a capital city worthy of his dignity and grandeur\"<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> and with this reconstruction Herod hoped to gain more support from the Jews.<ref name=\"Roman Domination\" /> Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and [[Robinson's Arch]] may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death, during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa II]].<ref name=Western>{{cite web|title=Building the Western Wall: Herod Began it but Didn't Finish it (december 2011)|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/Article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&subj_id=240&id=1882&hist=1|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th year of his reign (20\u201319 BCE), Herod rebuilt the Temple on \"a more magnificent scale\".<ref name=temple>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=123&letter=T&search=Herod's%20Temple Temple of Herod] at ''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref>  Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished in a year and a half.<ref>Graetz, Heinrich (1893) \"History of the Jews: From the Reign of Hyrcanus (135 BCE) to the Completion of the Babylonian Talmud (500 AD)\", Cosimo Books, New York, Volume 2, 2009 ed, p.109</ref> To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding.<ref name=temple/> The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70 CE, is sometimes referred to as [[Herod's Temple]]. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the [[Western Wall]]. These walls created a flat platform (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.\n\nHerod's other achievements include the development of water supplies for Jerusalem, building fortresses such as [[Masada]] and [[Herodium]], and founding new cities such as [[Caesarea Maritima]] and the enclosures of [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] and [[Mamre]] in [[Hebron]]. He and Cleopatra owned a monopoly over the extraction of [[asphalt]] from the Dead Sea, which was used in shipbuilding. He leased [[copper]] mines on [[Cyprus]] from the Roman emperor.\n\n==New Testament references==\n{{Main|Massacre of the Innocents}}\n[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 172.png|thumbnail|Massacre of the Innocents by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]], 1860]]\nHerod appears in the [[Gospel of Matthew]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:1\u201323|NRSV}}</ref> which describes an event known as the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. According to this account, after the birth of [[Jesus]], [[Biblical magi|some magi from the East]] visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of \"the one having been born king of the Jews\", because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the \"Anointed One\" (the [[Messiah]], Greek: \u1f49 \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, ''ho Christos'') was to be born. They answered, in [[Bethlehem]], citing [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy#Micah 5:2|Micah 5:2]]. Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to \"report to me, so that I too may go and worship him\". However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity.

Herod then executed his son, and again changed his will: [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] (from the marriage with Malthace) would rule as ethnarch over the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrachy of Judea]], while [[Herod Antipas|Antipas]] (by Malthace) and [[Herod Philip II|Philip]] (from the fifth marriage with Cleopatra of Jerusalem) would rule as tetrarchs over Galilee and [[Perea (Holy Land)|Peraea]] (Transjordan), also over Gaulanitis ([[Golan]]), [[Trachonitis]] (Hebrew: Argob), Batanaea (now Ard-el-Bathanyeh) and [[Panias]]. [[Salome I]] was also given a small [[toparchy]] in the Gaza region. As Augustus did not confirm his will, no one received the title of King; however, the three sons were granted rule of the stated territories.\n\n==Wives and children==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Herod's wives and children'''\n!

It is located in the village of [[Blickling]] north of [[Aylsham]] in [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]], England and has been in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since 1940.\n\n== Early history ==\nIn the 15th century, Blickling was in the possession of [[John Fastolf|Sir John Fastolf of Caister]] in Norfolk (1380\u20131459), who made a fortune in the [[Hundred Years' War]], and whose coat of arms is still on display there.  Later, the property was in the possession of the Boleyn family, and home to [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]], later Earl of Wiltshire, and his wife [[Elizabeth Boleyn|Elizabeth]] between 1499 and 1505. Although the exact birth dates of their children are unknown, historians including [[Eric Ives]] are confident that all three surviving children were likely born at Blickling \u2013 [[Mary Boleyn|Mary]] in about 1500, [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]] in about 1501, and [[George Boleyn|George]] in about 1504.<ref name=\"Ives\">Ives, Eric.

The architect of [[Hatfield House]], [[Robert Lyminge]], is credited with the design of the current structure. The Lord Chief Justice married Dorothy, the daughter of [[Sir Robert Bell]] of [[Beaupre Hall]], [[Outwell]]/[[Upwell|Upwell, Norfolk]], [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] 1572\u20131576. A grand display of heraldic material is present throughout the estate.\n\n==Later history==\nIn 1698 the estate passed down [[John Hobart, 1st Earl of Buckinghamshire|Sir John Hobart, the 5th Baronet]] who was created [[Earl of Buckinghamshire]] in 1746. He was responsible for creating the [[ha-ha]] and building the Doric Temple in the grounds, as well as extending the park by the purchase of adjacent land. His son [[John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire| the second earl]] remodelled the hall between 1765 and 1785. Although the estate then passed down to his youngest daughter Caroline, who was married to Lord Suffield, the couple died childless and it thus devolved to Caroline's nephew William Kerr, the 8th Marquess of Lothian, who remodelled the west front. It thereafter passed down in the Kerr family.<ref name=NHLEGarden/>\n\n== Recent history ==\nAfter the death of [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] (the last private owner of Blickling) in December 1940, the Blickling estate passed into the care of the National Trust as part of his bequest.<ref name=Lot>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blickling-estate/things-to-see-and-do/events/more-seasonal-events/ Lord Lothian exhibition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626120000/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blickling-estate/things-to-see-and-do/events/more-seasonal-events/ |date=26 June 2015 }} Retrieved 25 June 2015</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the house was requisitioned and served as the Officers' Mess of nearby [[RAF Oulton]]. It was at this time that the house and its estate passed to The National Trust, under the terms of the Country Houses Scheme. [[RAF]] servicemen and women were billeted within the grounds in [[Nissen huts]], whilst RAF Officers were housed within Blickling itself. The adjacent lake was used by RAF service personnel to practice dinghy drills during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Martin|title=100 Group (Bomber support) : RAF Bomber Command in World War II|date=2006|publisher=Pen & Sword|location=Barnsley|isbn=1-84415-418-1|page=127|edition=1}}</ref> The National Trust has created the RAF Oulton Museum on site in tribute to the RAF pilots and ground crew who served in the Second World War, and this may be visited for no additional entrance fee.\n\nAt the end of the war, the house was de-requisitioned. The National Trust again let it to tenants until 1960, when the Trust began the work to restore the house to a style reflecting its history. The house and grounds were opened to the public in 1962 and remain open under the name of \"Blickling Estate\".\n\nIn 2015 the National Trust marked the 75th anniversary of Philip Kerr's death with a celebration of his life and times.<ref name=Lot />\n\nWork began in October 2015 to introduce a [[heat pump]] system, using residual warmth from the lake. A raft of tubes, filled with a plant-based [[glycol]], would be sunk into the lake and the liquid pumped into the main boiler-room for conversion to a higher temperature to heat the hall and west wing of the building. The new system would allow the removal of two oil tanks, and produce an annual saving of more than 25,000 litres of oil, and \u00a316,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Biddle |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/environment/in_depth_look_at_how_blickling_hall_is_set_to_be_heated_using_its_lake_1_4145079 |title=In-depth look at how Blickling Hall is set to be heated using its lake \u2013 Environment \u2013 Eastern Daily Press |publisher=Edp24.co.uk |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Blickling Hall, Norfolk: Lake Source Heat Pump: Historic Impact Assessment for the National Trust |date=May 2015 |url=http://www.broadland.gov.uk/MVM.DMS/Planning%20Application/685000/685638/20150920%20Historic%20Impact%20Assessment.pdf |publisher=Broadland District Council |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093711/http://www.broadland.gov.uk/MVM.DMS/Planning%20Application/685000/685638/20150920%20Historic%20Impact%20Assessment.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Library ==\nThe library at Blickling Estate contains one of the most historically significant collections of manuscripts and books in England.

A garden mount\u2013 an artificial hill in Blickling's flat landscape, was made to provide views of the new garden. With the accession of [[Sir John Hobart, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Hobart]] (later the 1st Earl of Buckingham) in 1698 the garden was expanded to add a new wilderness and the temple was constructed.\n\nIn the latter half of the 18th century John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckingham, embarked on works that would radically change the appearance of the gardens. All traces of formality were removed, and naturally arranged clumps of trees were planted to create a [[landscape garden]]. By the 1780s an [[orangery]] had been built to overwinter tender [[citrus]] trees. Following the 2nd Earl's death in 1793, his youngest daughter Caroline, Lady Suffield, employed landscape gardener [[Humphry Repton]] and his son [[John Adey Repton]] to advise on garden matters. John Adey Repton would go on to provide designs for many garden features. The estate was inherited by nine-year-old William Schomberg Robert Kerr, 8th Marquess of Lothian in 1840. He later re-introduced the formality and colour schemes of the parterre. After his death at the age of 38, responsibility for the gardens rested with Lady Lothian and her head gardener Mr Lyon. [[Philip Henry Kerr]], 11th Marquis of Lothian, inherited the estate in 1930. After disparaging comments in a publication of [[Country Life (magazine)|''Country Life'']], Lothian engaged socialite gardener [[Norah Lindsay]] to remodel the gardens. In the parterre she replaced the jumble of minuscule flower beds with four large square beds planted with a mixture of herbaceous plants in graduated and harmonious colours. Other improvements included removal of a line of [[conifers]] in the Temple walk, which were replaced with plantings of [[azaleas]].<ref name=Bli>Newman, J.''The National Trust, Blickling Estate'' pp56-65, p69 {{ISBN|0-7078-0086-2}}</ref>\n\n== The garden today ==\nThe garden at Blickling covers {{convert|55|acre}}<ref>[http://www.ngs.org.uk/gardens/gardenfinder/garden.aspx?id=5918 National Garden Scheme-Blickling Hall gardens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327002630/http://ngs.org.uk/gardens/gardenfinder/garden.aspx?id=5918 |date=27 March 2013 }} Retrieved 15 April 2013</ref> and contains formal and informal gardens, [[Grade II listed]] buildings and structures, woodland, specimen trees, [[Victorian era|Victorian]] garden ornaments, [[topiary]], the [[kitchen garden]] (open to the public 2010), and 18th century [[Taxus baccata|yew]] hedges. The lawns which frame the main approach to the hall are bounded by yew hedges which were first recorded by William Freeman of Hamels in 1745.<ref name=Bli/> Surrounding the hall on three sides is the dry moat. The plantings in the moist, sheltered conditions of the moat were considerably revised by Lindsay who introduced [[hosta]], species of [[hydrangea]], [[buddleia]] and [[rosemary]]. \n\nTo the rear of the property is the noted Parterre garden which is located on the east lawn. Originally created as a Victorian sunken garden it was remodelled by Lindsay in the early 1930s. Set around an 18th-century listed stone fountain, she divided the garden into four large, colourful [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] beds surrounded by L shaped borders stocked with roses and [[catmint]] with an [[acorn]] shaped yew marking each corner. In the terraces above the parterre there are plantings of [[peony]], seasonal beds and the double borders created in 2006, contain a wide variety of [[perennials]], shrubs and [[grasses]] with colours ranging from hot to cool. Close by, are the White and Black borders which were established in 2009, together with a collection of [[elaeagnus]]. The western side of the garden features the lawned Acre which is fringed by a spreading [[oriental plane]] tree. Outdoor sports such as [[croquet]] are played here in the summer months. Further highlights are a collection of [[magnolia]] underplanted with autumn [[cyclamen]], the shell fountain and the kitchen garden. To the north of the parterre is the Wilderness garden which is bisected by radial grassed avenues flanked with [[Quercus cerris|turkey oak]], [[Tilia|lime]] and [[beech]] trees and naturalised bulbs. \n\n[[File:Blickling Hall, Gardens and Park (4514902500).jpg|thumb|The orangery]]\nThe wilderness hides a Secret Garden with a [[Summerhouse (building)|summerhouse]], scented plants and a central [[sundial]]. Nearby is the listed 18th century [[orangery]] which houses a collection of [[citrus]] trees. Adjacent, to the building is a steep sided dell which is home to many woodland plants including a selection of [[hellebore]] and [[foxglove]]. In 2009, an area of woodland was cleared close to the orangery to create a new garden. Stocked with a wide range of woodland plants including [[camellia]] and varieties of [[mahonia]]. Opened in 2010, it will be known as the Orangery Garden. The Grade II listed Temple is approached by the Temple walk which is lined with [[azalea]] planted by Lindsay in her original 1930s design.

It is located in the village of [[Blickling]] north of [[Aylsham]] in [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]], England and has been in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since 1940.\n\n== Early history ==\nIn the 15th century, Blickling was in the possession of [[John Fastolf|Sir John Fastolf of Caister]] in Norfolk (1380\u20131459), who made a fortune in the [[Hundred Years' War]], and whose coat of arms is still on display there.  Later, the property was in the possession of the Boleyn family, and home to [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]], later Earl of Wiltshire, and his wife [[Elizabeth Boleyn|Elizabeth]] between 1499 and 1505. Although the exact birth dates of their children are unknown, historians including [[Eric Ives]] are confident that all three surviving children were likely born at Blickling \u2013 [[Mary Boleyn|Mary]] in about 1500, [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]] in about 1501, and [[George Boleyn|George]] in about 1504.<ref name=\"Ives\">Ives, Eric. ''The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn.'' 2004, Blackwell Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|9781405134637}}, pp. 3, 14\u201315.</ref> A statue and portrait of Anne may be found at Blickling Estate which carry the inscription, \"Anna Bolena hic nata 1507\" (''Anne Boleyn born here 1507''), based on earlier scholarship which assigned Anne a (now thought highly improbable) year of birth of 1507.<ref name=\"Ives\" />\n\nThe house of Blickling seen today was built on the ruins of the old Boleyn property in the reign of [[James I of England|James I]], by [[Sir Henry Hobart]], [[Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] and 1st Baronet, who bought Blickling from Robert Clere in 1616. The architect of [[Hatfield House]], [[Robert Lyminge]], is credited with the design of the current structure. The Lord Chief Justice married Dorothy, the daughter of [[Sir Robert Bell]] of [[Beaupre Hall]], [[Outwell]]/[[Upwell|Upwell, Norfolk]], [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] 1572\u20131576. A grand display of heraldic material is present throughout the estate.\n\n==Later history==\nIn 1698 the estate passed down [[John Hobart, 1st Earl of Buckinghamshire|Sir John Hobart, the 5th Baronet]] who was created [[Earl of Buckinghamshire]] in 1746. He was responsible for creating the ha-ha and building the Doric Temple in the grounds, as well as extending the park by the purchase of adjacent land. His son [[John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire| the second earl]] remodelled the hall between 1765 and 1785. Although the estate then passed down to his youngest daughter Caroline, who was married to Lord Suffield, the couple died childless and it thus devolved to Caroline's nephew William Kerr, the 8th Marquess of Lothian, who remodelled the west front. It thereafter passed down in the Kerr family.<ref name=NHLEGarden/>\n\n== Recent history ==\nAfter the death of [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian]] (the last private owner of Blickling) in December 1940, the Blickling estate passed into the care of the National Trust as part of his bequest.<ref name=Lot>[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blickling-estate/things-to-see-and-do/events/more-seasonal-events/ Lord Lothian exhibition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626120000/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blickling-estate/things-to-see-and-do/events/more-seasonal-events/ |date=26 June 2015 }} Retrieved 25 June 2015</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] the house was requisitioned and served as the Officers' Mess of nearby [[RAF Oulton]]. It was at this time that the house and its estate passed to The National Trust, under the terms of the Country Houses Scheme. [[RAF]] servicemen and women were billeted within the grounds in [[Nissen huts]], whilst RAF Officers were housed within Blickling itself. The adjacent lake was used by RAF service personnel to practice dinghy drills during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowman|first1=Martin|title=100 Group (Bomber support) : RAF Bomber Command in World War II|date=2006|publisher=Pen & Sword|location=Barnsley|isbn=1-84415-418-1|page=127|edition=1}}</ref> The National Trust has created the RAF Oulton Museum on site in tribute to the RAF pilots and ground crew who served in the Second World War, and this may be visited for no additional entrance fee.\n\nAt the end of the war, the house was de-requisitioned. The National Trust again let it to tenants until 1960, when the Trust began the work to restore the house to a style reflecting its history. The house and grounds were opened to the public in 1962 and remain open under the name of \"Blickling Estate\".\n\nIn 2015 the National Trust marked the 75th anniversary of Philip Kerr's death with a celebration of his life and times.<ref name=Lot />\n\nWork began in October 2015 to introduce a [[heat pump]] system, using residual warmth from the lake. A raft of tubes, filled with a plant-based [[glycol]], would be sunk into the lake and the liquid pumped into the main boiler-room for conversion to a higher temperature to heat the hall and west wing of the building. The new system would allow the removal of two oil tanks, and produce an annual saving of more than 25,000 litres of oil, and \u00a316,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Biddle |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/environment/in_depth_look_at_how_blickling_hall_is_set_to_be_heated_using_its_lake_1_4145079 |title=In-depth look at how Blickling Hall is set to be heated using its lake \u2013 Environment \u2013 Eastern Daily Press |publisher=Edp24.co.uk |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Blickling Hall, Norfolk: Lake Source Heat Pump: Historic Impact Assessment for the National Trust |date=May 2015 |url=http://www.broadland.gov.uk/MVM.DMS/Planning%20Application/685000/685638/20150920%20Historic%20Impact%20Assessment.pdf |publisher=Broadland District Council |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093711/http://www.broadland.gov.uk/MVM.DMS/Planning%20Application/685000/685638/20150920%20Historic%20Impact%20Assessment.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Library ==\nThe library at Blickling Estate contains one of the most historically significant collections of manuscripts and books in England.

After [[Sir Henry Hobart]] acquired the estate in 1616, he remodelled the gardens to include ponds, wilderness and a [[parterre]]. A garden mount\u2013 an artificial hill in Blickling's flat landscape, was made to provide views of the new garden. With the accession of [[Sir John Hobart, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Hobart]] (later the 1st Earl of Buckingham) in 1698 the garden was expanded to add a new wilderness and the temple was constructed.\n\nIn the latter half of the 18th century John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckingham, embarked on works that would radically change the appearance of the gardens. All traces of formality were removed, and naturally arranged clumps of trees were planted to create a [[landscape garden]]. By the 1780s an [[orangery]] had been built to overwinter tender [[citrus]] trees. Following the 2nd Earl's death in 1793, his youngest daughter Caroline, Lady Suffield, employed landscape gardener [[Humphry Repton]] and his son [[John Adey Repton]] to advise on garden matters. John Adey Repton would go on to provide designs for many garden features. The estate was inherited by nine-year-old William Schomberg Robert Kerr, 8th Marquess of Lothian in 1840. He later re-introduced the formality and colour schemes of the parterre. After his death at the age of 38, responsibility for the gardens rested with Lady Lothian and her head gardener Mr Lyon. [[Philip Henry Kerr]], 11th Marquis of Lothian, inherited the estate in 1930. After disparaging comments in a publication of [[Country Life (magazine)|''Country Life'']], Lothian engaged socialite gardener [[Norah Lindsay]] to remodel the gardens. In the parterre she replaced the jumble of minuscule flower beds with four large square beds planted with a mixture of herbaceous plants in graduated and harmonious colours. Other improvements included removal of a line of [[conifers]] in the Temple walk, which were replaced with plantings of [[azaleas]].<ref name=Bli>Newman, J.''The National Trust, Blickling Estate'' pp56-65, p69 {{ISBN|0-7078-0086-2}}</ref>\n\n== The garden today ==\nThe garden at Blickling covers {{convert|55|acre}}<ref>[http://www.ngs.org.uk/gardens/gardenfinder/garden.aspx?id=5918 National Garden Scheme-Blickling Hall gardens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327002630/http://ngs.org.uk/gardens/gardenfinder/garden.aspx?id=5918 |date=27 March 2013 }} Retrieved 15 April 2013</ref> and contains formal and informal gardens, [[Grade II listed]] buildings and structures, woodland, specimen trees, [[Victorian era|Victorian]] garden ornaments, [[topiary]], the [[kitchen garden]] (open to the public 2010), and 18th century [[Taxus baccata|yew]] hedges.

Other nearby notable sites include the Jane Welsh Carlyle House, Mitchell's Close and the birthplace of author and government reformer Samuel Smiles on the High Street, marked by a commemorative plaque.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - LOTHIAN AND LINLITQVO - The Lothians Had2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|[[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu's]] map of 1654 showing the area around Haddington.

It developed into the fourth-largest town in Scotland during the [[High Middle Ages]], and later was at the centre of the mid-eighteenth century [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution]].\n\nIn 1641, an Act was passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to encourage the production of fine cloth, and in 1645 an amendment went through stating that the masters and workers of manufactories would be exempt from military service. As a result of this, more factories were established; these included the New Mills. This factory suffered during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]] with the loss of its cloth to [[General Monck]]. A new charter was drawn up in May 1681, and major capital invested in new machinery, but the New Mills had mixed fortunes, inevitably affected by the lack of protectionism for Scottish manufactured cloth. The ''[[Scots Courant]]'' reported in 1712 that New Mills was to be \"rouped\" (auctioned). The property was sold on 16 February 1713 and the machinery and plant on 20 March. The lands of New Mills were purchased by [[Colonel Francis Charteris]] and he changed their name to Amisfield.\n[[File:Riggs at Haddington.jpg|thumb|An illustration from the 1690s showing the runrig system in operation in Haddington]]\nAs the county town of East Lothian, Haddington is the seat of [[East Lothian Council]] with offices located at John Muir House behind Court Street. This building occupies the site of Haddington's twelfth century royal palace and adjoins the former Sheriff Court complex. The town centre is home to a wide range of independent retailers including: a bookshop, two sports shops, a saddlery and country goods specialist, two butchers, a hardware shop, cookware shop and several gift shops alongside several pubs, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Nationwide retailers with a presence in Haddington include: [[Tesco]], [[M&Co]], [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Aldi]] and [[Co-op Food]]. Besides retail and administration, the town is also home to various law firms and has industrial capacity in the works beside the Tyne at the Victoria Bridge (PureMalt), and around the site of the old station (Lemac), and various smaller industrial units and garages. Haddington is also home to the offices of the local newspaper the ''East Lothian Courier''. There is a farmers' market held on the last Saturday of the month in Court Street.\n\n==Historic core==\nThe town centre largely retains its historic street plan with Court Street, High Street, Market Street and Hardgate defining the edges of the original open triangular medieval market place, divided by a central island of buildings developed from the 16th century onwards on the site of market stalls.<ref>{{cite web |title=zoomable 25 inch O.S. map from 1892 |url=https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=17&lat=55.9563&lon=-2.7797&layers=168&b=3 |website=National Library of Scotland |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> To the north and south the medieval rigg pattern of [[burgage]] plots can still be observed with narrow buildings fronting the main streets and long plots behind stretching back, originally to the line of the old town walls, accessed by small closes and [[pend]]s. The historic importance of the town's relatively unaltered medieval plan and significant survival of historic buildings was recognised as early as the 1950s, with Haddington subject to an Improvement Scheme, Scotland's earliest, which saw many period properties rehabilitated by the Town Council (under the leadership of Frank Tindall as Director of Planning) and a pioneering town colour scheme developed, resulting in the distinctive and colourful townscape seen today. Some comprehensive redevelopment did occur, chiefly around Newton Port and Hardgate to allow for widening of these narrow streets to improve motor traffic flow. This included the demolition of Bothwell Castle<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacGibbon |first1=David |last2=Ross |first2=Thomas |title=The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth century |date=1887 |publisher=D.

Designed by architect Isaac Ware<ref>''The Country Houses, Castles and Mansions of East Lothian,'' by Sonia Baker {{ISBN|978-1-84033-457-9}}</ref> and built of Garvald red freestone for [[Francis Charteris (rake)|Colonel Francis Charteris]], it was described in  ''The Buildings of Scotland'' as \"the most important building of the orthodox [[Palladian]] school in Scotland.\" John Henderson built the walled garden in 1783, and the castellated stable block in 1785. The park in front of the house, possibly landscaped by James Bowie, is today entirely ploughed. A victim of dry rot, the house was demolished in 1928.\n\nAll that remains of Amisfield today are the summer house, walled garden, ice house, chapel, and gates.\n\n[[Lennoxlove House]], a historic thirteenth-century house and estate, lies half a mile south of Haddington. Built by the Giffards of [[Yester Castle|Yester]], it was originally named '''Lethington'''. It was once home to the Maitland family, notably Sir [[Richard Maitland]], and his son [[William Maitland of Lethington]], Secretary of State to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]'. The Maitlands left Lennoxlove in the seventeenth century, and it is now the seat of the [[Duke of Hamilton and Brandon]].\n\nThe world's earliest surviving records of a lodge of [[Order of Free Gardeners|free gardeners]] come from Haddington, in 1676.<ref>Article:- [http://www.historyshelf.org/shelf/free/02.php Origins of Gardener Societies] at historyshelf.org. (accessed 18 March 2007)</ref>\n\n===St Mary's Collegiate Church===\n[[File:St. Mary's Kirk, Haddington.jpg|thumb|right|St Mary's [[Collegiate Church]], Haddington]]\n{{main|St. Mary's Collegiate Church}}\n[[File:Haddington War Memorial by Pilkington Jackson.jpg|thumb|Haddington War Memorial by Pilkington Jackson]]\n\nThe Parish Church of St Mary's is today part of the [[Church of Scotland]], but includes an [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] chapel, the ''Lauderdale Aisle'', containing the mausoleum of the Maitland [[Earl of Lauderdale|Earls of Lauderdale]]. It is the longest parish church in Scotland and is in regular use for worship and musical events. It is directly adjacent to the River Tyne, beside the twelfth century Nungate Bridge.\n\nThe present building (built with red sandstone from nearby [[Garvald, East Lothian|Garvald]]) was started in 1375 (an earlier St Mary's Church having been destroyed by the English in 1356), and consecrated in 1410, despite building work not being finished until 1487. The church was partially destroyed during the 1548-49 Siege of Haddington that followed the [[Rough Wooing]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and on the advice of [[John Knox]], it was restored \"frae the tower to the West door\". Thus the nave became the church and the choir and transepts were left ruined until the whole church was restored in the 1970s. The Lammermuir [[pipe organ]] was built in 1990.\n\nA set of eight bells hung for full [[change ringing]] was installed for the [[Millennium]].\n\nHaddington War Memorial stands at the west entrance to the churchyard.\n\n===Hailes Castle===\n[[Hailes Castle]] is a mainly fourteenth-century castle about five miles east of Haddington. This castle, which has a fine riverside setting, belonged to the [[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Lord Hailes|Hepburn]] family during the most important centuries of its existence. Since 1926, it has been the subject of a state-sponsored guardianship agreement, which is now under the auspices of Historic Scotland. It is open to the public without charge at all reasonable times.\n\n==Sport and leisure==\nHaddington is home to East Lothian Amateur Boxing Club, the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Haddington Athletic F.C.|Haddington Athletic]] and [[Haddington RFC]], currently playing in Scotland Premiership Division Three.\n\nAt the end of March 2012, the town's library relocated to the John Gray Centre in Lodge Street, an extensively reconstructed and restored complex of historic buildings including the town's former granary. In addition to the lending library the Centre comprises East Lothian Council's Historical Archives, Local History Collections and Reading Room, a new museum of East Lothian (with a temporary exhibition gallery), a computer suite and community room. The Centre is named after a local minister whose bequest of books and money in 1717 gave the town one of the earliest community libraries in Scotland.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Haddington from the air (geograph 3873603).jpg|thumb|right|Haddington from the air]]\n\nHaddington sits 1&nbsp;km south of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] [[dual carriageway]] linking [[Edinburgh]] to [[London]].  The town is currently served by the bus companies [[Borders Buses]], Prentice Coaches, Eve Coaches and [[Lothian Buses#East Coast Buses|East Coast Buses]]. These buses facilitate travel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], and several other towns and villages in [[East Lothian]]. Since the withdrawal of many [[First Scotland East]] services in June 2012, the contracts for the 121 Haddington to [[North Berwick]] and the 123 [[Gifford, East Lothian|Gifford]] Circle passed back to the Haddington-based firm Prentice Coaches. Haddington was once served by a railway branch line which carried passengers for over a century from 1846 to 1949. There has been proposals to reopen or extend a railway line to Haddington to ease road congestion, but nothing has came to fruition in regards to this.<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Hajducki\n  | first = Andrew M.\n  | title = The Haddington, Macmerry and Gifford Branch Lines\n  | publisher = Oakwood Press\n  | page  = 25 & 147\n  | year = 1994\n  | isbn = 0-85361-456-3}}</ref>\n\n===The Railway===\n{{main|Haddington Line}}\n\nThe [[Haddington Line|Haddington railway line]] was a branch from the [[East Coast Main Line]] at [[Longniddry]] and terminated at [[Haddington railway station]] and freight depot in the area between West Road and Hospital Road.  The line was 4.8 miles in length<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Hajducki\n  | first = Andrew M.\n  | title = The Haddington, Macmerry and Gifford Branch Lines\n  | publisher = Oakwood Press\n  | page  = 222\n  | year = 1994\n  | isbn = 0-85361-456-3}}</ref>\nand had stations at Coatyburn Siding and Laverocklaw Siding before terminating in Haddington. The line was opened on 22 June 1846. The branch had only a single track, though bridges and embankments were built to allow for a double track.  Passengers from Haddington were required to alight at Longniddry and change trains in order to travel to Edinburgh.\n\nThe Haddington branch line and station were damaged during the flood of 1948 and though both passenger and freight services were reinstated, [[British Rail]] opted to remove rail services to the public due to competition from bus services and dwindling passenger numbers. Passenger services ended on 29 December 1949. The use of the railway line for freight continued until March 1968.<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Hajducki\n  | first = Andrew M.\n  | title = The Haddington, Macmerry and Gifford Branch Lines\n  | publisher = Oakwood Press\n  | pages  = 171\u20132\n  | year = 1994\n  | isbn = 0-85361-456-3}}</ref>\nThe larger Victorian station building was demolished; a smaller older building, parts of the platform structure, and embankment walls remain.  These are recognisable by their distinctive red-brick appearance, and can be seen from West Road, Somnerfield Court, and the industrial area south of Hospital Road.\n\nThe land occupied by Haddington's railway line is owned by [[East Lothian Council]] and is used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders in the section of the line between Longniddry station and the St Lawrence area of Haddington. The eastern terminus of the line is occupied by industrial units and scrub vegetation.  A campaign to reopen Haddington's railway service is led by the group RAGES (Rail Action Group East of Scotland). Since the closure of the station in the 1940s (isolated as it then was at the western extremity of Haddington), the town has since expanded significantly.  Between 1951 and 1981, the population of the town grew by 54%.<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Baker\n  | first = S.\n  | title = East Lothian Fourth Statistical Account 1945-2000, vol I\n  | publisher = East Lothian Council Library Service\n  | pages  = 51\u20132\n  | year = 2003\n  | isbn = 1-897857-34-9}}</ref>  It remains to be seen whether further expansion of the town will lead to a reinstatement of Haddington's railway line, since there are congestion issues on both the [[East Coast Main Line]] and at [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station]].\n\n==Twin town==\nHaddington has been twinned with [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in France since 1965.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ordnancegazettee03groouoft raw 0284.png|thumb|right|Seal of Haddington town: \"David Dei Gratia Rex Scottorum.

Both are located adjacent to Neilson Park at the southern edge of the town centre. Prior to October 2012, Haddington Infant School was two separate buildings; the main building (built in 1897) and the annex (built in 1965) was located at Victoria Road/Meadowpark and the old St. Mary's Primary School was located at Tynebank Road. Following the discovery of structural defects at the old St Mary's RC Primary School in early-2009, the pupils temporarily attended makeshift classrooms at King's Meadow Primary School until the building was deemed safe again around mid-2009. In April 2011, East Lothian Council decided to build an entirely new school, because both schools would still be left with major problems even after substantial upgrades. A third primary school started construction at Letham Mains in April 2019, to serve the large number of new houses that have been built on the west side of the town from 2016 onwards. Secondary school pupils attend [[Knox Academy]] at Pencaitland Road. The Compass School, an independent fee-paying primary school and nursery, is located on the West Road.\n\nHistorically, the Burgh schools mostly had a good reputation, an exception being under Rev. William Whyte who retained his office despite reports of violence and even death due to his brutal discipline.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=Irene |title=HADDINGTON BURGH SCHOOLS.

In the middle of the town is the [[Tolbooth|Town House]], built in 1748 according to a plan by [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]].  When first built, it inheld a council chamber, jail and sheriff court, to which assembly rooms were added in 1788, and a new clock in 1835. Nearby is the Corn Exchange (1854) and the County Courthouse (1833). Other nearby notable sites include the Jane Welsh Carlyle House, Mitchell's Close and the birthplace of author and government reformer Samuel Smiles on the High Street, marked by a commemorative plaque.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - LOTHIAN AND LINLITQVO - The Lothians Had2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|[[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu's]] map of 1654 showing the area around Haddington.

It developed into the fourth-largest town in Scotland during the [[High Middle Ages]], and later was at the centre of the mid-eighteenth century [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution]].\n\nIn 1641, an Act was passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to encourage the production of fine cloth, and in 1645 an amendment went through stating that the masters and workers of manufactories would be exempt from military service. As a result of this, more factories were established; these included the New Mills. This factory suffered during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]] with the loss of its cloth to [[General Monck]]. A new charter was drawn up in May 1681, and major capital invested in new machinery, but the New Mills had mixed fortunes, inevitably affected by the lack of protectionism for Scottish manufactured cloth. The ''[[Scots Courant]]'' reported in 1712 that New Mills was to be \"rouped\" (auctioned). The property was sold on 16 February 1713 and the machinery and plant on 20 March. The lands of New Mills were purchased by [[Colonel Francis Charteris]] and he changed their name to Amisfield.\n[[File:Riggs at Haddington.jpg|thumb|An illustration from the 1690s showing the runrig system in operation in Haddington]]\nAs the county town of East Lothian, Haddington is the seat of [[East Lothian Council]] with offices located at John Muir House behind Court Street. This building occupies the site of Haddington's twelfth century royal palace and adjoins the former Sheriff Court complex. The town centre is home to a wide range of independent retailers including: a bookshop, two sports shops, a saddlery and country goods specialist, two butchers, a hardware shop, cookware shop and several gift shops alongside several pubs, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Nationwide retailers with a presence in Haddington include: [[Tesco]], [[M&Co]], [[Boots UK|Boots]], [[Aldi]] and [[Co-op Food]]. Besides retail and administration, the town is also home to various law firms and has industrial capacity in the works beside the Tyne at the Victoria Bridge (PureMalt), and around the site of the old station (Lemac), and various smaller industrial units and garages. Haddington is also home to the offices of the local newspaper the ''East Lothian Courier''. There is a farmers' market held on the last Saturday of the month in Court Street.\n\n==Historic core==\nThe town centre largely retains its historic street plan with Court Street, High Street, Market Street and Hardgate defining the edges of the original open triangular medieval market place, divided by a central island of buildings developed from the 16th century onwards on the site of market stalls.<ref>{{cite web |title=zoomable 25 inch O.S. map from 1892 |url=https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=17&lat=55.9563&lon=-2.7797&layers=168&b=3 |website=National Library of Scotland |publisher=Ordnance Survey |accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref> To the north and south the medieval rigg pattern of [[burgage]] plots can still be observed with narrow buildings fronting the main streets and long plots behind stretching back, originally to the line of the old town walls, accessed by small closes and [[pend]]s. The historic importance of the town's relatively unaltered medieval plan and significant survival of historic buildings was recognised as early as the 1950s, with Haddington subject to an Improvement Scheme, Scotland's earliest, which saw many period properties rehabilitated by the Town Council (under the leadership of Frank Tindall as Director of Planning) and a pioneering town colour scheme developed, resulting in the distinctive and colourful townscape seen today. Some comprehensive redevelopment did occur, chiefly around Newton Port and Hardgate to allow for widening of these narrow streets to improve motor traffic flow. This included the demolition of Bothwell Castle<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacGibbon |first1=David |last2=Ross |first2=Thomas |title=The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth century |date=1887 |publisher=D.

Designed by architect Isaac Ware<ref>''The Country Houses, Castles and Mansions of East Lothian,'' by Sonia Baker {{ISBN|978-1-84033-457-9}}</ref> and built of Garvald red freestone for [[Francis Charteris (rake)|Colonel Francis Charteris]], it was described in  ''The Buildings of Scotland'' as \"the most important building of the orthodox [[Palladian]] school in Scotland.\" John Henderson built the walled garden in 1783, and the castellated stable block in 1785. The park in front of the house, possibly landscaped by James Bowie, is today entirely ploughed. A victim of dry rot, the house was demolished in 1928.\n\nAll that remains of Amisfield today are the summer house, walled garden, ice house, chapel, and gates.\n\n[[Lennoxlove House]], a historic thirteenth-century house and estate, lies half a mile south of Haddington. Built by the Giffards of [[Yester Castle|Yester]], it was originally named '''Lethington'''. It was once home to the Maitland family, notably Sir [[Richard Maitland]], and his son [[William Maitland of Lethington]], Secretary of State to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]'. The Maitlands left Lennoxlove in the seventeenth century, and it is now the seat of the [[Duke of Hamilton and Brandon]].\n\nThe world's earliest surviving records of a lodge of [[Order of Free Gardeners|free gardeners]] come from Haddington, in 1676.<ref>Article:- [http://www.historyshelf.org/shelf/free/02.php Origins of Gardener Societies] at historyshelf.org.

It is the longest parish church in Scotland and is in regular use for worship and musical events. It is directly adjacent to the River Tyne, beside the twelfth century Nungate Bridge.\n\nThe present building (built with red sandstone from nearby [[Garvald, East Lothian|Garvald]]) was started in 1375 (an earlier St Mary's Church having been destroyed by the English in 1356), and consecrated in 1410, despite building work not being finished until 1487. The church was partially destroyed during the 1548-49 Siege of Haddington that followed the [[Rough Wooing]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and on the advice of [[John Knox]], it was restored \"frae the tower to the West door\". Thus the nave became the church and the choir and transepts were left ruined until the whole church was restored in the 1970s. The Lammermuir [[pipe organ]] was built in 1990.\n\nA set of eight bells hung for full [[change ringing]] was installed for the [[Millennium]].\n\nHaddington War Memorial stands at the west entrance to the churchyard.\n\n===Hailes Castle===\n[[Hailes Castle]] is a mainly fourteenth-century castle about five miles east of Haddington. This castle, which has a fine riverside setting, belonged to the [[Patrick Hepburn, 1st Lord Hailes|Hepburn]] family during the most important centuries of its existence. Since 1926, it has been the subject of a state-sponsored guardianship agreement, which is now under the auspices of Historic Scotland. It is open to the public without charge at all reasonable times.\n\n==Sport and leisure==\nHaddington is home to East Lothian Amateur Boxing Club, the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Haddington Athletic F.C.|Haddington Athletic]] and [[Haddington RFC]], currently playing in Scotland Premiership Division Three.\n\nAt the end of March 2012, the town's library relocated to the John Gray Centre in Lodge Street, an extensively reconstructed and restored complex of historic buildings including the town's former granary. In addition to the lending library the Centre comprises East Lothian Council's Historical Archives, Local History Collections and Reading Room, a new museum of East Lothian (with a temporary exhibition gallery), a computer suite and community room. The Centre is named after a local minister whose bequest of books and money in 1717 gave the town one of the earliest community libraries in Scotland.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Haddington from the air (geograph 3873603).jpg|thumb|right|Haddington from the air]]\n\nHaddington sits 1&nbsp;km south of the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] [[dual carriageway]] linking [[Edinburgh]] to [[London]].  The town is currently served by the bus companies [[Borders Buses]], Prentice Coaches, Eve Coaches and [[Lothian Buses#East Coast Buses|East Coast Buses]]. These buses facilitate travel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], and several other towns and villages in [[East Lothian]]. Since the withdrawal of many [[First Scotland East]] services in June 2012, the contracts for the 121 Haddington to [[North Berwick]] and the 123 [[Gifford, East Lothian|Gifford]] Circle passed back to the Haddington-based firm Prentice Coaches. Haddington was once served by a railway branch line which carried passengers for over a century from 1846-1949. There has been proposals to reopen or extend a railway line to Haddington to ease road congestion, but nothing has came to fruition in regards to this.<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Hajducki\n  | first = Andrew M.\n  | title = The Haddington, Macmerry and Gifford Branch Lines\n  | publisher = Oakwood Press\n  | page  = 25 & 147\n  | year = 1994\n  | isbn = 0-85361-456-3}}</ref>\n\n===The Railway===\n{{main|Haddington Line}}\n\nThe [[Haddington Line|Haddington railway line]] was a branch from the [[East Coast Main Line]] at [[Longniddry]] and terminated at [[Haddington railway station]] and freight depot in the area between West Road and Hospital Road.  The line was 4.8 miles in length<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Hajducki\n  | first = Andrew M.\n  | title = The Haddington, Macmerry and Gifford Branch Lines\n  | publisher = Oakwood Press\n  | page  = 222\n  | year = 1994\n  | isbn = 0-85361-456-3}}</ref>\nand had stations at Coatyburn Siding and Laverocklaw Siding before terminating in Haddington. The line was opened on 22 June 1846. The branch had only a single track, though bridges and embankments were built to allow for a double track.  Passengers from Haddington were required to alight at Longniddry and change trains in order to travel to Edinburgh.\n\nThe Haddington branch line and station were damaged during the flood of 1948 and though both passenger and freight services were reinstated, [[British Rail]] opted to remove rail services to the public due to competition from bus services and dwindling passenger numbers. Passenger services ended on 29 December 1949. The use of the railway line for freight continued until March 1968.<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Hajducki\n  | first = Andrew M.\n  | title = The Haddington, Macmerry and Gifford Branch Lines\n  | publisher = Oakwood Press\n  | pages  = 171\u20132\n  | year = 1994\n  | isbn = 0-85361-456-3}}</ref>\nThe larger Victorian station building was demolished; a smaller older building, parts of the platform structure, and embankment walls remain.  These are recognisable by their distinctive red-brick appearance, and can be seen from West Road, Somnerfield Court, and the industrial area south of Hospital Road.\n\nThe land occupied by Haddington's railway line is owned by [[East Lothian Council]] and is used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders in the section of the line between Longniddry station and the St Lawrence area of Haddington. The eastern terminus of the line is occupied by industrial units and scrub vegetation.  A campaign to reopen Haddington's railway service is led by the group RAGES (Rail Action Group East of Scotland). Since the closure of the station in the 1940s (isolated as it then was at the western extremity of Haddington), the town has since expanded significantly.  Between 1951-1981, the population of the town grew by 54%.<ref>Book:- {{cite book\n  | last = Baker\n  | first = S.\n  | title = East Lothian Fourth Statistical Account 1945-2000, vol I\n  | publisher = East Lothian Council Library Service\n  | pages  = 51\u20132\n  | year = 2003\n  | isbn = 1-897857-34-9}}</ref>  It remains to be seen whether further expansion of the town will lead to a reinstatement of Haddington's railway line, since there are congestion issues on both the [[East Coast Main Line]] and at [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station]].\n\n==Twin town==\nHaddington has been twinned with [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in France since 1965.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ordnancegazettee03groouoft raw 0284.png|thumb|right|Seal of Haddington town: \"David Dei Gratia Rex Scottorum.

Both are located adjacent to Neilson Park at the southern edge of the town centre. Prior to October 2012, Haddington Infant School was two separate buildings; the main building (built in 1897) and the annex (built in 1965) was located at Victoria Road/Meadowpark and the old St. Mary's Primary School was located at Tynebank Road. Following the discovery of structural defects at the old St Mary's RC Primary School in early-2009, the pupils temporarily attended makeshift classrooms at King's Meadow Primary School until the building was deemed safe again around mid-2009. In April 2011, East Lothian Council decided to build an entirely new school, because both schools would still be left with major problems even after substantial upgrades. A third primary school started construction at Letham Mains in April 2019, to serve the large number of new houses that have been built on the west side of the town from 2016 onwards. Secondary school pupils attend [[Knox Academy]] at Pencaitland Road. The Compass School, an independent fee-paying primary school and nursery, is located on the West Road.\n\nHistorically, the Burgh schools mostly had a good reputation, an exception being under Rev.

The inspectors, usually called \"mounted guards\", operated out of El Paso, Texas. Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as California trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.\n\nIn March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as \"mounted inspectors\". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles, motorcycles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese aliens trying to avoid the National Origins Act and Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigration Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times. U.S. Army soldiers along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to \"the more serious work of military training.\" Aliens encountered illegally in the U.S. by the Army were directed to the immigration inspection stations. Texas Rangers were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as \"singularly effective\".<ref>U.S. Border Patrol, [https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/history], \"Border Patrol History\", October 5th, 2018</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = \n| image1 = Badge of the United States Border Patrol (1924-1940).png\n| width1 = 115\n| alt1 = Badge of the United States Border Patrol, circa 1939.\n| caption1 = Former badge when the agency was under the Dept. of Labor (1920\u20131940)\n| image2 = Badge of the United States Border Patrol (1992-2003).svg\n| width2 = 130\n| alt2 = Badge of the United States Border Patrol, circa 1999.\n| caption2 = The former badge, when the agency was under the Dept. of Justice (1940\u20132003)\n| image3 = Badge of the United States Border Patrol.svg\n| width3 = 130\n| alt3 = Badge of the United States Border Patrol, circa 2013.\n| caption3 = The current badge after the agency became a part Homeland Security (2003\u2013)\n| footer = \n}}\n[[File:BorderPatrol.png|right|thumb|During the 1940 Border Patrol expansion, four newly hired agents from the northeastern states drove this new pursuit vehicle from the Ford factory in Detroit to El Paso where they would receive training.]]\n[[File:2ndThompsonTraining.png|right|thumb|A Border Patrol Agent practice firing a Thompson submachine gun near El Paso in 1940.]]\n\nThe [[National Origins Act]] authorized the formation of the U.S. Border Patrol on May 26, 1924.<ref name=ethnic>Airriess, Christopher A.; ''Contemporary Ethnic Geographies in America'', p.

Mexican border operations were directed from [[El Paso, Texas]], and Canadian border operations were directed from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The Canadian border operations from Detroit employed more men than the El Paso operations along the Mexican border because of a focus on the prevention of liquor smuggling during prohibition. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s Executive Order 6166 formed the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) in 1933 by consolidation of the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization. Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, Border Patrol staffing doubled to 1,500 in 1940, and the INS was moved from the Department of Labor to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.borderpatrolmuseum.com/history/border-patrol-history.html|title=A History of the United States Border Patrol |publisher=National Border Patrol Museum|accessdate=April 10, 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908070136/http://borderpatrolmuseum.com/history/border-patrol-history.html |archivedate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] during the 1960s after Fidel Castro triumphed in the [[Cuban Revolution]] and that was followed by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. INS was decommissioned in March 2003 when its operations were divided between [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]], and [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].\n\nIn the wake of the attacks of September 11, the Border Patrol was placed under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, and preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States was added to its mission. The Border Patrol's traditional mission continued: deterring, detecting and apprehending illegal aliens and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who generally entered the United States at places other than through designated [[ports of entry]].

In 1986, the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal aliens. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal aliens to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as \"employer sanctions\". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the [[Livermore Sector (U.S. Border Patrol)|Livermore Sector]] in Northern California.\n\nEmployer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed [[Proposition 187]], denying benefits to illegal aliens and criminalizing illegal aliens in possession of forged green cards, identification cards, and Social Security numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal aliens to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]]. Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.\n\n====Checkpoint stations====\n[[United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints]] are inspection stations operated by the USBP within {{convert|100|mi}} of an international border (with Mexico or Canada) or any U.S. coastline, or in the [[Florida Keys]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tina|last=Starr|title=Local man's film highlights plight of migrant farm workers|url=https://www.vermontfolklifecenter.org/exhibits-feed/the-golden-cage |location=Barton, Vermont|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line====\n[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] Sector Chief Patrol Agent [[Silvestre Reyes]] started a program called \"Operation Hold the Line\". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to [[illegal entry|illegal entries]] resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the [[Rio Grande]], within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n====San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper====\n[[File:Border patrol at the beach, San Diego county.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling the beach in San Diego County, California]]\nCongressman [[Duncan L.

Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, illegal aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor, television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\nTraffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics.<ref name=\"overview\" />\n\nTransportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft.<ref name=\"overview\" />\n\nMarine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components.<ref name=\"overview\" />\n\nHorse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch.<ref name=\"overview\" /> Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Detroit - Inside Greyhound Bus Station - P1080197.JPG|thumb|right|U.S. Border Patrol Agents at the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus station in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] in February 2011.

In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%.  The 18% attrition was largely attributed to agents transferring to the [[Federal Air Marshals]] after [[9/11]]. Since that time the attrition rate has decreased. Congress increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from a [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|GS-9 rate to a GS-11 rate]] in 2002.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber). Up until 1994 the Border Patrol issued its Patrol Agents a .357 Magnum revolver as their duty sidearm, a [[Smith & Wesson]] or [[Ruger]] model large frame, six shot revolver.  The Border Patrol preferred this weapon because it did not jam in harsh conditions, like those of the southwestern border, and also because of the strong \"[[stopping power]]\" of the .357 Magnum cartridge. Although up until 1994 Patrol Agents could purchase a weapon from the agency list of approved authorized personal weapons for duty carry. This list included the Glock Models 17 and 19 pistols in 9mm, the [[SIG Sauer P220]] pistol in .45 ACP caliber, the [[Colt Python]] .357 Magnum revolver, and the [[Smith & Wesson Model 19|Smith & Wesson Model 19/66]] .357 Magnum revolver. The Border Patrol adopted the [[Beretta 92|Beretta Model 96D]], a .40 S&W caliber semi-automatic pistol (modified for Double-Action Only) (with 11-round capacity magazines) as its duty issue sidearm in 1995.  The .40 S&W caliber jacketed hollow-point cartridge was adopted because of its excellent \"stopping\" power and its superior ballistic characteristics over the 9mm cartridge. In late 2006 the H&K P2000 pistol was adopted as the Border Patrol's primary duty sidearm.  The H&K Model USP Compact pistol, H&K Model P2000SK (sub-compact) and Beretta M96D .40 S&W caliber pistols are authorized as secondary sidearms.\n\nOn April 9, 2019, CBP announced that the U.S. Border Patrol would transition from the .40 caliber H&K P2000 to an unnamed 9-millimeter Glock pistol, by the end of fiscal year 2021.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-awards-contract-duty-handguns |title = CBP Awards Contract for Duty Handguns &#124; U.S. Customs and Border Protection}}</ref>  It has since been revealed that the three [[Glock]] handguns that would be issued to CBP officers and agents would be the model G26, model G19, and the specifically manufactured for CBP model G47.<ref>https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/gearscout/irons/2019/04/12/shhhglock-just-released-a-new-glock-without-really-saying-anything-g47/</ref>\n\n[[File:Border Patrol Agent in Nogales, Arizona.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling a tunnel in [[Nogales, Arizona]].]]\n\nLike many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[Remington Model 870]] is the standard pump-action shotgun. The Border Patrol issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to Border Patrol specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical \"ghost-ring\" rear sight. The old Border Patrol \"anti-bandit\" units used to use a 12-gauge, semi-automatic shotgun with a sawed-off barrel. This weapon had the designated name of a \"Sidewinder.\"  The USBP anti-bandit units were decommissioned in the late 1980s.\n\nBorder Patrol agents also commonly carry the [[.223 Remington|.223]] caliber Colt [[M4 Carbine|M4 Carbine (Specifically the updated M4A1)]] and the [[H&K UMP]] .40 caliber [[submachine gun]]. The [[.308 Winchester|.308]] caliber [[M14 rifle]] is used for ceremonial purposes and by agents who are qualified with the rifle and [[BORTAC]].\n\nAs less than lethal options, the Border Patrol uses the FN 303 Launcher.  The FN 303 fires plastic pellet balls containing OC (Oleoresin Capsicum) Pepper dust.  The plastic pellet balls burst on impact spraying the suspect with OC Pepper dust and also act as an impact projectile. The Border Patrol also issues its agents OC Pepper spray canisters, tasers and a collapsible/telescopic (or telescoping) steel police baton.\n\n===Transportation===\n\n[[File:U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Riverine Unit Patrols Rio Grande River Border in Air-Boat.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling the [[Rio Grande]] in an [[airboat]] at [[Laredo, Texas]], 2013.]]\n[[File:Office of CBP Air and Marine helicopter and boats.jpg|right|thumb|Helicopter and boats]]\n[[File:South Texas, Border Patrol Agents, McAllen Horse Patrol Unit.jpg|thumb|right|A USBP Horse Patrol in southern Texas.]]\nUnlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates over 10,000 [[SUV]]s and pickup trucks, which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. These vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens and/or have their bumpers removed or have off-road suspension and tires. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] or the [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Police package version|Dodge Charger]] as patrol cars or high speed \"interceptors\" on highways. The U.S. Border Patrol has approximately 2,000 sedans. The Border Patrol also operates all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and small boats in riverine environments.\n\nIn 2005, all Border Patrol and ICE aircraft operations were combined under CBP's [[Office of Air and Marine]].  All CBP vessel operations within the Customs Waters and on the high seas are conducted by Marine Interdiction Agents of the Office of Air and Marine.\n\nColor schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle (older vehicles) or a broad green diagonal stripe (newer vehicles) on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white. During the 1960s to mid-1980s Border Patrol vehicles were painted a light green.\n\nThe Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. {{As of|2005}}, the U.S. Border Patrol has 205 horses. Most are employed along the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. In [[Arizona]], these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.<ref>{{Cite news\n|url=http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/1731|title=Border Patrol horses get special feed that helps protect desert ecosystem |author=Rostien, Arthur H.|newspaper=Environmental News Network|date=June 9, 2005|accessdate=June 1, 2009|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903075838/http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/1731|archivedate=September 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Killed in the line of duty==\nSince 1904, the Border Patrol has lost 123 officers in the line of duty, more than any other federal law enforcement agency during that time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/agency/4830-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-customs-and-border-protection-united-states-border-patrol-us-government|title=United States Department of Homeland Security \u2013 Customs and Border Protection \u2013 Border Patrol|publisher=Officer Down Memorial Page|accessdate=June 24, 2018|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504052750/http://www.odmp.org/agency/4830-united-states-department-of-homeland-security---customs-and-border-protection---border-patrol-u.s.-government|archivedate=May 4, 2011}} Note: The [[United States Marshals Service]] has suffered more ''total'' line of duty deaths, though over a longer time period (see {{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/agency/3955-united-states-department-of-justice-united-states-marshals-service-us-government |title=United States Department of Justice - United States Marshals Service, US |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053726/http://www.odmp.org/agency/3955-united-states-department-of-justice-united-states-marshals-service-us-government |archivedate=September 21, 2013}}).}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The inspectors, usually called \"mounted guards\", operated out of El Paso, Texas. Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as California trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.\n\nIn March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as \"mounted inspectors\". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles, motorcycles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese aliens trying to avoid the National Origins Act and Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigration Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times.

The Canadian border operations from Detroit employed more men than the El Paso operations along the Mexican border because of a focus on the prevention of liquor smuggling during prohibition. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s Executive Order 6166 formed the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS) in 1933 by consolidation of the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization. Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, Border Patrol staffing doubled to 1,500 in 1940, and the INS was moved from the Department of Labor to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.borderpatrolmuseum.com/history/border-patrol-history.html|title=A History of the United States Border Patrol |publisher=National Border Patrol Museum|accessdate=April 10, 2013|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908070136/http://borderpatrolmuseum.com/history/border-patrol-history.html |archivedate=September 8, 2013}}</ref> Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] during the 1960s after Fidel Castro triumphed in the [[Cuban Revolution]] and that was followed by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].

In 1986, the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal aliens. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal aliens to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as \"employer sanctions\". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the [[Livermore Sector (U.S. Border Patrol)|Livermore Sector]] in Northern California.\n\nEmployer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed [[Proposition 187]], denying benefits to illegal aliens and criminalizing illegal aliens in possession of forged green cards, identification cards, and Social Security numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal aliens to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]]. Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.\n\n====Checkpoint stations====\n[[United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints]] are inspection stations operated by the USBP within {{convert|100|mi}} of an international border (with Mexico or Canada) or any U.S. coastline, or in the [[Florida Keys]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tina|last=Starr|title=Local man's film highlights plight of migrant farm workers|url=https://www.vermontfolklifecenter.org/exhibits-feed/the-golden-cage |location=Barton, Vermont|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line====\n[[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] Sector Chief Patrol Agent [[Silvestre Reyes]] started a program called \"Operation Hold the Line\". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to [[illegal entry|illegal entries]] resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the [[Rio Grande]], within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n====San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper====\n[[File:Border patrol at the beach, San Diego county.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling the beach in San Diego County, California]]\nCongressman [[Duncan L.

Border Patrol Agent Trainees are instructed in courses including; Spanish, criminal law, nationality law, and administrative immigration law, police sciences, self-defense and arrest techniques, firearms training with pistol, shotgun and rifle, police vehicle driving, and other Border Patrol / federal law enforcement subjects.\n\nOnce they arrive back at their duty station, Trainees then must graduate from the Field Training Officer (FTO) program, an on-the-job training program, which varies in length from a minimum of 12 weeks to a maximum of over 16 weeks long, depending on the practical demands of the duty station and local management.  They must also successfully complete the Post Academy Training Program, an extension of the Border Patrol Academy where Trainees complete additional classroom-based training over the course of their first nine months back at their duty station.\n\n==Appearance==\n===Uniforms===\nThe Border Patrol, c. 2007, wore the following types of uniforms:\n[[File:CBP Officers pay tribute 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A color guard composed of CBP officers and USBP agents at a Washington, D.C. ceremony in May 2007.]]\n*Summer Dress uniform \u2013 The summer dress uniform consists of a short-sleeve, olive-green dress shirt (which may or may not have blue shoulder straps), brass [[nameplate]], badge, olive-green [[slacks]] with a blue stripe running the length of the seam, and black dress shoes or dress boots. A green, straw [[campaign hat]] is worn with this uniform.\n* Winter Dress uniform \u2013 The winter dress uniform consists of a long-sleeve, olive green dress shirt, navy-blue [[clip-on tie]] with a brass [[tie tack]], olive-green [[ike jacket]] with blue accents (shoulder straps and cuffs), brass nameplate, badge, olive-green slacks with a blue stripe running the length of the seam, and black dress shoes or dress boots. a green, felt [[campaign hat]] with a black, leather [[hat band]] is worn with this uniform.\n*Ceremonial Dress uniform \u2013 Worn primarily by border patrol [[Guard of honour|honor guard]] agents, the ceremonial dress uniform is roughly identical to the winter dress uniform, with the exception that a [[tunic]] is worn with this uniform, rather than an ike jacket. White, cloth gloves are also worn with this uniform. \n* Rough duty uniform \u2013 The rough duty uniform consists of a green, long-sleeve or short-sleeve work shirt, green [[cargo pants]], and black work boots; a green [[baseball cap]]  or [[cowboy hat]] is typically worn with this uniform.\n**There are also specialized rough duty uniforms for marine patrol (riverine), northern border cold weather, horse patrol and bike patrol agents.\n* Highland Uniform \u2013 Worn by members of the United States Border Patrol Pipes and Drums in the performance of their official duties, this uniform includes a kilt made of the official Border Patrol Tartan, custom made ceremonial coat, glengarry, sporran and spats.\n* Organization patches \u2013 The Border Patrol wears two:\n** The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber). Up until 1994 the Border Patrol issued its Patrol Agents a .357 Magnum revolver as their duty sidearm, a [[Smith & Wesson]] or [[Ruger]] model large frame, six shot revolver.  The Border Patrol preferred this weapon because it did not jam in harsh conditions, like those of the southwestern border, and also because of the strong \"[[stopping power]]\" of the .357 Magnum cartridge. Although up until 1994 Patrol Agents could purchase a weapon from the agency list of approved authorized personal weapons for duty carry. This list included the Glock Models 17 and 19 pistols in 9mm, the [[SIG Sauer P220]] pistol in .45 ACP caliber, the [[Colt Python]] .357 Magnum revolver, and the [[Smith & Wesson Model 19|Smith & Wesson Model 19/66]] .357 Magnum revolver. The Border Patrol adopted the [[Beretta 92|Beretta Model 96D]], a .40 S&W caliber semi-automatic pistol (modified for Double-Action Only) (with 11-round capacity magazines) as its duty issue sidearm in 1995.  The .40 S&W caliber jacketed hollow-point cartridge was adopted because of its excellent \"stopping\" power and its superior ballistic characteristics over the 9mm cartridge. In late 2006 the H&K P2000 pistol was adopted as the Border Patrol's primary duty sidearm.  The H&K Model USP Compact pistol, H&K Model P2000SK (sub-compact) and Beretta M96D .40 S&W caliber pistols are authorized as secondary sidearms.\n\nOn April 9, 2019, CBP announced that the U.S. Border Patrol would transition from the .40 caliber H&K P2000 to an unnamed 9-millimeter Glock pistol, by the end of fiscal year 2021.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-awards-contract-duty-handguns |title = CBP Awards Contract for Duty Handguns &#124; U.S. Customs and Border Protection}}</ref>  It has since been revealed that the three [[Glock]] handguns that would be issued to CBP officers and agents would be the model G26, model G19, and the specifically manufactured for CBP model G47.<ref>https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/gearscout/irons/2019/04/12/shhhglock-just-released-a-new-glock-without-really-saying-anything-g47/</ref>\n\n[[File:Border Patrol Agent in Nogales, Arizona.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling a tunnel in [[Nogales, Arizona]].]]\n\nLike many other law enforcement agencies, the 12 [[gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] [[Remington Model 870]] is the standard pump-action shotgun. The Border Patrol issue Model 870 has been modified by Scattergun Technologies to Border Patrol specifications including: a 14-inch barrel, a five-shot capacity magazine, a composite stock with pistol grip, and night sights with a tactical \"ghost-ring\" rear sight. The old Border Patrol \"anti-bandit\" units used to use a 12-gauge, semi-automatic shotgun with a sawed-off barrel. This weapon had the designated name of a \"Sidewinder.\"  The USBP anti-bandit units were decommissioned in the late 1980s.\n\nBorder Patrol agents also commonly carry the [[.223 Remington|.223]] caliber Colt [[M4 Carbine|M4 Carbine (Specifically the updated M4A1)]] and the [[H&K UMP]] .40 caliber [[submachine gun]]. The [[.308 Winchester|.308]] caliber [[M14 rifle]] is used for ceremonial purposes and by agents who are qualified with the rifle and [[BORTAC]].\n\nAs less than lethal options, the Border Patrol uses the FN 303 Launcher.  The FN 303 fires plastic pellet balls containing OC (Oleoresin Capsicum) Pepper dust.  The plastic pellet balls burst on impact spraying the suspect with OC Pepper dust and also act as an impact projectile. The Border Patrol also issues its agents OC Pepper spray canisters, tasers and a collapsible/telescopic (or telescoping) steel police baton.\n\n===Transportation===\n\n[[File:U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Riverine Unit Patrols Rio Grande River Border in Air-Boat.jpg|thumb|right|Patrolling the [[Rio Grande]] in an [[airboat]] at [[Laredo, Texas]], 2013.]]\n[[File:Office of CBP Air and Marine helicopter and boats.jpg|right|thumb|Helicopter and boats]]\n[[File:South Texas, Border Patrol Agents, McAllen Horse Patrol Unit.jpg|thumb|right|A USBP Horse Patrol in southern Texas.]]\nUnlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates over 10,000 [[SUV]]s and pickup trucks, which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. These vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens and/or have their bumpers removed or have off-road suspension and tires. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]] or the [[Dodge Charger (LX)#Police package version|Dodge Charger]] as patrol cars or high speed \"interceptors\" on highways. The U.S. Border Patrol has approximately 2,000 sedans. The Border Patrol also operates all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and small boats in riverine environments.\n\nIn 2005, all Border Patrol and ICE aircraft operations were combined under CBP's [[Office of Air and Marine]].  All CBP vessel operations within the Customs Waters and on the high seas are conducted by Marine Interdiction Agents of the Office of Air and Marine.\n\nColor schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle (older vehicles) or a broad green diagonal stripe (newer vehicles) on the door.

{"title_page": "Indian Trade", "text_new": "{{about|Native American trade|the country of India|List of the largest trading partners of India}}\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Fur trade|Fur trading]] at Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s in 1841.]]\nThe '''Native American Trade''' refers to historic [[trade]] between Europeans and their North American descendants and the [[Indigenous people of North America]] (today known as [[Native Americans in the United States]], and [[First Nations in Canada]], but formerly as \"Indians\"), beginning before the colonial period and continuing through the 19th century, although declining it around 1937.\n\nThe term Indian Trade describes the people involved in the trade. The products involved varied by region and era. In most of Canada the term is synonymous with the [[fur trade in North America|fur trade]], since fur for making [[beaver hats]] was by far the most valuable product of the trade, from the European point of view. Demand for other products resulted in trade in those items: Europeans asked for [[deerskin trade|deerskin]] in the Southeast coast of the United States, and for [[American bison|buffalo]] skins and meat, and [[pemmican]] on the [[Great Plains]]. In turn, Native American  demand influenced the trade goods brought by Europeans.\n\nEconomic contact between Native Americans and European colonists began in the during the early stages of European settlement. From the 17th to the 19th century, the [[English people|English]] and [[French people|French]] mainly traded for animal pelts and fur with Native Americans.<ref>Vaughan 1929, p.215</ref> On the other hand, trading between the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Native Americans was sporadic and lasted only for a couple of decades.<ref>Pritzker 1998, p.102</ref>  Eventually, wars, the dwindling of Native American populations and the westward expansion of the [[United States]] led to the confinement of tribes to reservations and the end of this kind of economic relations between Indians and European Americans.\n\nOther economic relations continued, extremely in the alcohol trade around many reservations, and for Native American arts and crafts that are now sown for everyone to see. Today, many Native Americans satisfy a different kind of demand with the associated trades of their gaming casinos on foreign land. These have been developed as entertainment and conference resorts, serving a wide market of customers, and generating substantial revenues for tribes to use for economic development, as well as welfare and education of their people.\n\nThe first explorers to conduct trade with Native Americans were [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]] in the 1520s-1540s. Verrazzano noted in his book, \"If we wanted to trade with them for some of their things, they would come to the seashore on some rocks where the breakers were most violent while we remained on the little boat, and they sent us what they wanted to give on a rope, continually shouting to us not to approach the land.\" <ref>Dolin 2010, p.9</ref> As visits from Europeans became more frequent and some Europeans began to settle in North America, Indians began to establish regular trade relations with these new colonists. The ideal locations for fur trading were near harbors where ships could come in.\n\n==Trade with early European settlers==\n'''Plymouth and Jamestown'''\n\nIn order to set up a thriving colony, settlers in the New World needed the five factors of production that contribute to the creation of wealth: land (natural resources), labor, capital, entrepreneurship and knowledge.  Often, trading with Native Americans resulted in colonists gaining needed knowledge and natural resources. Examples of this can be seen in the English settlements of Plymouth Bay and Jamestown. [[Chief Massasoit]], a Wampanoag, and [[Squanto]], a Patuxet Indian, helped the [[Pilgrims]] of [[Plymouth Bay]] establish their colony by teaching them skills in cultivating this land and hunting.<ref>Vaughan 1929, p.68</ref> In return for weapons and tools, these Native Americans provided the colonists with important natural resources, including food.<ref>Vaughan 1929, p.68</ref>  In 1621 Chief Massasoit established one of the earliest trading pacts between Europeans and Indians by signing a treaty with Plymouth Colony to engage in peaceful trade.<ref>Vaughan 1929, p.73</ref> As the number of English colonists in the [[New England]] area began to grow, the Wampanoag became uneasy of losing their land to these new settlers. Gradually, tensions escalated, leading to [[King Philip's War]], an armed conflict between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans in the area. The war ended with the defeat of the Indian tribe, causing a serious fracture amongst relations between the Pilgrims and Native Americans.<ref>Vaughan 1929, p.320</ref>\n\nRelations between settlers in the Jamestown area and Native Americans ended similarly. Initially, the Powahatan aided the English settlers with food and clothing, helping them survive the early difficult years. However, relations between the two groups deteriorated after three years, resulting in a war.\n\n'''Fur trading posts'''\n\nFur trading was one of the main economic activities in Northern America from the late 16th century to the mid-19th century. At the time, demand for fur was surging in Europe as it was used to make cloth and fancy hats.  Data collected from England in the 18th century highlights that the years from 1746 to 1763 saw an increase of 12 shillings per pelt. It has been calculated that over 20 million beaver hats were exported from England alone from 1700 to 1770.<ref>Carlos</ref> Both trading partners, Native Americans and Europeans, provided the other a comparative advantage in the fur trade industry. The opportunity cost of hunting beavers in Europe was extremely high: by the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Eurasian beaver was near extinction in England and France.<ref>Carlos</ref> On the other hand, traders and trappers thought the wildlife in the New World was essentially limitless. Native Americans made use of the trade goods received, particularly knives, axes, and guns. The fur trade provided a stable source of income for many Native Americans until the mid-19th century, when changing fashion trends in Europe and a decline in the beaver population in North America brought about a collapse in demand for fur.<ref>Carlos</ref>\n\n'''Trade with the Spanish'''\nTrading between Spanish settlers and Native Americans was rare and occurred in parts of New Mexico and California. The Spanish mainly intended to spread the Christian faith to Indians and to establish encomienda. The most significant effect of trading with the Spanish was the introduction of the horse to the [[Ute people|Ute]] in New Mexico. Gradually, horses bred and their use was adopted across the Great Plains, dramatically altering the lifestyles and customs of many Native American tribes. Many Indians switched from a hunter- gatherer economy to a nomadic lifestyle after they began using horses for transportation. They had a greater range for hunting bison and trading with other tribes.<ref>Pritzker, 88</ref>\n\n'''Relationship between Europeans and Indians'''\nIt took time for Europeans and Native Americans to learn the customs of the other side. When Europeans first encountered a tribe, they would often be offered fur, food or other items as gifts. The Europeans did not understand they were supposed to take on an alliance with the natives, including helping them against their enemies. Native American tribes regularly practice gift giving as part of their social relations. Because the Europeans did not (or most of them), they were considered to be rude and crude.\n\nAfter observing that Europeans wanted to trade goods for the skins and other items, Native Americans entered into that. Both sides became involved in the conflicts of the other. In New France, in Carolina, Virginia, and New England and in New Netherland, the Europeans became drawn into the endemic warfare of their trading partners. As Native Americans were pressed into alliances by the Europeans for Queen Anne's War, the Seven Years' War, the Nine Years' War, and other standing competitions among the European powers: France, Great Britain and Spain, with whom they were dealing in North America, they felt drawn into the Europeans' endemic warfare.\n\n[[File:Pima baskets.jpg|thumb|left|Practical within their own cultures, decorative baskets were also important trade items for many tribes.

Later the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Office]], which was then part of the War Department, issued licenses to traders in the [[Indian Territory]]. Under removal, the largest tribes from the Southeast and north of the Ohio were moved west of the Mississippi river. By 1834 Indian Territory had been designated as what was then most of the United States west of the Mississippi, primarily what became Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma. Territories of the upper West were still occupied by native tribes as well. Mountain men and traders from Mexico freely operated there independently of the US.\n\nAfter the formation of the United States, the commerce clause of the constitution gave Congress the power to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.\" In the 19th century, the American government passed legislation to support relocation of tribes to reservations in order to extinguish their title to lands that could be sold to European Americans. The [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]] forced tribes such as the Cherokee and the Choctaw to move out of their homelands.<ref>Perdue</ref> Resistance by Native Americans to relocate resulted in conflicts such as the [[Second Seminole War]], that caused the deaths of 3000 Native Americans. Forcing tribes to relocate and to adjust to isolated reservations often unsuitable for the subsistence farming they were encouraged to undertake, made many of them dependent on the U.S. government for annuities and supplies. They had difficulty trying to develop economic systems of their own.<ref>Perdue</ref>\n\nAs outlined by Kalt and Cornell in their book, ''What Can Tribes Do? Strategies and Institutions in American Indian Economic Development,'' on reservations, tribes lacked access to capital, were assigned to areas with poor natural resources (or had their resources stolen or kept from their control), and did not possess skilled labor.\n\nToday, many programs, such as the [[Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development]], exist to foster conditions that will help reservations become independent and financially stable communities. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have established gaming casinos. The most successful ones use part of the revenues for economic development of their nations, as well as for welfare and education for all their tribal members.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Vaughan, A.

The products involved varied by region and era. In most of Canada the term is synonymous with the [[fur trade in North America|fur trade]], since fur for making [[beaver hats]] was by far the most valuable product of the trade, from the European point of view. Demand for other products resulted in trade in those items: Europeans asked for [[deerskin trade|deerskin]] in the Southeast coast of the United States, and for [[American bison|buffalo]] skins and meat, and [[pemmican]] on the [[Great Plains]]. In turn, Native American  demand influenced the trade goods brought by Europeans.\n\nEconomic contact between Native Americans and European colonists began in the during the early stages of European settlement. From the 17th to the 19th century, the [[English people|English]] and [[French people|French]] mainly traded for animal pelts and fur with Native Americans.<ref>Vaughan 1929, p.215</ref> On the other hand, trading between the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Native Americans was sporadic and lasted only for a couple of decades.<ref>Pritzker 1998, p.102</ref>  Eventually, wars, the dwindling of Native American populations and the westward expansion of the [[United States]] led to the confinement of tribes to reservations and the end of this kind of economic relations between Indians and European Americans.\n\nOther economic relations continued, extremely in the alcohol trade around many reservations, and for Native American arts and crafts that are now sown for everyone to see. Today, many Native Americans satisfy a different kind of demand with the associated trades of their gaming casinos on foreign land. These have been developed as entertainment and conference resorts, serving a wide market of customers, and generating substantial revenues for tribes to use for economic development, as well as welfare and education of their people.\n\nThe first explorers to conduct trade with Native Americans were [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]] in the 1520s-1540s.
