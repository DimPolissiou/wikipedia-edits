Shot almost entirely in black and white, the film follows two journeys made thirty years apart by the indigenous shaman Karamakate in the Colombian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian jungle]], one with Theo, a German ethnographer, and the other with Evan, an American botanist, both of whom are searching for the rare plant ''yakruna''. It was inspired by the travel diaries of [[Theodor Koch-Grunberg]] and [[Richard Evans Schultes]], and dedicated to lost Amazonian cultures.\n\n''Embrace of the Serpent'' was premiered on 15 May 2015 during the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the Art Cinema Award. The film was released in Colombia on 21 May 2015, and worldwide over the course of the following twelve months. It has received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the cinematography and the story's impact of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and way of life by white colonialism. It has won numerous awards, including the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the Grand Jury Prize for Best Picture at the 2017 [[Riviera International Film Festival]], and seven awards at the [[3rd Platino Awards]] to recognise the best Ibero-American films of 2015, including the [[Platino Award for Best Ibero-American Film]]. In 2016 the film was submitted as Colombia's entry for the category of [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]] and was included among the final five nominees, becoming the first Colombian film ever to receive a nomination for an Academy Award.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film tells two stories thirty years apart, both featuring Karamakate, an Amazonian [[shaman]] and last survivor of his tribe. He travels with two scientists, firstly with the German Theo von Martius in 1909 and then with an American named Evan in 1940, to look for the rare ''[[Psychotria viridis|yakruna]]'', a sacred plant.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jordan |last=Hoffman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/17/embrace-of-the-serpent-review-ciro-guerra-colombian-amazon |title=Embrace of the Serpent review \u2013 dreamlike exploration of the Amazon's imperialist pollution |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 February 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nTheo, an ethnographer from [[T\u00fcbingen]] who has already been residing in the Amazon for several years, is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local named Manduca whom he had saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation. Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called \"the sun's semen\" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from [[virola]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Christina |last=Pratt |title=An Encyclopedia of Shamanism \u2013 Volume 2: N\u2013Z |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing|Rosen Publishing Group]] |page=423 |date=1 June 2007 |isbn=978-1-40421-141-4}}</ref>) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money. Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.\n\nMany years later an American botanist, Evan (Brionne Davis), paddles up to a much older Karamakate (Antonio Bol\u00edvar) who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide had sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his [[chullachaqui]], a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]]s, since the United States's supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.\n\nBoth expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a sadistic, lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any \"pagan\" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] figure who believes he is the Messiah. He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the [[Biblical Magi]], but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife. By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes.\n\nIn 1909, we are left with Theo, sick and having fled the Mission, arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the [[Amazon rubber boom]], where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men, and cultivated, against local traditions. Karamakate is furious and destroys it. In 1940, Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome-shaped mountains ([[Cerros de Mavecure]]), allegedly the home of yakruna. He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant \u2013 he has destroyed all the others \u2013 and prepares it for Evan. The preparation being hallucinogenic, aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience. While most of the film is in black-and-white, a part of this experience is shown in colour to signify its intensity. The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies.\n\n== Cast ==\nIn ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' magazine, the film's writer and director [[Ciro Guerra]] noted how the process of finding an actor who can successfully communicate the film's narrative was considered to be a difficult task. After his attempt in reaching out to a variety of indigenous people, it had come to his attention that the older generation were completely detached from the time depicted within the film. Through watching a film over 10 years ago in a workshop with the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]], Guerra was able to find the perfect actor, Nilbio Torres. Torres's two minute presence in the short film had a great impact on Guerra, encouraging him to pursue appointing him the role of Karamakate as \"There was nobody else that could play this guy. He's one of the last Ocaina people remaining. There's only about sixteen of them left.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Guill\u00e9n |url=https://www.cineaste.com/spring2016/embrace-of-the-serpent-ciro-guerra |title=Embrace of the Serpent: An Interview with Ciro Guerra |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |volume=41 |number=2 |date=Spring 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe chemistry between the two explorers was undoubtedly a perfect fit for the film. [[Richard Evans Schultes]] was an admired figure by many, he also had an eerie side to him that Guerra wanted to delve further into. Therefore, by pairing him with [[Brionne Davis]], it highlighted the parallels between the two characters. The two actors spent a lot of time with another during the production of the film  the relationship between the two strengthened greatly. Davis's virtuous presentation is made use of and then subverted as a means of playing with the audience's emotions and trust, a key feature prevalent throughout the film.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe cast are as follows:\n\n*Nilbio Torres as Young Karamakate\n*Antonio Bol\u00edvar as Old Karamakate\n*Jan Bijvoet as Theo\n*[[Brionne Davis]] as Evan\n*Luigi Sciamanna as Gaspar\n*Yauenk\u00fc Migue as Manduca\n*Nicol\u00e1s Cancino as Anizetto\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film explores the representation of the first people nations of the Amazon.

The black and white cinematography bears similarity to the [[daguerreotype]] photography of early twentieth century explorers who initially documented the Amazon and inspired the film.<ref name=\"Alphaville\" />\n\n== Production ==\nBefore production started, the director spent two and a half years researching the Colombian Amazon. They discovered a part of the jungle in the north west that had not yet been heavily affected by tourism or commerce and after gaining permission from the local community, they decided on the location.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Adam |last=Woodward |url=https://lwlies.com/articles/embrace-of-the-serpent-ciro-guerra-heart-of-darkness/ |title=Tropical malady \u2013 making a film in the heart of darkness |magazine=[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]] |date=8 June 2016 |accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref> The pre-production and shooting took place over the course of three months with the help of around 40 people from outside the Amazon and 60 people from indigenous communities within the Amazon. The director extensively collaborated with the community and invited them to participate and collaborate both in front and behind the camera. To avoid any problems caused by the harsh environment, the indigenous people taught the crew how to work with the jungle and performed rituals for spiritual protection. Because of this, there were no accidents or illnesses and the shooting ran smoothly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wd7k74/embrace-of-the-serpent-is-a-violent-psychedelic-film-about-the-colonization-of-the-amazon|title='Embrace of the Serpent' Is a Violent, Psychedelic, Film About the Colonisation of the Amazon|last=Salas|first=Camilo|date=8 January 2016|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Guerra let the indigenous people translate the script, during which they redrafted parts to make it more accurate.<ref name=\"Alphaville\">{{cite journal |last=Berghahn |first=Daniela |title=Encounters with Cultural Difference: Cosmopolitanism and Exoticism in ''Tanna'' (Martin Butler and Bentley Dean, 2015) and ''Embrace of the Serpent'' (Ciro Guerra, 2015) |url=http://www.alphavillejournal.com/Issue14/ArticleBerghahn.pdf |journal=Alphaville: Journal of Film and Screen Media |number=14 |pages=16\u201340 |date=Winter 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cerros de Mavecure (Guain\u00eda, Colombia).JPG|thumb|Cerro Mono and Cerro Pajarito, in the [[Cerros de Mavecure|Mavicure Hills]], which feature in the film.]]\n''Embrace of the Serpent'' was filmed in the [[Amazon natural region|Amazon\u00eda region]] of Colombia.

Shot almost entirely in black and white, the film follows two journeys made thirty years apart by the indigenous shaman Karamakate in the Colombian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian jungle]], one with Theo, a German ethnographer, and the other with Evan, an American botanist, both of whom are searching for the rare plant ''yakruna''. It was inspired by the travel diaries of [[Theodor Koch-Grunberg]] and [[Richard Evans Schultes]], and dedicated to lost Amazonian cultures.\n\n''Embrace of the Serpent'' was premiered on 15 May 2015 during the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the Art Cinema Award. The film was released in Colombia on 21 May 2015, and worldwide over the course of the following twelve months. It has received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the cinematography and the story's impact of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and way of life by white colonialism. It has won numerous awards, including the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the Grand Jury Prize for Best Picture at the 2017 [[Riviera International Film Festival]], and seven awards at the [[3rd Platino Awards]] to recognise the best Ibero-American films of 2015, including the [[Platino Award for Best Ibero-American Film]]. In 2016 the film was submitted as Colombia's entry for the category of [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]] and was included among the final five nominees, becoming the first Colombian film ever to receive a nomination for an Academy Award.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film tells two stories thirty years apart, both featuring Karamakate, an Amazonian [[shaman]] and last survivor of his tribe. He travels with two scientists, firstly with the German Theo von Martius in 1909 and then with an American named Evan in 1940, to look for the rare ''[[Psychotria viridis|yakruna]]'', a sacred plant.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jordan |last=Hoffman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/17/embrace-of-the-serpent-review-ciro-guerra-colombian-amazon |title=Embrace of the Serpent review \u2013 dreamlike exploration of the Amazon's imperialist pollution |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 February 2016 |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nTheo, an ethnographer from [[T\u00fcbingen]] who has already been residing in the Amazon for several years, is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local named Manduca whom he had saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation. Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called \"the sun's semen\" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from [[virola]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Christina |last=Pratt |title=An Encyclopedia of Shamanism \u2013 Volume 2: N\u2013Z |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing|Rosen Publishing Group]] |page=423 |date=1 June 2007 |isbn=978-1-40421-141-4}}</ref>) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money. Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.\n\nMany years later an American botanist, Evan (Brionne Davis), paddles up to a much older Karamakate (Antonio Bol\u00edvar) who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide had sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his [[chullachaqui]], a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]]s, since the United States's supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.\n\nBoth expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a sadistic, lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any \"pagan\" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] figure who believes he is the Messiah. He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the [[Biblical Magi]], but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife. By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes.\n\nIn 1909, we are left with Theo, sick and having fled the Mission, arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the [[Amazon rubber boom]], where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men, and cultivated, against local traditions. Karamakate is furious and destroys it. In 1940, Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome-shaped mountains ([[Cerros de Mavecure]]), allegedly the home of yakruna. He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant \u2013 he has destroyed all the others \u2013 and prepares it for Evan. The preparation being hallucinogenic, aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience. While most of the film is in black-and-white, a part of this experience is shown in colour to signify its intensity. The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies.\n\n== Cast ==\nIn ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' magazine, the film's writer and director [[Ciro Guerra]] noted how the process of finding an actor who can successfully communicate the film's narrative was considered to be a difficult task. After his attempt in reaching out to a variety of indigenous people, it had come to his attention that the older generation were completely detached from the time depicted within the film. Through watching a film over 10 years ago in a workshop with the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]], Guerra was able to find the perfect actor, Nilbio Torres. Torres's two minute presence in the short film had a great impact on Guerra, encouraging him to pursue appointing him the role of Karamakate as \"There was nobody else that could play this guy. He's one of the last Ocaina people remaining. There's only about sixteen of them left.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Guill\u00e9n |url=https://www.cineaste.com/spring2016/embrace-of-the-serpent-ciro-guerra |title=Embrace of the Serpent: An Interview with Ciro Guerra |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |volume=41 |number=2 |date=Spring 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe chemistry between the two explorers was undoubtedly a perfect fit for the film. [[Richard Evans Schultes]] was an admired figure by many, he also had an eerie side to him that Guerra wanted to delve further into. Therefore, by pairing him with [[Brionne Davis]], it highlighted the parallels between the two characters. The two actors spent a lot of time with another during the production of the film  the relationship between the two strengthened greatly. Davis's virtuous presentation is made use of and then subverted as a means of playing with the audience's emotions and trust, a key feature prevalent throughout the film.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe cast are as follows:\n\n*Nilbio Torres as Young Karamakate\n*Antonio Bol\u00edvar as Old Karamakate\n*Jan Bijvoet as Theo\n*[[Brionne Davis]] as Evan\n*Luigi Sciamanna as Gaspar\n*Yauenk\u00fc Migue as Manduca\n*Nicol\u00e1s Cancino as Anizetto\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film explores the representation of the first people nations of the Amazon.

The black and white cinematography bears similarity to the [[daguerreotype]] photography of early twentieth century explorers who initially documented the Amazon and inspired the film.<ref name=\"Alphaville\" />\n\n== Production ==\nBefore production started, the director spent two and a half years researching the Colombian Amazon. They discovered a part of the jungle in the north west that had not yet been heavily affected by tourism or commerce and after gaining permission from the local community, they decided on the location.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Adam |last=Woodward |url=https://lwlies.com/articles/embrace-of-the-serpent-ciro-guerra-heart-of-darkness/ |title=Tropical malady \u2013 making a film in the heart of darkness |magazine=[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]] |date=8 June 2016 |accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref> The pre-production and shooting took place over the course of three months with the help of around 40 people from outside the Amazon and 60 people from indigenous communities within the Amazon. The director extensively collaborated with the community and invited them to participate and collaborate both in front and behind the camera. To avoid any problems caused by the harsh environment, the indigenous people taught the crew how to work with the jungle and performed rituals for spiritual protection.

Navajeevan Thomas Chettan\u00a0 has endeared himself to thousands and thousands of people belonging to various strata of society such as high officials, doctors, office bearers of Non -Governmental agencies, teachers, paramedical staff of government hospitals, officials of local self governing bodies,\u00a0 and students of higher secondary schools and colleges. To much poverty ridden ailing patients in the General wards of Medical College, and District hospital at Kottayam Thomas Chettan and Navajeevan are deputed by God himself to feed the hungry. To students of schools and colleges who attended his orientation programme Thomas \u00a0 Chettan is a living legend. P. U. Thomas is not a priest, not a missionary, not an academician, not a sociologist, not a psychiatrist but his unique personality integrates all these dimensions and he stands above all these professionals and wins the admiration of many by his own unique life totally committed to humanitarian values and selfless services to orphans, poor patients, destitute and mentally challenged persons. Thomas Chettan through Navajeevan offers food, shelter, security and treatment to these people. For three decades, P. U. Thomas is serving thousands of people with extraordinary vision and mission which is not confined to any particular religion or caste.\n\n'''Beginnings of Mission and Vision'''\n\nP. U. Thomas (Thomas Chettan) had humble beginnings in the native village of Athirampuzha in the district of Kottayam in Kerala, India. He was born in a Syrian Christian family as the son of PakkathukunnelUlahannan on 5 May 1949. As an ordinary village boy he had his primary education and upper primary education at St. Aloysius school at Athirampuzha. Hailing from a poverty ridden family, Thomas was not able to pursue his education beyond VII<sup>th</sup> standard. He along with a friend left his village and went to Ernakulam in search of a job. For two years P. U. Thomas tried at household job. Thomas remembers that it actually strengthened his mind to face challenges. When his father brought him back he was destined by God to do extraordinary services to fellow beings. Successful accomplishment of any mission is always rooted in a strong vision. At 16, God sent him the vision through an illness which affected his health badly. He suffered from the severe pains of ulcer. The Doctor in the district hospital at Kottayam town advised him to undergo surgery. Four decades ago surgery was rare which instilled great anxiety and fear in the minds of patients to which P. U. Thomas was not an exception. He deemed that to be the end of his life. The tiny town of Kottayam which had the district hospital was 10 kilometers away from his village. In those days bus services were rare. Majority travelled on foot or by bullock carts. Thomas with his father, walked all the way to the town. By around 3 o\u2019clock in the dawn they reached the municipal Office in the town, slept there as they had to reach the hospital at 8.30 am. The boy was admitted to the hospital but he had to spend 16 days in the hospital for his turn of surgery. The pathetic world of sufferings, poverty, and the ill-treatment of patients by the staff awakened the spring of sympathy and compassion in his sensitive heart. After the surgery too he spent nearly a fortnight in the hospital for further examinations. To his great relief and astonishment the boy found himself to be alive. The realities of patients in the general wards instilled an earnest desire in him to serve the poor patients in hospitals. He was in search of a job.\n\n'''Big Mission through small job'''\n\nAt the age of 20, he approached the authorities of men's hostel of Medical College Kottayam for a job in the hostel. Pratapan Nair, a third year degree course student was the secretary of the hostel council. He allowed Thomas to work in the hostel as a mess boy. Later Dr. Prathapn Nair served as the Professor and head of the Dept of ENT in Medical College and at present he is practicing in the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences at Kochi.  The boy was honest and hardworking. He was also assigned the job of tendering the garden in the hostel premises which he readily accepted.  The desire to help the poor patients in the general wards of Medical College was still alive in the mind of this young man. With permission he took over the left over food of the hostel for the poor patients. Thomas remembers that he usually carried two buckets of food to the general wards and distributed food among the people who deserved it. This silent service touched the heart of a few sensitive students who occasionally gave little amounts of money to feed the poor patients. He earned only Rs. 1''51-'' per month as salary. But he spent Rs. 5/- out of it to buy medicines for the poor patients. He requested a few students to donate money for one lunch which can satisfy the hunger of a few in the hospital. He got a good response. Later he got a part-time employment as apprentice in the garden at Medical College. The salary was meager. Yet he was generous in mind to spend money out of his pocket to buy medicines for the poor patients. He started the mission of feeding the poor in a better way. He approached the hotels near the medical college for food that remained excess. The canteen in Medical College co-operated with him. Thomas was now able to extend help to more patients in the general wards. At first many viewed this with contempt, but gradually his selfless service gained recognition from other attendees, nurses, and even doctors.  In 1970 he got an appointment in the medical college hospital as Grade IV attender on a salary of Rs.70/- per month. Now every day he brought with him tow packets of lunch from his own home, one for himself and one for any deserving patient. The newspapers recognized his services. Gradually individuals, doctors, Para-medical staff donated him money as they were quite convinced about his vision and mission. This continued for nearly two decades. He set the unique example of a how a very ordinary person, a class IV government servant can render extraordinary services to society around him.\n\nBesides his normal official duties, he found time to communicate with poor patients, consoled them through prayers. He collected money form philanthropists, good willed people from locality to give medicine, to arrange donation of blood to the needy.  He often became the by-stander of patients \u00a0 who were unconscious. The doctors in almost all the departments of medical college recognized and appreciated his services. Thomas even gave money to poor patients to return to their home, gave clothing to the needy. Such selfless services were rendered by an ordinary government servant .The services had no zeal for conversion; it was not for publicity. He did not receive money from religious institutions or any foreign agencies. Thomas believes that the generosity of the people of Kottayam to feed others enabled him to carry out the mission of feeding the poor.\n\n'''Navajeevan'''\u2013 '''Origin and Development'''\n\nIn 1980 when P. U. Thomas working in the psychiatry ward of Medical College he witnessed the most wretched form of life on earth. He also witnessed the springs of love and compassion in Dr. Kalyani who was practicing in the psychiatry ward since 1973. This doctor often spent money out of her own pocket for the rehabilitation of poor patients who were not taken back to their home by their own kith and kin.\u00a0 Thomas remembers that Dr. Kalyani was a good role model. She was an angel who inspired him to think about the mentally challenged people who become destitute. He also recollects how Dr. Kumar, Department of Psychiatry rendered him great support for rendering services to these patients during treatment. In 1982 through the news in a daily he came to know about an insane person \u00a0 a devotee of Lord Ayyppa who\u00a0 along with his brother came all the way from Coimbatore as a pilgrim to Sabarimala. Unfortunately he lost the way and reached the town of Kottayam. He lost his money, memory and became an insane wanderer. Thomas brought him to the Department of Psychiatry, bathed him, dressed him and admitted him in the psychiatry ward for treatment. He was the guardian and bystander for the patient. \u00a0 Through treatment his condition gradually improved. Meanwhile, Thomas contacted the Ayyappa SevaSangam at Kottayam. They published the photo and details of this patient in dailies in Tamil Nadu. This advertisement brought his brother to the hospital. Thomas remarks that the reunion which brought the memories of the patient to normalcy convinced him that treatment and language of love can work miracles for mentally disabled people who are normally set aside by the civilized society.\n\nIn 1988 Navajeevan Trust had its modest beginnings in a lodging room near medical college taken on lease for sheltering the mentally derailed street roamers picked from the town and the neighborhood. In this venture Thomas had the support of good hearted medical students, who vacated a room in the lodge for the service of Thomas. The first inmates were Abu, Jadayu and Aravind. Abu was a lunatic who wandered through the street of CMS college road and in the midst of the town of Kottayam. He was a funny character for the people as he always walked backwards. He was nicknamed \u2019reverse Abu\u2019. When Thomas came to know about him he requested the Deputy Superintendent of police to allow him to take the patient to the psychiatry department. The police Station West Circle, Kottayam offered their services to tackle reverse Abu for admitting him to the hospital as he turned violent and resisted. Thomas and his well wishers bathed him for one hour, dressed his hair, beard, dressed him in good cloth and administered medicine. Later he was cured and he was sheltered in the room taken on lease. Jadayu and Aravind were lunatics who were rescued from the pathetic life on the streets by Thomas. They were admitted in the psychiatry ward. After proper treatment they regained the control of their minds. Jadayu and Aravind are still inmates who render valuable services as the volunteers of Navajeevan.\n\nThe fourth inmate was Manubhai a Rajstani woman. Manubhai is a special case. Nobody knows how she reached Kottayam. Thomas found her near the heap of medical college wastes. Hunger forced her to search for food amidst wastes. She could hardly recollect her own name. She was not aware that she was six months pregnant. Thomas made arrangements for food, shelter and treatment in the hospital premises. He made arrangements for her delivery. The child was entrusted with a charitable society. Once again Mnubhai escaped to the town. But Thomas, aware of the exploitation of such women, traced her with help of police and admitted her to the mental hospital at Trivandrum. After a prolonged treatment she regained her mental health and is now an inmate of Navajeevan.\n\nLater Thomas was allowed to have all the sixteen rooms in that lodge for a rent of Rs.2000/ month for the rehabilitation of such disabled patients. This rented building was the centre of the activities of Navajeevan for many years. Forty-three inmates were offered food, shelter and treatment. A good number among them were women and old men. By this time more people were encouraging and participating in this humanitarian Endeavour.\n\nNavajeevan was registered as a trust of seven members with Thomas as the Managing Trustee. At present the seven members including P. U. Thomas are C. Emmanuel, Biju, T. Paul, Mathew, Dr. Thomas, K. Joseph. Kerala. Advocate Emmanuel one of the lawyers at Kottayam assisted Thomas in drafting the deed. He also joined Navajeevan as a volunteer. Navajeevan was formally inaugurated on 15 August 1992 by Sri. Ommen Chandy the then Finance Minister of Kerala.\n\nNavajeevan trust is located at Villooni a rural region in the Arpookara Panchayat. It is 4&nbsp;km away from Medical College Kottayam. Five acres of land was purchased by liberal donations of different categories of people. A new three-storied building was constructed with the help of voluntary organizations. The building has 22 rooms apart from room for prayer, library, and recreation, storing medical aids and dining. Financial assistance from religious/government/foreign agencies is neither sought nor received through projects.\u00a0 Thomas fears that such help would curtail the freedom of action and efficiency in the administration of the institution. Thomas is also very particular that the institution must have a secular nature. Thomas does not want to be known as a missionary as he does not have any zeal for conversion or publicity. His services are for one and all irrespective of community, caste or religion. He does not even bother about such details and no inquiries are made. To him anyone who receives his services is just fellow beings who were brought before him through Divine intervention.  The motto of the trust is noted below\n''\u201cTruly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are''\n\n''members of my family, you did it to me.\u201d'' (Matthew 25:40)\n|-\n|17 February 2017\n|James Sewell\n|Mr James Sewell has, for almost 50 years, provided dedicated financial and accounting services to the Our Lady of Dolours Servite Church in Fulham, England.

U. Thomas- An Ordinary Man with Extraordinary Mission'''\n\nP. U. Thomas is the founder and Managing Director of Navajeevan Trust which celebrated its 23<sup>rd</sup> anniversary on the 1 May 2014. \u00a0 P. U. Thomas is popularly known as Thomas Chettan (Chettan \u2013 elder brother). Actually Navajeevan Thomas Chettan has become his name in Kerala as well as among Keralites in foreign countries who are familiar with Navajeevan trust through newspapers in Malayalam.  Navajeevan Thomas Chettan\u00a0 has endeared himself to thousands and thousands of people belonging to various strata of society such as high officials, doctors, office bearers of Non -Governmental agencies, teachers, paramedical staff of government hospitals, officials of local self governing bodies,\u00a0 and students of higher secondary schools and colleges. To much poverty ridden ailing patients in the General wards of Medical College, and District hospital at Kottayam Thomas Chettan and Navajeevan are deputed by God himself to feed the hungry. To students of schools and colleges who attended his orientation programme Thomas \u00a0 Chettan is a living legend. P. U. Thomas is not a priest, not a missionary, not an academician, not a sociologist, not a psychiatrist but his unique personality integrates all these dimensions and he stands above all these professionals and wins the admiration of many by his own unique life totally committed to humanitarian values and selfless services to orphans, poor patients, destitute and mentally challenged persons. Thomas Chettan through Navajeevan offers food, shelter, security and treatment to these people. For three decades, P. U. Thomas is serving thousands of people with extraordinary vision and mission which is not confined to any particular religion or caste.\n\n'''Beginnings of Mission and Vision'''\n\nP. U. Thomas (Thomas Chettan) had humble beginnings in the native village of Athirampuzha in the district of Kottayam in Kerala, India. He was born in a Syrian Christian family as the son of PakkathukunnelUlahannan on 5 May 1949. As an ordinary village boy he had his primary education and upper primary education at St. Aloysius school at Athirampuzha. Hailing from a poverty ridden family, Thomas was not able to pursue his education beyond VII<sup>th</sup> standard. He along with a friend left his village and went to Ernakulam in search of a job. For two years P. U. Thomas tried at household job. Thomas remembers that it actually strengthened his mind to face challenges. When his father brought him back he was destined by God to do extraordinary services to fellow beings. Successful accomplishment of any mission is always rooted in a strong vision. At 16, God sent him the vision through an illness which affected his health badly. He suffered from the severe pains of ulcer. The Doctor in the district hospital at Kottayam town advised him to undergo surgery. Four decades ago surgery was rare which instilled great anxiety and fear in the minds of patients to which P. U. Thomas was not an exception. He deemed that to be the end of his life. The tiny town of Kottayam which had the district hospital was 10 kilometers away from his village. In those days bus services were rare. Majority travelled on foot or by bullock carts. Thomas with his father, walked all the way to the town. By around 3 o\u2019clock in the dawn they reached the municipal Office in the town, slept there as they had to reach the hospital at 8.30 am. The boy was admitted to the hospital but he had to spend 16 days in the hospital for his turn of surgery. The pathetic world of sufferings, poverty, and the ill-treatment of patients by the staff awakened the spring of sympathy and compassion in his sensitive heart. After the surgery too he spent nearly a fortnight in the hospital for further examinations. To his great relief and astonishment the boy found himself to be alive. The realities of patients in the general wards instilled an earnest desire in him to serve the poor patients in hospitals. He was in search of a job.\n\n'''Big Mission through small job'''\n\nAt the age of 20, he approached the authorities of men's hostel of Medical College Kottayam for a job in the hostel. Pratapan Nair, a third year degree course student was the secretary of the hostel council. He allowed Thomas to work in the hostel as a mess boy. Later Dr. Prathapn Nair served as the Professor and head of the Dept of ENT in Medical College and at present he is practicing in the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences at Kochi.  The boy was honest and hardworking. He was also assigned the job of tendering the garden in the hostel premises which he readily accepted.  The desire to help the poor patients in the general wards of Medical College was still alive in the mind of this young man. With permission he took over the left over food of the hostel for the poor patients. Thomas remembers that he usually carried two buckets of food to the general wards and distributed food among the people who deserved it. This silent service touched the heart of a few sensitive students who occasionally gave little amounts of money to feed the poor patients. He earned only Rs. 1''51-'' per month as salary. But he spent Rs. 5/- out of it to buy medicines for the poor patients. He requested a few students to donate money for one lunch which can satisfy the hunger of a few in the hospital. He got a good response. Later he got a part-time employment as apprentice in the garden at Medical College. The salary was meager. Yet he was generous in mind to spend money out of his pocket to buy medicines for the poor patients. He started the mission of feeding the poor in a better way. He approached the hotels near the medical college for food that remained excess. The canteen in Medical College co-operated with him. Thomas was now able to extend help to more patients in the general wards. At first many viewed this with contempt, but gradually his selfless service gained recognition from other attendees, nurses, and even doctors.  In 1970 he got an appointment in the medical college hospital as Grade IV attender on a salary of Rs.70/- per month. Now every day he brought with him tow packets of lunch from his own home, one for himself and one for any deserving patient. The newspapers recognized his services. Gradually individuals, doctors, Para-medical staff donated him money as they were quite convinced about his vision and mission. This continued for nearly two decades. He set the unique example of a how a very ordinary person, a class IV government servant can render extraordinary services to society around him.\n\nBesides his normal official duties, he found time to communicate with poor patients, consoled them through prayers. He collected money form philanthropists, good willed people from locality to give medicine, to arrange donation of blood to the needy.  He often became the by-stander of patients \u00a0 who were unconscious. The doctors in almost all the departments of medical college recognized and appreciated his services. Thomas even gave money to poor patients to return to their home, gave clothing to the needy. Such selfless services were rendered by an ordinary government servant .The services had no zeal for conversion; it was not for publicity. He did not receive money from religious institutions or any foreign agencies. Thomas believes that the generosity of the people of Kottayam to feed others enabled him to carry out the mission of feeding the poor.\n\n'''Navajeevan'''\u2013 '''Origin and Development'''\n\nIn 1980 when P. U. Thomas working in the psychiatry ward of Medical College he witnessed the most wretched form of life on earth. He also witnessed the springs of love and compassion in Dr. Kalyani who was practicing in the psychiatry ward since 1973. This doctor often spent money out of her own pocket for the rehabilitation of poor patients who were not taken back to their home by their own kith and kin.\u00a0 Thomas remembers that Dr. Kalyani was a good role model. She was an angel who inspired him to think about the mentally challenged people who become destitute. He also recollects how Dr. Kumar, Department of Psychiatry rendered him great support for rendering services to these patients during treatment. In 1982 through the news in a daily he came to know about an insane person \u00a0 a devotee of Lord Ayyppa who\u00a0 along with his brother came all the way from Coimbatore as a pilgrim to Sabarimala. Unfortunately he lost the way and reached the town of Kottayam. He lost his money, memory and became an insane wanderer. Thomas brought him to the Department of Psychiatry, bathed him, dressed him and admitted him in the psychiatry ward for treatment. He was the guardian and bystander for the patient. \u00a0 Through treatment his condition gradually improved. Meanwhile, Thomas contacted the Ayyappa SevaSangam at Kottayam. They published the photo and details of this patient in dailies in Tamil Nadu. This advertisement brought his brother to the hospital. Thomas remarks that the reunion which brought the memories of the patient to normalcy convinced him that treatment and language of love can work miracles for mentally disabled people who are normally set aside by the civilized society.\n\nIn 1988 Navajeevan Trust had its modest beginnings in a lodging room near medical college taken on lease for sheltering the mentally derailed street roamers picked from the town and the neighborhood. In this venture Thomas had the support of good hearted medical students, who vacated a room in the lodge for the service of Thomas. The first inmates were Abu, Jadayu and Aravind. Abu was a lunatic who wandered through the street of CMS college road and in the midst of the town of Kottayam. He was a funny character for the people as he always walked backwards. He was nicknamed \u2019reverse Abu\u2019. When Thomas came to know about him he requested the Deputy Superintendent of police to allow him to take the patient to the psychiatry department. The police Station West Circle, Kottayam offered their services to tackle reverse Abu for admitting him to the hospital as he turned violent and resisted. Thomas and his well wishers bathed him for one hour, dressed his hair, beard, dressed him in good cloth and administered medicine. Later he was cured and he was sheltered in the room taken on lease. Jadayu and Aravind were lunatics who were rescued from the pathetic life on the streets by Thomas. They were admitted in the psychiatry ward. After proper treatment they regained the control of their minds. Jadayu and Aravind are still inmates who render valuable services as the volunteers of Navajeevan.\n\nThe fourth inmate was Manubhai a Rajstani woman. Manubhai is a special case. Nobody knows how she reached Kottayam. Thomas found her near the heap of medical college wastes. Hunger forced her to search for food amidst wastes. She could hardly recollect her own name. She was not aware that she was six months pregnant. Thomas made arrangements for food, shelter and treatment in the hospital premises. He made arrangements for her delivery. The child was entrusted with a charitable society. Once again Mnubhai escaped to the town. But Thomas, aware of the exploitation of such women, traced her with help of police and admitted her to the mental hospital at Trivandrum. After a prolonged treatment she regained her mental health and is now an inmate of Navajeevan.\n\nLater Thomas was allowed to have all the sixteen rooms in that lodge for a rent of Rs.2000/ month for the rehabilitation of such disabled patients. This rented building was the centre of the activities of Navajeevan for many years. Forty-three inmates were offered food, shelter and treatment. A good number among them were women and old men. By this time more people were encouraging and participating in this humanitarian Endeavour.\n\nNavajeevan was registered as a trust of seven members with Thomas as the Managing Trustee. At present the seven members including P. U. Thomas are C. Emmanuel, Biju, T. Paul, Mathew, Dr. Thomas, K. Joseph. Kerala. Advocate Emmanuel one of the lawyers at Kottayam assisted Thomas in drafting the deed. He also joined Navajeevan as a volunteer. Navajeevan was formally inaugurated on 15 August 1992 by Sri. Ommen Chandy the then Finance Minister of Kerala.\n\nNavajeevan trust is located at Villooni a rural region in the Arpookara Panchayat. It is 4&nbsp;km away from Medical College Kottayam. Five acres of land was purchased by liberal donations of different categories of people. A new three-storied building was constructed with the help of voluntary organizations. The building has 22 rooms apart from room for prayer, library, and recreation, storing medical aids and dining. Financial assistance from religious/government/foreign agencies is neither sought nor received through projects.\u00a0 Thomas fears that such help would curtail the freedom of action and efficiency in the administration of the institution. Thomas is also very particular that the institution must have a secular nature. Thomas does not want to be known as a missionary as he does not have any zeal for conversion or publicity. His services are for one and all irrespective of community, caste or religion. He does not even bother about such details and no inquiries are made. To him anyone who receives his services is just fellow beings who were brought before him through Divine intervention.  The motto of the trust is noted below\n''\u201cTruly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are''\n\n''members of my family, you did it to me.\u201d'' (Matthew 25:40)\n|-\n|17 February 2017\n|James Sewell\n|Mr James Sewell has, for almost 50 years, provided dedicated financial and accounting services to the Our Lady of Dolours Servite Church in Fulham, England.

Tara goes to a nearby park and seems upset. There is a passage of time.\n\nTara and Mark are asleep in bed, when they are woken by a phone call. Tara resignedly has sex with Mark, during which she is in tears, unknowingly to Mark. She helps Mark get ready for work, and takes the children to school. When she leaves the school she stops and stands outside, in distress. The following Saturday morning Tara wakes up early, trying not to wake up Mark. He does wake up and she reluctantly engages in sex with him, again in distress unnoticed by Mark. Following a visit to the park, Mark tries to have sex with her in one of the children's rooms, which she refuses. Mark questions whether she's having an affair which she denies and they argue. Later they're having a BBQ with friends and Mark berates her for not providing drinks for the guests. That evening they are having sex again, and Tara again is crying and in distress. Afterwards she repeatedly whispers that she is not happy, and after some brief discussion with Mark she says she's going to sleep. There is a passage of time.\n\nTara goes to London by herself, where she discovers and buys a book about the tapestries of ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' at a second-hand bookseller. Later that evening she discusses with Mark attending an art course and is upset that he does not understand how important it is to her, although he ultimately agrees that she should do whatever makes her happy. Later they go out for dinner, but they are both disconnected. A following morning, Tara takes the children to school and on the drive home stops at the [[Eurostar]] [[Ebbsfleet International railway station]]. She sits and watches the trains and forgets to pick the children up from school, arriving late. Teddy is particularly upset, and once home Tara becomes enraged and swears at him for moving her book. Enraged, she leaves the house briefly then returns to apologise profusely to the children. Later that evening she discusses with Mark how she doesn't care about being a parent. The following day she discusses her issues with her mother, Alison, who is not supportive and tells her it's a phase. A following morning, Tara refuses to help with the children during breakfast. Mark takes the children to school and returns home to try and resolve things with her. Mark berates her, but ultimately apologises and tells her he just wants her to be happy. There is a passage of time.\n\nTara is increasingly detached and anxious. She knocks over a jug of orange juice while tidying up breakfast for which Mark berates her. She goes to the bedroom and packs a bag with clothes and her passport. Mark tries to stop her but she leaves in the car. Mark is upset and tries to calm the children. Tara goes to Ebbsfleet and takes a train to Paris.\n\nTara walks around Paris, happy. She stays overnight at a hotel. The following morning she travels by [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] to the [[Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge]] to see the tapestries of ''The Lady and the Unicorn''. On the way in to the museum she passes a man with a camera. Later in the museum the man, Phillipe, takes photos of Tara and discusses the history of the tapestries with her. They both tell each they are not in a relationship. They spend the rest of the day together and end up having sex in Tara's hotel room. They are interrupted by a message on Phillipe's phone. Tara questions who the message is from, and Phillipe admits to being married and having a child. She tells him to leave, which he does. Tara listens to the pleading voicemails from Mark, her children, and her mother, while crying. She leaves the hotel and is extremely upset and anxious. Tara wakes up on the sofa the following morning. A French woman, Anna, took pity on her and she spent the night at her house. Anna counsels Tara about her life and tells her to try and change her life with her husband, but if that does not work, then do it without him. Mark has travelled to Paris, and Tara goes to meet him. They embrace. There is a passage of time.\n\nThe first scene of the story plays again, and it transpires was from the future. Tara is living in a different home. Tara goes to the park, and this time we hear she stops to see a mother and child playing together. She is upset, briefly, then continues to walk on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as Tara\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as Mark\n* [[Frances Barber]] as Alison\n* [[Marthe Keller]] as Anna\n* [[Jalil Lespert]] as Phillipe\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in Kent, London and Paris.

English (later British) East Indiamen usually ran between England, the Cape of Good Hope and India, where their primary destinations were the ports of [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The Indiamen often continued on to China before returning to England via the Cape of Good Hope and [[Saint Helena]]. When the company lost its monopoly, the ships of this design were sold off. A smaller, faster ship known as a [[Blackwall Frigate]] was built for the trade as the need to carry heavy armaments declined.\n\n==Description of the sailing vessels and the trade==\n[[Image:VOC ship Amsterdam2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A full-scale replica of the Dutch Indiaman [[Amsterdam (VOC ship)|''Amsterdam]]'']]\n\"East Indiaman\" was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the [[East India Company (disambiguation)|East India Companies]] of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. These include the Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese and Swedish East India companies.\n\nEast Indiamen carried both passengers and goods, and were armed to defend themselves against pirates. Initially, the East Indiamen were built to carry as much cargo as possible, rather than for speed of sailing.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tea Clippers |url=http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers |publisher=U.K. Tea and Infusions Association |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> The [[British East India Company|East India company]] had a monopoly on trade with [[British Indian Empire|India]] and [[China]], supporting this design.\n\nEast Indiamen were the largest merchant ships regularly built during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, generally measuring between 1100 and 1400 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen (bm)]]. Two of the largest were the ''[[Earl of Mansfield (ship)|Earl of Mansfield]]'' and ''[[HMS Madras (1795)|Lascelles]]'' being built at [[Deptford]] in 1795. The [[Royal Navy]] purchased both, converted them to 56-gun [[fourth rate]]s, and renamed them ''[[HMS Weymouth (1795)|Weymouth]]'' and ''[[HMS Madras (1795)|Madras]]'' respectively.  They measured 1426 tons (bm) on dimensions of approximately 175 feet overall length of hull, 144 feet keel, 43 feet beam, 17 feet draft.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn England, Queen Elizabeth I granted an exclusive right to the trade to [[East India Company#Establishments in Britain|one company]] in 1600. This monopoly lasted until 1834. The company grew to encompass more than the trade between England and India, but the ships described in this article are the type used in the 17th to the early 19th centuries to carry the trade.\n\n==During the wars with France==\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] they were often painted to resemble warships; an attacker could not be sure if gunports were real or merely paint, and some Indiamen carried sizable armaments. The [[Royal Navy]] acquired several East Indiamen, turning them into [[fourth rate]]s (e.g., HMS ''Weymouth'' and HMS ''Madras'', described above), maintaining the confusion for military ships seeking merchant ships as prizes of war. In some cases the East Indiamen successfully fought off attacks by the French. One of the most celebrated of these incidents occurred in 1804, when a fleet of East Indiamen and other merchant vessels under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Nathaniel Dance]] successfully fought off a marauding squadron commanded by Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre L\u00e9on Durand Linois|Linois]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] in the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]].\n\nDue to the need to carry heavy cannon, the hull of the East Indiamen \u2013 in common with most warships of the time \u2013 was much wider at the waterline than at the upper deck, so that guns carried on the upper deck were closer to the centre-line to aid stability. This is known as [[tumblehome]]. The ships normally had two complete decks for accommodation within the hull and a raised [[poop deck]]. The poop deck and the deck below it were lit with square-windowed galleries at the stern. To support the weight of the galleries, the hull lines towards the stern were full. Later ships built without this feature tended to sail faster,{{when|date=August 2015}} which put the East Indiamen at a commercial disadvantage once the need for heavy armament passed.\n\n==Ships for the India-China trade==\n\n[[Image:East Indiamen in a Gale.jpg|200px|left|East Indiamen in a Gale, by [[Charles Brooking]], c. 1759|thumb]]\n[[File:Wreck of the Grosvenor02.jpg|thumb|East Indiaman ''Grosvenor'' by [[George Carter (artist)|George Carter]]]]\nAccording to historian [[Fernand Braudel]], some of the finest and largest Indiamen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were built in India, making use of Indian shipbuilding techniques and crewed by Indians, their hulls of Indian [[teak]] being especially suitable for local waters. These ships were used for the China run. Until the coming of steamships, these Indian-built ships were relied upon almost exclusively by the British in the eastern seas. None sailed to Europe and they were banned from English ports.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Many hundreds of Indian-built Indiamen were built for the British, along with other ships, including warships. Notable among them were ''Surat Castle'' (1791), a 1,000-ton (bm) ship with a crew of 150, ''Lowjee Family'', of 800 tons (bm) and a crew of 125, and ''Shampinder'' (1802), of 1,300 tons (bm).<ref>{{cite book |last=Braudel |first=Fernand |title=The Perspective of the World: Civilization & Capitalism, 15th\u201318th Century |volume=3 |year=1979 |publisher= Harper & Row |isbn=0-06-015317-2 |page=506}}</ref>\n\n==Notable ships==\n[[File:Ostindiefararen-G\u00f6theborg-avsegling-oktober-2005.jpg|thumb|The full-scale sailing replica of the Swedish East Indiaman ''[[G\u00f6theborg (ship)|G\u00f6theborg]]'' in 2005]]\nAnother significant East Indiaman in this period was the 1176-ton (bm) ''Warley'' that John Perry built at his [[Blackwall Yard]] in 1788, and which the [[Royal Navy]] bought in 1795 and renamed {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}. In 1803 she was employed as a transport to establish a settlement at [[Port Phillip]] in Australia, later shifted to the site of current-day [[Hobart, Tasmania]] by an accompanying ship, the ''Ocean''. French forces captured ''Calcutta'' in 1805 off the [[Isles of Scilly]]. She grounded at the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]] in 1809, and was burned by a British boarding party after her French crew had abandoned her.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe 1200-ton (bm) [[Arniston (ship)|''Arniston'']] was likewise employed by the Royal Navy as a troop transport between England and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. In 1815, she was wrecked near [[Cape Agulhas]] with the loss of 372 lives after a navigation error that was caused by inaccurate [[dead reckoning]] and the lack of a [[marine chronometer]] with which to calculate her [[longitude]].\n\n==End of the era of East Indiamen sailing ships==\n[[Image:East Indiamen Madagascar.JPG|thumb|260px|right|East Indiaman \"Madagascar\", circa 1837]]\nWith the progressive restriction of the monopoly of the [[British East India Company]] the desire to build such large armed ships for commercial use waned, and during the late 1830s a smaller, faster ship known as a [[Blackwall Frigate]] was built for the premium end of the India and China trades. The last of the East Indiamen was reputed to be the [[Java (1813 ship)|''Java'' (1813\u20131939)]] that became a coal hulk, then was broken up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gibraltar-intro.blogspot.com/2015/01/1811-java-triumph-of-skill-w.html|title=The People of Gibraltar |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nThe [[Battle of Pulo Aura]] is featured in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel [[HMS Surprise (novel)|''HMS Surprise'']], with French Admiral Linois in pursuit of a large fleet of East Indiamen. In the novel, HMS ''Surprise'' under Captain Aubrey organizes the merchantmen to defeat Linois and his squadron. In history, all the ships that defeated the French squadron were merchantmen.\n\nIn the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]], East Indiamen are involved in many of the novels, including the second set in the Peace of Amiens, where some of the sailors took positions on East Indiamen. In other of the novels, Aubrey intercepts enemy vessels that interfere with the merchant ships, earning their gratitude.\n\n==Examples of Indiamen==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" | Length (m)\n! scope=\"col\" | Tons burthen\n! scope=\"col\" | Service\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Comments\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''Admiral Gardner''\n| [[British East India Company|British]]\n| 44\n| 816\n| 1797\u20131809\n| stranded\n| Blown ashore on [[Goodwin Sands]] with the death of one crew member.

English (later British) East Indiamen usually ran between England, the Cape of Good Hope and India, where their primary destinations were the ports of [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The Indiamen often continued on to China before returning to England via the Cape of Good Hope and [[Saint Helena]]. When the company lost its monopoly, the ships of this design were sold off. A smaller, faster ship known as a [[Blackwall Frigate]] was built for the trade as the need to carry heavy armaments declined.\n\n==Description of the sailing vessels and the trade==\n[[Image:VOC ship Amsterdam2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A full-scale replica of the Dutch Indiaman [[Amsterdam (VOC ship)|''Amsterdam]]'']]\n\"East Indiaman\" was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the [[East India Company (disambiguation)|East India Companies]] of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. These include the Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese and Swedish East India companies.\n\nEast Indiamen carried both passengers and goods, and were armed to defend themselves against pirates. Initially, the East Indiamen were built to carry as much cargo as possible, rather than for speed of sailing.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Tea Clippers |url=http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers |publisher=U.K. Tea and Infusions Association |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> The [[British East India Company|East India company]] had a monopoly on trade with [[British Indian Empire|India]] and [[China]], supporting this design.\n\nEast Indiamen were the largest merchant ships regularly built during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, generally measuring between 1100 and 1400 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen (bm)]]. Two of the largest were the ''[[Earl of Mansfield (ship)|Earl of Mansfield]]'' and ''[[HMS Madras (1795)|Lascelles]]'' being built at [[Deptford]] in 1795. The [[Royal Navy]] purchased both, converted them to 56-gun [[fourth rate]]s, and renamed them ''[[HMS Weymouth (1795)|Weymouth]]'' and ''[[HMS Madras (1795)|Madras]]'' respectively.  They measured 1426 tons (bm) on dimensions of approximately 175 feet overall length of hull, 144 feet keel, 43 feet beam, 17 feet draft.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn England, Queen Elizabeth I granted an exclusive right to the trade to [[East India Company#Establishments in Britain|one company]] in 1600. This monopoly lasted until 1834. The company grew to encompass more than the trade between England and India, but the ships described in this article are the type used in the 17th to the early 19th centuries to carry the trade.\n\n==During the wars with France==\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] they were often painted to resemble warships; an attacker could not be sure if gunports were real or merely paint, and some Indiamen carried sizable armaments. The [[Royal Navy]] acquired several East Indiamen, turning them into [[fourth rate]]s (e.g., HMS ''Weymouth'' and HMS ''Madras'', described above), maintaining the confusion for military ships seeking merchant ships as prizes of war. In some cases the East Indiamen successfully fought off attacks by the French. One of the most celebrated of these incidents occurred in 1804, when a fleet of East Indiamen and other merchant vessels under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Nathaniel Dance]] successfully fought off a marauding squadron commanded by Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre L\u00e9on Durand Linois|Linois]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] in the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]].\n\nDue to the need to carry heavy cannon, the hull of the East Indiamen \u2013 in common with most warships of the time \u2013 was much wider at the waterline than at the upper deck, so that guns carried on the upper deck were closer to the centre-line to aid stability. This is known as [[tumblehome]]. The ships normally had two complete decks for accommodation within the hull and a raised [[poop deck]]. The poop deck and the deck below it were lit with square-windowed galleries at the stern. To support the weight of the galleries, the hull lines towards the stern were full. Later ships built without this feature tended to sail faster,{{when|date=August 2015}} which put the East Indiamen at a commercial disadvantage once the need for heavy armament passed.\n\n==Ships for the India-China trade==\n\n[[Image:East Indiamen in a Gale.jpg|200px|left|East Indiamen in a Gale, by [[Charles Brooking]], c. 1759|thumb]]\n[[File:Wreck of the Grosvenor02.jpg|thumb|East Indiaman ''Grosvenor'' by [[George Carter (artist)|George Carter]]]]\nAccording to historian [[Fernand Braudel]], some of the finest and largest Indiamen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were built in India, making use of Indian shipbuilding techniques and crewed by Indians, their hulls of Indian [[teak]] being especially suitable for local waters. These ships were used for the China run. Until the coming of steamships, these Indian-built ships were relied upon almost exclusively by the British in the eastern seas. None sailed to Europe and they were banned from English ports.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Many hundreds of Indian-built Indiamen were built for the British, along with other ships, including warships. Notable among them were ''Surat Castle'' (1791), a 1,000-ton (bm) ship with a crew of 150, ''Lowjee Family'', of 800 tons (bm) and a crew of 125, and ''Shampinder'' (1802), of 1,300 tons (bm).<ref>{{cite book |last=Braudel |first=Fernand |title=The Perspective of the World: Civilization & Capitalism, 15th\u201318th Century |volume=3 |year=1979 |publisher= Harper & Row |isbn=0-06-015317-2 |page=506}}</ref>\n\n==Notable ships==\n[[File:Ostindiefararen-G\u00f6theborg-avsegling-oktober-2005.jpg|thumb|The full-scale sailing replica of the Swedish East Indiaman ''[[G\u00f6theborg (ship)|G\u00f6theborg]]'' in 2005]]\nAnother significant East Indiaman in this period was the 1176-ton (bm) ''Warley'' that John Perry built at his [[Blackwall Yard]] in 1788, and which the [[Royal Navy]] bought in 1795 and renamed {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}. In 1803 she was employed as a transport to establish a settlement at [[Port Phillip]] in Australia, later shifted to the site of current-day [[Hobart, Tasmania]] by an accompanying ship, the ''Ocean''. French forces captured ''Calcutta'' in 1805 off the [[Isles of Scilly]]. She grounded at the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]] in 1809, and was burned by a British boarding party after her French crew had abandoned her.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe 1200-ton (bm) [[Arniston (ship)|''Arniston'']] was likewise employed by the Royal Navy as a troop transport between England and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. In 1815, she was wrecked near [[Cape Agulhas]] with the loss of 372 lives after a navigation error that was caused by inaccurate [[dead reckoning]] and the lack of a [[marine chronometer]] with which to calculate her [[longitude]].\n\n==End of the era of East Indiamen sailing ships==\n[[Image:East Indiamen Madagascar.JPG|thumb|260px|right|East Indiaman \"Madagascar\", circa 1837]]\nWith the progressive restriction of the monopoly of the [[British East India Company]] the desire to build such large armed ships for commercial use waned, and during the late 1830s a smaller, faster ship known as a [[Blackwall Frigate]] was built for the premium end of the India and China trades. The last of the East Indiamen was reputed to be the [[Java (1813 ship)|''Java'' (1813\u20131939)]] that became a coal hulk, then was broken up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gibraltar-intro.blogspot.com/2015/01/1811-java-triumph-of-skill-w.html|title=The People of Gibraltar |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nThe [[Battle of Pulo Aura]] is featured in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel [[HMS Surprise (novel)|''HMS Surprise'']], with French Admiral Linois in pursuit of a large fleet of East Indiamen. In the novel, HMS ''Surprise'' under Captain Aubrey organizes the merchantmen to defeat Linois and his squadron. In history, all the ships that defeated the French squadron were merchantmen.\n\nIn the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]], East Indiamen are involved in many of the novels, including the second set in the Peace of Amiens, where some of the sailors took positions on East Indiamen. In other of the novels, Aubrey intercepts enemy vessels that interfere with the merchant ships, earning their gratitude.\n\n==Examples of Indiamen==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" | Length (m)\n! scope=\"col\" | Tons burthen\n! scope=\"col\" | Service\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Comments\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''Admiral Gardner''\n| [[British East India Company|British]]\n| 44\n| 816\n| 1797\u20131809\n| stranded\n| Blown ashore on [[Goodwin Sands]] with the death of one crew member.

Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is the Prisoner, a greenish blob of an unknown substance capable of possessing executed bodies in the depths of the island. While the \"Head\" of the Prisoner is immortal, the bodies it possesses are not, and dying will force it to slink back to the Prison Quarters.\n===Synopsis===\nThe Prisoner awakens in the depths of the Island's prison, next to a giant skeleton with a spear inside of it, a character named \"The Giant\", in the castle the player can discover that The Giant was murdered on the King's orders.\n\nA soldier implies that they have been trying to escape for an unspecified period of time. As the Prisoner works their way out of the Prison Quarters, they navigate the Island, and it is revealed to the player that the Island was once a mighty kingdom, until a plague known as \"The Malaise\" swept through, reducing most of its citizens to mindless zombies or monstrous husks. The Kingdom's Alchemist worked tirelessly to find a cure, but mysteriously disappeared as the king himself became reclusive. As the kingdom fell, the remaining citizens began to rebel against the King, only to either die by infection, seclusion, or by their own hands.\n\nOnce the prisoner dies, the giant skeleton disappears, and the soldier that told you about your previous escape attempts is found dead, and her body decays with each subsequent run.\n\nThe Prisoner encounters and fights several entities as they travel across the island: The Concierge, who was once the prison's guard Castaing, before his infection and subsequent transformation into a hulking monster; Conjonctivius, a nameless, faceless bloated corpse that was transformed into a grotesque tentacled Beholder-like monster; and The Time Keeper, a woman with some mastery over time, who continuously resets time each day to prevent her own infection. They also encounter The Collector, a hooded figure who trades items to the Prisoner in exchange for Cells, which drop from defeated enemies and are implied to be a sort of essence of life; and The Blacksmith and his apprentices, who upgrade the Prisoner's weapons and arsenal.\n\nEventually, the Prisoner reaches the castle's throne room, and faces off against the Hand of the King, while the King sits seemingly comatose upon his throne. The Prisoner defeats the Hand of the King, takes his weapon, and uses it to kill the King. The King's body violently explodes, destroying the Prisoner's host body and resetting the game, though giving the Prisoner the ability to act outside of a host body while still possessing the body. As the Prisoner's head returns to the quarters to find a new corpse to possess, it remarks on how even though the king has died, nothing has changed.\n\nThe Rise of the Giant DLC adds additional content, including new endings. The Prisoner gains access to a new area of the Island, The Cavern, which now houses the titanic undead skeletal Giant, who acts as a new boss for the area. The Giant, upon defeating it, reveals that the Prisoner is actually the King himself, his soul split from his body by consequence of his and the Alchemist's experiments. As the Prisoner continues, The Time Keeper begins actively altering the timeline to prevent her own death. After defeating the Hand of the King again (who is once more alive, though the King's body is still destroyed), if the player has all five Boss Cells (Modifiers which make the game substantially more difficult, earned by beating the game on each difficulty) active, they are able to gain access to the Astrolab and the Observatory. There, the Prisoner can find the Collector, who is implied to be the King's Alchemist. The Collector reveals that he has been collecting Cells to create a Panacea, to cure the Malaise once and for all. The Collector however, upon drinking the Panacea, goes mad with power and attempts to kill the Prisoner to reset the game so they'll bring him more Cells. While fighting the Collector, the Prisoner drinks some of the Panacea, which, upon the Collector's death, causes the Prisoner's host body to evaporate, resetting the game once more.\n\nThis time however, the Time Keeper fully resets the timeline. This allows the Prisoner, upon reaching the throne room and defeating the Hand of the King, to possess the King, getting his original body back. However, the body is infected with the Malaise, and so to prevent his own decay, he continues to the Observatory to face the Collector again. This time, upon the Collector's defeat, the Panacea cures the King and binds his body and soul once more.\n\nThe King returns to his throne, where he remarks over a glass of wine that he was honestly having more fun crawling around the sewers, when, due to the Time Keeper's meddling, a time-displaced Prisoner arrives in the throne room. The King and the Prisoner face off, and begin to duel.\n\n==Development==\n{{external media|right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqD1g6ROP_0 The Making of Dead Cells, by Red Bull Gaming]}}\n''Dead Cells''{{'}}s developer [[Motion Twin]] had been developing games for the [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile gaming]] market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \"passion project\", a game that was \"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players.<ref name=\"vb\">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | title = Studio abandons free-to-play web and mobile games for passion project: Dead Cells | first = Stephanie | last = Chan | date = April 19, 2017 | accessdate = May 12, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211620/https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | archive-date = October 19, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Motion Twin had set out to make a follow-up to their browser game ''[[Die2Nite]]'', which was a cooperative [[tower defense]] game for up to forty players released in 2008; for most of the game, players would work together to form defenses around a town, and then during a night phase, wait to see if their town survived waves of attacks by zombies. Initially they wanted to have the sequel improved by allowing players to take actions and fight during the night phase, implementing [[free to play]] mechanics. While this version worked well with large number of players, Motion Twin found it was not very exciting for single players.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | title = Dead Cells is a perfect example of Early Access done right | first = Jody | last = Macgregor | date = August 11, 2018 | accessdate = August 13, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180812083820/https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | archive-date = August 12, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In 2014, they stripped down the game to basically a single-player experience between preparation and combat, and took it to an event called the Big Indie Pitch, where the idea came in second place. Inspired by this, they decided to strip away the game's preparation phase and focus it as a combat-based game. The process of figuring out how to keep and work from these combat elements took about a year up through the end of 2015.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\"/>\n\nTo tighten the gameplay, Motion Twin took inspiration of the Engineer class from ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took ''Dead Cells'' into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach).<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game.<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get.

The player gains various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated levels to fight undead creatures within it. At times, the player may gain \"cells\", a type of in-game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades or unlock new items for the player if they reach the vendor between each level. Dead Cells uses a permadeath system, causing the player to lose all cells and other currencies or items upon each instance of death.

Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is the Prisoner, a greenish blob of an unknown substance capable of possessing executed bodies in the depths of the island. While the \"Head\" of the Prisoner is immortal, the bodies it possesses are not, and dying will force it to slink back to the Prison Quarters.\n===Synopsis===\nThe Prisoner awakens in the depths of the Island's prison, next to a giant skeleton with a spear inside of it, a character named \"The Giant\", in the castle the player can discover that The Giant was murdered on the King's orders.\n\nA soldier implies that they have been trying to escape for an unspecified period of time. As the Prisoner works their way out of the Prison Quarters, they navigate the Island, and it is revealed to the player that the Island was once a mighty kingdom, until a plague known as \"The Malaise\" swept through, reducing most of its citizens to mindless zombies or monstrous husks. The Kingdom's Alchemist worked tirelessly to find a cure, but mysteriously disappeared as the king himself became reclusive. As the kingdom fell, the remaining citizens began to rebel against the King, only to either die by infection, seclusion, or by their own hands.\n\nOnce the prisoner dies, the giant skeleton disappears, and the soldier that told you about your previous escape attempts is found dead, and her body decays with each subsequent run.\n\nThe Prisoner encounters and fights several entities as they travel across the island: The Concierge, who was once the prison's guard Castaing, before his infection and subsequent transformation into a hulking monster; Conjonctivius, a nameless, faceless bloated corpse that was transformed into a grotesque tentacled Beholder-like monster; and The Time Keeper, a woman with some mastery over time, who continuously resets time each day to prevent her own infection. They also encounter The Collector, a hooded figure who trades items to the Prisoner in exchange for Cells, which drop from defeated enemies and are implied to be a sort of essence of life; and The Blacksmith and his apprentices, who upgrade the Prisoner's weapons and arsenal.\n\nEventually, the Prisoner reaches the castle's throne room, and faces off against the Hand of the King, while the King sits seemingly comatose upon his throne. The Prisoner defeats the Hand of the King, takes his weapon, and uses it to kill the King. The King's body violently explodes, destroying the Prisoner's host body and resetting the game, though giving the Prisoner the ability to act outside of a host body while still possessing the body. As the Prisoner's head returns to the quarters to find a new corpse to possess, it remarks on how even though the king has died, nothing has changed.\n\nThe Rise of the Giant DLC adds additional content, including new endings. The Prisoner gains access to a new area of the Island, The Cavern, which now houses the titanic undead skeletal Giant, who acts as a new boss for the area. The Giant, upon defeating it, reveals that the Prisoner is actually the King himself, his soul split from his body by consequence of his and the Alchemist's experiments. As the Prisoner continues, The Time Keeper begins actively altering the timeline to prevent her own death. After defeating the Hand of the King again (who is once more alive, though the King's body is still destroyed), if the player has all five Boss Cells (Modifiers which make the game substantially more difficult, earned by beating the game on each difficulty) active, they are able to gain access to the Astrolab and the Observatory. There, the Prisoner can find the Collector, who is implied to be the King's Alchemist. The Collector reveals that he has been collecting Cells to create a Panacea, to cure the Malaise once and for all. The Collector however, upon drinking the Panacea, goes mad with power and attempts to kill the Prisoner to reset the game so they'll bring him more Cells. While fighting the Collector, the Prisoner drinks some of the Panacea, which, upon the Collector's death, causes the Prisoner's host body to evaporate, resetting the game once more.\n\nThis time however, the Time Keeper fully resets the timeline. This allows the Prisoner, upon reaching the throne room and defeating the Hand of the King, to possess the King, getting his original body back. However, the body is infected with the Malaise, and so to prevent his own decay, he continues to the Observatory to face the Collector again. This time, upon the Collector's defeat, the Panacea cures the King and binds his body and soul once more.\n\nThe King returns to his throne, where he remarks over a glass of wine that he was honestly having more fun crawling around the sewers, when, due to the Time Keeper's meddling, a time-displaced Prisoner arrives in the throne room. The King and the Prisoner face off, and begin to duel.\n\n==Development==\n{{external media|right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqD1g6ROP_0 The Making of Dead Cells, by Red Bull Gaming]}}\n''Dead Cells''{{'}}s developer [[Motion Twin]] had been developing games for the [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile gaming]] market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \"passion project\", a game that was \"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players.<ref name=\"vb\">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | title = Studio abandons free-to-play web and mobile games for passion project: Dead Cells | first = Stephanie | last = Chan | date = April 19, 2017 | accessdate = May 12, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211620/https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/19/studio-abandons-free-to-play-web-and-mobile-games-for-passion-project-dead-cells/ | archive-date = October 19, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Motion Twin had set out to make a follow-up to their browser game ''[[Die2Nite]]'', which was a cooperative [[tower defense]] game for up to forty players released in 2008; for most of the game, players would work together to form defenses around a town, and then during a night phase, wait to see if their town survived waves of attacks by zombies. Initially they wanted to have the sequel improved by allowing players to take actions and fight during the night phase, implementing [[free to play]] mechanics. While this version worked well with large number of players, Motion Twin found it was not very exciting for single players.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | title = Dead Cells is a perfect example of Early Access done right | first = Jody | last = Macgregor | date = August 11, 2018 | accessdate = August 13, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180812083820/https://www.pcgamer.com/dead-cells-is-a-perfect-example-of-early-access-done-right/ | archive-date = August 12, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In 2014, they stripped down the game to basically a single-player experience between preparation and combat, and took it to an event called the Big Indie Pitch, where the idea came in second place. Inspired by this, they decided to strip away the game's preparation phase and focus it as a combat-based game. The process of figuring out how to keep and work from these combat elements took about a year up through the end of 2015.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\"/>\n\nTo tighten the gameplay, Motion Twin took inspiration of the Engineer class from ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took ''Dead Cells'' into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach).<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game.<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/> Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get. That\u2019s the fun of the game.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299848/Designing_each_of_the_50_weapons_in_Dead_Cells_to_feel_distinctive.php | title = Designing each of the 50 weapons in Dead Cells to feel distinctive | first = Joel | last = Couture | date = July 7, 2017 | accessdate = July 7, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170707214608/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299848/Designing_each_of_the_50_weapons_in_Dead_Cells_to_feel_distinctive.php | archive-date = July 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> To give the player enough options, the developers crafted about 50 different weapons, avoiding having too much duplication in how each weapon worked so that there would be unique gameplay possibilities with each. The team used an iterative process in gameplay and graphics and art so that each of these weapons also exhibited unique animations or behavior so that the player would get a sense of a tactile response and the special nature of each weapon.<ref name=\"gamasutra dev\"/>\n\nMotion Twin opted to use [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[Early access]] approach to both gauge interest and to get real-time feedback from players on game features and the balance from procedural generation.<ref name=\"vb\"/> They also feared the stigma around indie games at the time, fueled by industry speculation of an \"indiepocalypse\" where too many indie games would have caused a collapse of the games market around 2015, but which never occurred.<ref name=\"gamasutra balance\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/325547/Tuning_Dead_Cells_to_appeal_to_players_both_fast_and_slow.php | title = Tuning Dead Cells to appeal to players both fast and slow |first = Carli | last=  Velocci | date = August 31, 2018 | accessdate = August 31, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> They did not want to release too early within early access, and made sure the first version available, while only about 30 to 40% complete, had tight combat and gameplay controls that players would appreciate.<ref name=\"pcgamer dev\"/> Early access also allowed them to address balance issues, as they did not want to punish players for a specific style of play, and used the feedback to address this.

Other ideas included a [[condominium]] construction set. He noted the reverse [[gender roles]] where the men are \"the objects\" as \"opposed to the other way around\" and the many interpretations of work, which he says aided in the song's success.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=C.

As the man walks, Camila sings while resting her arm in a shovel. Multiple workers are shown working around the area as well. As Camila makes her way towards a tractor, the verse switches to Normani, who is standing on a tractor shovel loader. Normani dances near the tractor, approaching a male worker who is sitting in the driver's seat of the vehicle.\n\nThe group is now in front of the construction house, all performing in-sync dance choreography. Some of the dance routines include mimicking the visual to a [[jackhammer]] and using a driller. Ally is seen inside the house with a hammer, as she approaches a male construction worker, turning him around by gently grabbing his shirt and flirting with him. In the next scene, Dinah is standing by a wall, and makes her way towards another male worker, opening a blueprint map, and using a [[tape measure]]. The scene then shifts to Lauren, who is handling a [[blow torch]].\n\nAll the girls are then seen performing dance routines inside the hall of the house, with Lauren in the middle and two girls at each side of the staircase. Ty Dolla Sign appears while singing with a sledgehammer over his shoulders. He is seen for the first time together with the group, leaning against a wall, while the girls dance off-cam and perform [[twerking]] moves. The girls are now outside of the house, where night has approached, as each girl performs synchronized dance moves.\n\n===Reception and analysis===\nIn an article published by ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'', Robbie Daw praised the video for reversing the patronizing role men have and notes the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] inspired video direction, saying the group \"appears to now be in full control of their collective sexuality and wielding it as they choose, rather than relying on it solely to sell records.\" Carl Whilliott praised the group for establishing the video as \"their own\", commenting on how this style of video typically suits Ty Dolla Sign. He, however, criticized the song for not receiving as much criticism as Rihanna's song, \"Work\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7624892/pop-perspective-fifth-harmony-work-from-home-rated-reviewed|title=Pop Perspective: Fifth Harmony's \"Work From Home\" Rated And Reviewed|work=Idolator}}</ref>\n\nRebecca H.

Other ideas included a [[condominium]] construction set. He noted the reverse [[gender roles]] where the men are \"the objects\" as \"opposed to the other way around\" and the many interpretations of work, which he says aided in the song's success.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=C.

As the man walks, Camila sings while resting her arm in a shovel. Multiple workers are shown working around the area as well. As Camila makes her way towards a tractor, the verse switches to Normani, who is standing on a tractor shovel loader. Normani dances near the tractor, approaching a male worker who is sitting in the driver's seat of the vehicle.\n\nThe group is now in front of the construction house, all performing in-sync dance choreography. Some of the dance routines include mimicking the visual to a [[jackhammer]] and using a driller. Ally is seen inside the house with a hammer, as she approaches a male construction worker, turning him around by gently grabbing his shirt and flirting with him. In the next scene, Dinah is standing by a wall, and makes her way towards another male worker, opening a blueprint map, and using a [[tape measure]]. The scene then shifts to Lauren, who is handling a [[blow torch]].\n\nAll the girls are then seen performing dance routines inside the hall of the house, with Lauren in the middle and two girls at each side of the staircase. Ty Dolla Sign appears while singing with a sledgehammer over his shoulders. He is seen for the first time together with the group, leaning against a wall, while the girls dance off-cam and perform [[twerking]] moves. The girls are now outside of the house, where night has approached, as each girl performs synchronized dance moves.\n\n===Reception and analysis===\nIn an article published by ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'', Robbie Daw praised the video for reversing the patronizing role men have and notes the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] inspired video direction, saying the group \"appears to now be in full control of their collective sexuality and wielding it as they choose, rather than relying on it solely to sell records.\" Carl Whilliott praised the group for establishing the video as \"their own\", commenting on how this style of video typically suits Ty Dolla Sign. He, however, criticized the song for not receiving as much criticism as Rihanna's song, \"Work\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7624892/pop-perspective-fifth-harmony-work-from-home-rated-reviewed|title=Pop Perspective: Fifth Harmony's \"Work From Home\" Rated And Reviewed|work=Idolator}}</ref>\n\nRebecca H.

Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R. Ford, First Secretary Edward Gierek of Poland, and Mrs. Stanislawa Gierek Waving from the Blue Room Balcony during a State Arrival Ceremony - NARA - 7462054.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gierek in the [[White House]] with President [[Gerald Ford]], 1974]]\nWhen [[Edward Gierek]] succeeded [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] as the head of state in 1970, he took decisive measures to boost economic growth and develop modern infrastructure. Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> In November 1980, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] planned to potentially facilitate around 12,900 members of the opposition in state prisons and places of internment. \n\nOn 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Summit]] in [[Moscow]]. He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed.

I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived.

Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary.

He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliamentary]] commission in the years 1989\u20131991 arrived at a figure of over 90.<ref>[http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html Ofiary stanu wojennego i lat nast\u0119pnych do 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144638/http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html |date=2014-01-08 }} by Piotr Lipi\u0144ski</ref> In the deadliest incident, nine coal miners were killed by: \"[[ZOMO]]\" paramilitary police during the [[strike-breaking]] at the [[Pacification of Wujek]] on 16 December 1981.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions.

I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Polish 1970 protests]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]\n* [[Romanian Revolution]], 1989\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIntroduction, restrictions, patrols:disamb.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"}

Seven regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed, while its Supply Division\u2014based in [[Copenhagen]] and [[New York City|New York\u2014]]<nowiki/>helps provide over $3 billion in critical aid and services.<ref name=\"SD\"/> \n\nIn 2018,  UNICEF assisted in the birth of 27 million babies, administered [[Pentavalent vaccine|Pentavalent vaccines]] to an estimated 65.5 million children, provided education for 12 million children, treated four million children with [[Severe Acute Malnutrition|severe acute malnutrition]], and responded to 285 humanitarian emergencies in 90 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/reports/annual-report-2018|title=UNICEF annual report 2018|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> UNICEF had received recognition for its work, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1965, the [[Indira Gandhi Prize]] in 1989 and the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Princess of Asturias Award]] in 2006.\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Sudan Envoy - UNICEF Tent.jpg|250px|thumb|UNICEF-care tent in [[Sudan]]]]\nUNICEF relies on country offices to help carry out its work through a unique program of cooperation developed with the host government. The programs last five years and seek to develop practical strategies for fulfilling and protecting the rights of children and women. Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place its New York headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped. \n\nGuiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is an Executive Board made up of 36 members who are government representatives. The Board establishes policies, approve programs and decide on administrative and financial plans and budgets. Its work is coordinated by the Bureau, comprising the President and four Vice-Presidents, each officer representing one of the five regional groups. These five officers are elected by the Executive Board annually from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board. \n\nThe Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board helps maintain an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and organizes field visits by board members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/|title=How UNICEF works|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/|title=Home|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/index_13225.html|title=Bureau|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref>[[File:1 school in a box.jpg|thumb|right|UNICEF ''School in a box'' contains basic educational items for one teacher and 40 students]]\n\n===UNICEF Regional Offices===\n\nThe following countries are home to UNICEF Regional Offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/index_regional.html|title=UNICEF Regional Offices\n|date=2017-09-27|access-date=2020-02-26|work=UNICEF}}</ref>\n\n* The Americas and Caribbean Regional Office, [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]\n* Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]\n* East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office, [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n* Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]\n* Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]\n* South Asia Regional Office, [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]\n* West and Central Africa Regional Office, [[Senegal]]\n\n==UNICEF national committees==\n{{see also|List of UNICEF National Committees}}\nThere are national committees in 36 developed countries, each established as an independent local [[non-governmental organization]].
