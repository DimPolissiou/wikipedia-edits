As was customary at the time, as populations increased, other counties were organized from its land area. Woodward Avenue and the [[Detroit and Pontiac Railroad]] helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty lumber mills, processing wood harvested from the region and the Upper Peninsula. Pontiac, located on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], was Oakland's first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was still primarily a rural, agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th century, three rail lines served Pontiac, and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. In the late 1890s streetcars were constructed here and to Detroit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAt that time, developers made southern Oakland County a suburb of Detroit; a Cincinnati firm platted a section of Royal Oak called \"Urbanrest.\" Migration worked both ways. Several thousand people moved from Oakland County farms to Detroit as the city attracted factories. By 1910, a number of rich [[Detroit]]ers had summer homes and some year-round residences in what became Bloomfield Hills. The auto age enveloped Pontiac in the early 1900s. The [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland Motor Car Company]] was founded in 1907 and became a part of General Motors Corp., which was soon Pontiac's dominant firm.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the 1950s, the Detroit metropolitan population began migrating to the suburbs, aided by the GI Bill for veterans and federal subsidies for highways and freeways.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Oakland County is among the ten highest-income counties in the United States with more than one million population.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The median price of a home in Oakland County increased to $164,697, more than $30,000 above the national median. Oakland County is home to popular super-regional shopping malls such as [[Somerset Collection]], [[Twelve Oaks Mall]], and [[Great Lakes Crossing Outlets]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOn March 10, 2020, Michigan reported the first 2 coronavirus cases, one of which was in Oakland County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|907|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|868|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|40|sqmi}} (4.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113024015/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOakland County was originally divided into 25 separate [[townships]], which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at six miles (10&nbsp;km) by six miles, for a total township area of {{convert|36|sqmi|km2}}.  The roots of this design were born out of the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and the subsequent [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.  Oakland County itself is a prime example of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to waterways).  Section 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.\n\n[[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], where the city of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] is located, borders Oakland County to the south. [[8 Mile Road]], also known as \"Baseline Road\" in some areas, is the boundary between these counties.  The baseline was used during the original surveying for Michigan, and it serves as the northern/southern boundaries for counties from [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Michigan]]. As more working and middle-class populations moved to the suburbs from the 1950s on, this divide (8 Mile Road) became historically known as an unofficial racial dividing line between what became the predominantly [[Black people|black]] city and almost exclusively [[whites|white]] suburbs.\n\nSince the late 20th century, however, the patterns of ''de facto'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]] have faded as the suburbs have become more diverse. Middle-class African Americans have left the city, settling in inner-ring suburbs, notably Southfield (75.08%), west of [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]]. Based on the 2010 Census, the following cities also have significant minority ethnic populations: Farmington (25.3%), Farmington Hills (31.7%), Novi (30.12%), [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]] (62.61%), Lathrup Village (72.97%), Orchard Lake Village (16.08%), Rochester Hills (20.94%), Troy (29.4%), Wixom (26.28%), West Bloomfield (24.0%), Bloomfield (18.28%), Bloomfield Hills (14.2%), [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] (17.2%), and Madison Heights (17.7%). Ferndale has a concentration of [[Arab Americans]], who also live in nearby areas, and numerous [[Asian Americans]], particularly [[India]]ns, have also settled in these areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]] (northeast)\n*[[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] (northwest)\n*[[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] (east)\n*[[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] (southeast)\n*[[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] (southwest)\n*[[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] (west)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 330\n|1830= 4911\n|1840= 23646\n|1850= 31270\n|1860= 38261\n|1870= 40867\n|1880= 41537\n|1890= 41245\n|1900= 44792\n|1910= 49576\n|1920= 90050\n|1930= 211251\n|1940= 254068\n|1950= 396001\n|1960= 690259\n|1970= 907871\n|1980= 1011793\n|1990= 1083592\n|2000= 1194156\n|2010= 1202362\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1259201\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{citeweb|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml|title=QuickFacts|accessdate=April 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717015826/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/16055.html|archive-date=July 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=September 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811110448/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/|archivedate=August 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/mi190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215142038/http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/mi190090.txt|archivedate=February 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The [[county commission|county board of commissioners]] controls the budget but has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions&mdash;police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. &mdash; are the responsibility of individual cities and townships. Oakland County has an elected sheriff, and his or her law-enforcement services are used throughout the county. Fourteen cities/townships do not have municipal police forces, but rather contract with the sheriff for police services specific to the municipalities. For instance, the city of Rochester Hills does not have a \"Rochester Hills Police Department,\" but instead has an established sheriff substation in the city with deputies who are dedicated to that city only. That branch operates as the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, Rochester Hills substation. The sheriff operates in the same manner with other municipalities who opt not to have their own police agencies. This typically is a cost-effective way for municipalities to provide police services to its citizens.  The county sheriff also maintains a civil division, marine division, alcohol and traffic enforcement units, and an aviation division.\n\n===Elected officials===\n* [[County Executive]]: [[David Coulter (politician)|Dave Coulter]] (Democrat){{ref|a}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/03/l-brooks-patterson-oakland-county-gerald-poisson/1909186001/|title=L.

However, since the 1990s it has become more competitive and has voted for the Democratic candidate for President in the last six elections.\n\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton became the first Democrat to secure the plurality of Oakland County presidential votes since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and only the fourth to do so since 1892. Al Gore and John Kerry also carried the county, by narrow margins, against George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, respectively. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win a majority in the county since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. (''See table at right''.) He again carried the county in 2012, though by a smaller margin.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party has found increasing success in Presidential elections in Oakland County, the state Republican Party has remained strong in recent gubernatorial and state elections. The county favored Governor [[Rick Snyder]] (R) by a 22-percent margin in the [http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/22923/42960/en/summary.html 2010] statewide elections and again by a 12-point margin in [http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/54212/149511/en/summary.html 2014]. While Republicans held a majority on the County Commission for most of its history, following the 2018 elections, there are 11 Democrats and 10 Republicans.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/news/elections/oakland-county-board-of-commissioners-majority-democratic-for-third-time/article_04063cb6-e2a4-11e8-b25c-530fb554a487.html|title=Oakland County Board of Commissioners majority Democratic for third time in history|last=Cavitt|first=Mark|date=November 7, 2018|publisher=[[The Oakland Press]]|accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[116th United States Congress|116th Congress]], Oakland County is represented by four Democrats, [[Brenda Lawrence]] ([[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th]]), [[Andy Levin]] ([[Michigan's 9th congressional district|9th]]), [[Haley Stevens]] ([[Michigan's 11th congressional district|11th]]) and [[Elissa Slotkin]] ([[Michigan's 8th congressional district|8th]]).

Reuther]] Freeway}} runs east-west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit.  Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|24}} ends just outside of Clarkston at I-75. To the south, US 24 serves suburban Detroit and [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] before entering [[Ohio]]. Much of US 24 in Oakland County is named Telegraph Road, and it is a major north-south road extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]], through Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. It gained notoriety in a song (''Telegraph Road'') by the group [[Dire Straits]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|1|name1=Woodward Avenue}} has a northern terminus in Pontiac. The route continues southerly from Oakland County into the City of Detroit, ending downtown. The Detroit Zoo is located along M-1 in Oakland County.  M-1 is also home to the [[Woodward Dream Cruise]], a classic-car cruise from Pontiac to [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] that is held in August. It is the largest single-day classic-car cruise in America.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|5}}\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|10|name1=[[John C.

To the north, the route continues to [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and beyond. Note: M-24 and US 24 do not intersect at present, although this was the case until the 1950s.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|39|name1=Southfield Freeway}} runs north-south from I-94 in Allen Park to Southfield.  North of Nine Mile Road, the freeway ends and continues as Southfield Road into Birmingham.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|59}} (Highland Road [from Pontiac westerly], Huron Street [within Pontiac] and Veterans Memorial Freeway [Pontiac to [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]]]), continues east in Macomb County as Hall Road to [[Clinton Charter Township, Michigan|Clinton Township]] and west to I-96 near [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|102}} Perhaps better known as 8 Mile Road, M-102 follows the Oakland\u2013Wayne county line for most of its length. 8 Mile Road, known by many due to the film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. It is also known as Baseline Road outside of Detroit, because it coincides with the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also the boundary for a number of Michigan counties. It is designated M-102 for much of its length in Wayne County.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|150|name1=Rochester Road}} serves as a spur highway from M-59 into the city of Rochester.\n*[[Grand River Avenue]] connects the suburbs of Brighton, Novi, and Farmington to downtown Detroit. The avenue follows the route of old [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] before I-96 replaced it in 1962. It is one of the five roads planned by Judge August Woodward to radiate out from Detroit and connect the city to other parts of the state.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Wolverine (train)|Wolverine]] serves Oakland County with 3 daily trains each way, stopping in [[Pontiac Transportation Center|Pontiac]], [[Troy Transit Center|Troy]], [[Royal Oak station (Michigan)|Royal Oak]], and continuing on to [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]].\n\n===Mile roads===\n{{Main|Mile Road System (Detroit)}}\n*Surface-street navigation in metro Detroit is commonly anchored by \"mile roads,\" major east-west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (e.g., 15 Mile Road), used in Macomb County, and a local name (e.g., Maple Road), used in Oakland County (for the most part).\n\n===Bicycling===\nThe conditions on most non-residential roads in Oakland County are not favorable to bicycling. Exceptions to this are primarily in the inner-ring suburbs within the southeast corner of the county.

As was customary at the time, as populations increased, other counties were organized from its land area. Woodward Avenue and the [[Detroit and Pontiac Railroad]] helped draw settlers in the 1840s. By 1840, Oakland had more than fifty lumber mills, processing wood harvested from the region and the Upper Peninsula. Pontiac, located on the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]], was Oakland's first town and became the county seat. After the Civil War, Oakland was still primarily a rural, agricultural county with numerous isolated villages. By the end of the 19th century, three rail lines served Pontiac, and the city attracted carriage and wagon factories. In the late 1890s streetcars were constructed here and to Detroit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAt that time, developers made southern Oakland County a suburb of Detroit; a Cincinnati firm platted a section of Royal Oak called \"Urbanrest.\" Migration worked both ways. Several thousand people moved from Oakland County farms to Detroit as the city attracted factories. By 1910, a number of rich [[Detroit]]ers had summer homes and some year-round residences in what became Bloomfield Hills. The auto age enveloped Pontiac in the early 1900s. The [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland Motor Car Company]] was founded in 1907 and became a part of General Motors Corp., which was soon Pontiac's dominant firm.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the 1950s, the Detroit metropolitan population began migrating to the suburbs, aided by the GI Bill for veterans and federal subsidies for highways and freeways.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Oakland County is among the ten highest-income counties in the United States with more than one million population.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The median price of a home in Oakland County increased to $164,697, more than $30,000 above the national median. Oakland County is home to popular super-regional shopping malls such as [[Somerset Collection]], [[Twelve Oaks Mall]], and [[Great Lakes Crossing Outlets]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOn March 10, 2020, Michigan reported the first 2 coronavirus cases, one of which was in Oakland County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|907|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|868|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|40|sqmi}} (4.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 27, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113024015/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_26.txt|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOakland County was originally divided into 25 separate [[townships]], which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at six miles (10&nbsp;km) by six miles, for a total township area of {{convert|36|sqmi|km2}}.  The roots of this design were born out of the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and the subsequent [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.  Oakland County itself is a prime example of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to waterways).  Section 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.\n\n[[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], where the city of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] is located, borders Oakland County to the south. [[8 Mile Road]], also known as \"Baseline Road\" in some areas, is the boundary between these counties.  The baseline was used during the original surveying for Michigan, and it serves as the northern/southern boundaries for counties from [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Michigan]]. As more working and middle-class populations moved to the suburbs from the 1950s on, this divide (8 Mile Road) became historically known as an unofficial racial dividing line between what became the predominantly [[Black people|black]] city and almost exclusively [[whites|white]] suburbs.\n\nSince the late 20th century, however, the patterns of ''de facto'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]] have faded as the suburbs have become more diverse. Middle-class African Americans have left the city, settling in inner-ring suburbs, notably Southfield (75.08%), west of [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]].

The [[county commission|county board of commissioners]] controls the budget but has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions&mdash;police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. &mdash; are the responsibility of individual cities and townships. Oakland County has an elected sheriff, and his or her law-enforcement services are used throughout the county. Fourteen cities/townships do not have municipal police forces, but rather contract with the sheriff for police services specific to the municipalities. For instance, the city of Rochester Hills does not have a \"Rochester Hills Police Department,\" but instead has an established sheriff substation in the city with deputies who are dedicated to that city only. That branch operates as the Oakland County Sheriff's Department, Rochester Hills substation. The sheriff operates in the same manner with other municipalities who opt not to have their own police agencies. This typically is a cost-effective way for municipalities to provide police services to its citizens.  The county sheriff also maintains a civil division, marine division, alcohol and traffic enforcement units, and an aviation division.\n\n===Elected officials===\n* [[County Executive]]: [[David Coulter (politician)|Dave Coulter]] (Democrat){{ref|a}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/03/l-brooks-patterson-oakland-county-gerald-poisson/1909186001/|title=L.

Al Gore and John Kerry also carried the county, by narrow margins, against George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, respectively. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win a majority in the county since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. (''See table at right''.) He again carried the county in 2012, though by a smaller margin.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party has found increasing success in Presidential elections in Oakland County, the state Republican Party has remained strong in recent gubernatorial and state elections.

Young International Airport|Coleman A. Young International Airport (DET)]] (Detroit) - General aviation only. This airport is in Wayne County in the city of [[Detroit]].\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|75|name1=[[Walter Chrysler|Walter P. Chrysler]] Freeway}} is the main north-south highway in the region, serving Flint, Pontiac, Troy, and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Fisher and Detroit-Toledo Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of [[Lake Erie]].\n*{{jct|country=USA|I|96}} runs northwest-southeast through Oakland County and (as the Jeffries Freeway) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|I|275}} runs north-south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and I-696 in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit.\n*{{jct|country=USA|I|696|name1=[[Walter Reuther|Walter P. Reuther]] Freeway}} runs east-west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit.  Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit.\n*{{jct|state=MI|US|24}} ends just outside of Clarkston at I-75. To the south, US 24 serves suburban Detroit and [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] before entering [[Ohio]]. Much of US 24 in Oakland County is named Telegraph Road, and it is a major north-south road extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]], through Monroe, Wayne, and Oakland Counties to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. It gained notoriety in a song (''Telegraph Road'') by the group [[Dire Straits]].\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|1|name1=Woodward Avenue}} has a northern terminus in Pontiac. The route continues southerly from Oakland County into the City of Detroit, ending downtown. The Detroit Zoo is located along M-1 in Oakland County.  M-1 is also home to the [[Woodward Dream Cruise]], a classic-car cruise from Pontiac to [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] that is held in August. It is the largest single-day classic-car cruise in America.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|5}}\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|10|name1=[[John C. Lodge]] Freeway}} runs largely parallel to I-75 from Southfield to downtown Detroit.  The service drives are named Northwestern Highway.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|15}} (Ortonville Road, Main Street in Clarkston)\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|24|name1=Lapeer Road}} has a southern terminus at I-75 northeast of Pontiac. To the north, the route continues to [[Lapeer, Michigan|Lapeer]] and beyond. Note: M-24 and US 24 do not intersect at present, although this was the case until the 1950s.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|39|name1=Southfield Freeway}} runs north-south from I-94 in Allen Park to Southfield.  North of Nine Mile Road, the freeway ends and continues as Southfield Road into Birmingham.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|59}} (Highland Road [from Pontiac westerly], Huron Street [within Pontiac] and Veterans Memorial Freeway [Pontiac to [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]]]), continues east in Macomb County as Hall Road to [[Clinton Charter Township, Michigan|Clinton Township]] and west to I-96 near [[Howell, Michigan|Howell]]\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|102}} Perhaps better known as 8 Mile Road, M-102 follows the Oakland\u2013Wayne county line for most of its length. 8 Mile Road, known by many due to the film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', forms the dividing line between Detroit on the south and the suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties on the north. It is also known as Baseline Road outside of Detroit, because it coincides with the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] used in surveying Michigan; that baseline is also the boundary for a number of Michigan counties. It is designated M-102 for much of its length in Wayne County.\n*{{jct|state=MI|M|150|name1=Rochester Road}} serves as a spur highway from M-59 into the city of Rochester.\n*[[Grand River Avenue]] connects the suburbs of Brighton, Novi, and Farmington to downtown Detroit. The avenue follows the route of old [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]] before I-96 replaced it in 1962. It is one of the five roads planned by Judge August Woodward to radiate out from Detroit and connect the city to other parts of the state.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Amtrak]]'s [[Wolverine (train)|Wolverine]] serves Oakland County with 3 daily trains each way, stopping in [[Pontiac Transportation Center|Pontiac]], [[Troy Transit Center|Troy]], [[Royal Oak station (Michigan)|Royal Oak]], and continuing on to [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]].\n\n===Mile roads===\n{{Main|Mile Road System (Detroit)}}\n*Surface-street navigation in metro Detroit is commonly anchored by \"mile roads,\" major east-west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (e.g., 15 Mile Road), used in Macomb County, and a local name (e.g., Maple Road), used in Oakland County (for the most part).\n\n===Bicycling===\nThe conditions on most non-residential roads in Oakland County are not favorable to bicycling. Exceptions to this are primarily in the inner-ring suburbs within the southeast corner of the county. This is due to their [[Grid plan|street grid]].\n\nA primary reason for these unfavorable cycling conditions is the [[Road Commission for Oakland County]] has a policy of not accommodating bicycles on the road. As a result, some communities have designated [[sidepath]]s (locally called \"safety paths\") as bike routes which do not meet the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) guidelines for bicycling facilities and have been found to be less safe than on-road bike facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.massbike.org/resources/stats.htm#sidewalk |title=Risk of Sidewalk and Wrong-way Riding |accessdate=March 17, 2007 |work=Bicyclist Injuries: Learning from the Statistics |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520071232/http://www.massbike.org/resources/stats.htm#sidewalk <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 20, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, there are no designated [[League of American Bicyclists#Bicycle Friendly Communities|Bicycle Friendly Communities]] within Oakland County.\n\nOnly the city of [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] has a built comprehensive bicycle network of [[bike lanes]] and signed shared roadways.\n\n==Education==\nThe County of Oakland counterpart in public education (K-12) is the [[Oakland Schools]], an [[Intermediate school district]].\n\n===Higher education===\nOakland County is home to several institutions of higher education.\n*[[Baker College]],  [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] campus\n*[[Oakland University]], [[Rochester, Michigan|Rochester]]\n*The [[Western Michigan University Thomas M.

The Silverdome was also the site of [[Super Bowl XVI]], where the [[San Francisco 49ers]] defeated the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], the first of 5 Super Bowl titles for the 49ers.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2017, prior to the move to [[Little Caesars Arena]] in Detroit, the [[Detroit Pistons]] played their home games at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] and from 1978 to 1988, they played at the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\nThe Pontiac Silverdome has also hosted various other sporting events since it opened.\n\n==Communities==\n[[File:Oakland County, MI census map2.png|thumb|right|500px|[[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data map showing local municipal boundaries within Oakland County.

This philosophy of quick manufacturing at an affordable price is used in large retailers such as [[H&M]], [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], [[C&A]], [[Peacocks (clothing)|Peacocks]], [[Primark]], and [[Topshop]]. It particularly came to the fore during the vogue for \"[[boho chic]]\" in the mid-2000s.<ref>See, for example, ''Sunday Times Style'', 17 September 2006</ref> According to the UK Environmental Audit Committee's report \"Fixing Fashion,\" fast fashion \"involves increased numbers of new fashion collections every year, quick turnarounds and often lower prices.

Oxford, Elsevier</ref>\n\n=== Slow fashion counter ===\n\nThe [[slow fashion]] or conscious fashion movement has arisen in opposition to fast fashion, blaming it for [[Pollution in the fashion industry|pollution]] (both in the production of clothes and in the decay of synthetic fabrics), poor workmanship, and emphasizing very brief trends over classic style.<ref>Cline, Elizabeth L.

Cline's 2012 book ''Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion'' was one of the first investigations into the human and environmental toll of fast fashion. Fast fashion has also come under criticism for contributing to poor [[working conditions]] in [[developing countries]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Taplin | first1 = Ian M. | year = 2014 | title = Who is to blame?: A re-examination of fast fashion after the 2013 factory disaster in Bangladesh | url = | journal = Critical Perspectives on International Business | volume = 10 | issue = 1/2| pages = 72\u201383 | doi = 10.1108/cpoib-09-2013-0035 }}</ref> The [[2013 Savar building collapse]] in Bangladesh in 2013, the deadliest garment-related accident in world history,  brought more attention to the safety impact of the fast fashion industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hobson|first1=J.|title=To die for?

This efficiency is achieved through the retailers\u2019 understanding of the [[target market]]'s wants, which is a high fashion-looking garment at a price at the lower end of the [[clothing sector]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>  Primarily, the concept of [[category management]] has been used to align the retail buyer and the manufacturer in a more collaborative relationship.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sheridan | first1 = Mandy | last2 = Moore | first2 = Christopher | last3 = Nobbs | first3 = Karinna | year = 2006 | title = Fast fashion requires fast marketing: The role of category management in fast fashion positioning | url = | journal = Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 301\u201315 | doi=10.1108/13612020610679286}}</ref>  This collaboration occurs as many companies\u2019 resources are pooled to further develop more sophisticated and efficient supply chain models to increase the market's total profit. The fast fashion market utilizes this by uniting with foreign manufacturers to keep prices at a minimum.\n\n===Quick response method===\n[[Quick Response]] (QR) was developed to improve manufacturing processes in the textile industry with the aim of removing time from the production system.<ref>Hines, T. (2007) Supply Chain Strategies, Structures and Relationships, in Hines, T. and M.Bruce. Eds. Fashion Marketing Contemporary Issues 2nd Edn. Oxford, Elsevier</ref> The U.S. Apparel Manufacturing Association initiated the project in the early 1980s to address a competitive threat to its own textile manufactures from imported textiles in low labour cost countries.<ref>Hines, T. 2001. \"From analogue to digital supply chains: Implications for fashion marketing \" In Fashion marketing: Contemporary issues. Eds. T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 26-47.</ref> During the project lead times in the manufacturing process were halved; the U.S. industry became more competitive for a time, and imports were lowered as a result.<ref>Hunter, N.A.  . 1990. Quick Response in Apparel Manufacturing. Manchester The Textile Institute.</ref>\nThe QR initiative was viewed by many as a protection mechanism for the American textile industry with the aim of improving manufacturing efficiencies.<ref>Hines, T. (2004), Supply Chain Strategies: Customer Driven and Customer Focused, Oxford: Elsevier</ref>\n\nThe concept of quick response (QR) is now used to support \"fast fashion\", creating new, fresh products while also drawing consumers back to the retail experience for consecutive visits.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bruce | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Daly | first2 = Lucy | year = 2006 | title = Buyer behaviour for fast fashion | url = | journal = Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u201344 | doi=10.1108/13612020610679303}}</ref>  Quick response also makes it possible for new technologies to increase production and efficiency, typified by the introduction of the complementary concept of [[Fast Fit]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The Spanish mega chain [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], owned by [[Inditex]], has become the global model for how to decrease the time between design and production. This production short cut enables Zara to manufacture over 30,000 units of product every year to nearly 1,600 stores in 58 countries.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Pfeifer, Margarida O. \"Fast and Furious.\" Latin Trade (English) 15.9 (Sep. 2007): 14-14. Business Source Complete.</ref>  New items are delivered twice a week to the stores, reducing the time between initial sale and replenishment. As a result, the shortened time period improves consumer's garment choices and product availability while significantly increasing the number of per customer visits per annum. In the case of [[Renner (company)|Renner]], a Brazilian chain, a new mini-collection is released every two months.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[Marketing]] is the key driver of fast fashion. Marketing creates the desire for consumption of new designs as close as possible to the point of creation. Marketing closes the gap between creation and consumption by promoting this as something fast, low priced, and disposable.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/47608/|title = The life-cycle of the fashion garment and the role of Australian mass market designers|last = Payne|first = Alice|date = 2011|journal = The International Journal of Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability|volume = 7|pages = 237\u2013246|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref> The continuous release of new products essentially makes the garments a highly cost effective marketing tool that drives consumer visits, increases brand awareness, and results in higher rates of consumer purchases. Fast fashion companies have also enjoyed higher profit margins in that their markdown percentage is only 15% compared to competitors\u2019 30% plus. The fast fashion business model is based on reducing the time cycles from production to consumption such that consumers engage in more cycles in any time period. For example, the traditional fashion seasons followed the annual cycle of summer, autumn, winter and spring, but in fast fashion cycles have compressed into shorter periods of 4\u20136 weeks and in some cases less than this. Marketers have thus created more buying seasons in the same time-space.<ref>Hines, Tony. 2001. \"Globalization: An introduction to fashion markets and fashion marketing.\" In Fashion marketing: Contemporary issues. Eds. T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 1-24.</ref>  Two approaches are currently being used by companies as market strategies; the difference is the amount of financial capital spent on advertisements. While some companies invest in advertising, fast fashion mega firm [[Primark]] operates with no advertising. Primark instead invests in store layout, shopfit and [[visual merchandising]] to create an instant hook.<ref>Baker, Rosie. \"Following fast fashion.\" In-Store (June 2008): 37-39. Business Source Complete. [[EBSCO]].</ref>  The instant hook creates an enjoyable shopping experience, resulting in the continuous return of customers. Research shows that seventy five percent of consumer's decisions are made in front of the fixture within three seconds.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  The alternative spending of Primark also \"allows the retailer to pass the benefits of a cost saving back to the consumer and maintain the company's price structure of producing garments at a lower cost\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===\"Supermarket\" market===\nThe consumer in the fast fashion market thrives on constant change and the frequent availability of new products.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Fast fashion is considered to be a \"[[supermarket]]\" segment within the larger sense of the fashion market.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  This term refers to fast fashion's nature to \"race to make apparel an even smarter and quicker cash generator\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Three crucial differentiating model factors exist within fast fashion consumption: [[market timing]], cost, and the buying cycle.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Timing's objective is to create the shortest production time possible. The quick turnover has increased the demand for the number of seasons presented in the stores. This demand also increases shipping and restocking time periods.\nCost is still the consumer's primary [[buying decision]]. Costs are largely reduced by taking advantage of lower prices in markets in developing countries. In 2004 developing countries accounted for nearly seventy five percent of all clothing exports and the removal of several [[import quota]]s has allowed companies to take advantage of the even lower cost of resources.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\nThe buying cycle is the final factor that affects the consumer. Traditionally, fashion buying cycles are based around long term forecasts that occur one year to six months before the season.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Yet, in the fast fashion market the quick response philosophy can result in higher forecast accuracy because the time period is significantly shortened. A higher sell-through for the goods produced is also a result of the shortened production period.\n\n===Supply chain, vendor relationships and internal relationships===\n\n====Supply chain====\nSupply chains are central to the creation of fast fashion. Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hines | first1 = T | year = 2010 | title = Trends in textile global supply chains | url = | journal = Textiles | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201320 }}</ref> Efficient [[supply chains]] are critical to delivering the retail customer promise of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>  Two kinds of supply chains exist, [[agile enterprise|agile]] and [[lean manufacturing|lean]]. In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A lean supply chain is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The combination of the two supply chains is called ''\"[[leagile]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n====Vendor relationships====\nThe companies in the fast fashion market also utilize a range of relationships with the suppliers. The product is first classified as \"core\" or \"fashion\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Suppliers close to the market are used for products that are produced in the middle of a season, meaning trendy, \"fashion\" items. In comparison, long-distance suppliers are utilized for cheap, \"core\" items, sometimes referred to as \"capsule\" clothing, that are used in collections every season and have a stable forecast.\n\n====Internal relationships====\nProductive internal relationships within the fast fashion companies are as important as the company's relationships with external suppliers, especially when it comes to the company's buyers. Traditionally with a \"supermarket\" market the buying is divided into multi-functional departments. The buying team uses the bottom-up approach when trend information is involved, meaning the information is only shared with the company's fifteen top suppliers.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  On the other hand, information about future aims, and strategies of production are shared downward within the buyer [[hierarchy]] so the team can consider lower cost production options.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The buyers also interact closely with [[merchandising]] and design departments of the company because of the buyer's focus on style and color. The buyer must also consult with the overall design team to understand the cohesion between trend forecasting and consumer's wants. The close relationships result in flexibility within the company and an accelerated response speed to the demands of the market.\n\n====Sustainable labour costing and efficiency dilemma in fast fashion====\n\nPublished by University of Manchester, the Working Papers of \"Capturing the Gains, global summit\" brings together an international network of experts from North and South. The Working Paper 14 focuses on a specific feature of buying behaviour in the UK fashion retail industry: the negotiation of a manufacturing price (cut-make-trim, CMT, cost) with suppliers that does not separately itemize [[labour cost]]. This practice, tacitly supported by both buyers and suppliers, is examined against the backdrop of ongoing [[wage defaulting]] and import price [[deflation]] in the global apparel industry. For obvious reasons, the make-up of standard time using  [[Predetermined Time standard]]s (PTS), [[Predetermined motion time system]] (PMTS); is highly technical and \u2018synthetic\u2019. According to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems, offered by consultancies for adoption by manufacturing companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Work Study|year=1992|author=George Kanawaty|isbn= 978-9221071082|publisher=International Labour Office|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lHHB-3qayLUC}}</ref> In apparel manufacture, three PTS (aka PMTS) consultancy firms specializing in [[methods-time measurement]] (MTM) appear to be operating in the sector\u2013 the US-based Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards ([[MODAPTS]]), the Sri Lankan-based Seweasy and the UK-headquartered GSD (Corporate) Ltd. All three forms of work measurement for arriving at a standard time should normally make provision for relaxation, contingency and special allowances.\n\n==List of fast fashion brands==\n{{original research section|date=September 2019}}\n*[[ASOS.com]]<ref>https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/as-waste-plagues-the-fast-fashion-industry-asos-is-taking-a-step-toward-sustainability/</ref>\n*[[Bershka]]\n*[[Bestseller (company)|Bestseller]]\n*[[Boohoo.com]]\n*[[C&A]]\n*[[Charlotte Russe (clothing retailer)|Charlotte Russe]]\n*[[Cotton On]]\n*[[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]]\n*[[Fashion Nova]]\n*[[FIVE FOXes]]\n*[[Forever 21]]\n*[[Gap Inc.]]\n*[[Giordano (store)|Giordano]]\n*[[Guess (clothing)|Guess?]]\n*[[H&M]]\n*[[Inditex]]\n*[[Mango (clothing)]]\n*[[Massimo Dutti]]\n*[[Metersbonwe]]\n*[[Missguided]]\n*[[Miss Selfridge]]\n*[[Nasty Gal]]\n*[[New Look (company)|New Look]]\n*[[NewYorker]]\n*[[Next plc|Next]]\n*[[Oysho]]\n*[[Peacocks (clothing)|Peacocks]]\n*[[PrettyLittleThing]]\n*[[Primark]]\n*[[Pull & Bear]]\n*[[Rainbow Shops]]\n*[[Lojas Renner|Renner]]\n*[[Lojas Riachuelo|Riachuelo]]\n*[[River Island]]\n*[[s.

The fast fashion business model is based on reducing the time cycles from production to consumption such that consumers engage in more cycles in any time period. For example, the traditional fashion seasons followed the annual cycle of summer, autumn, winter and spring, but in fast fashion cycles have compressed into shorter periods of 4\u20136 weeks and in some cases less than this. Marketers have thus created more buying seasons in the same time-space.<ref>Hines, Tony. 2001. \"Globalization: An introduction to fashion markets and fashion marketing.\" In Fashion marketing: Contemporary issues. Eds. T. Hines and M. Bruce. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 1-24.</ref>  Two approaches are currently being used by companies as market strategies; the difference is the amount of financial capital spent on advertisements. While some companies invest in advertising, fast fashion mega firm [[Primark]] operates with no advertising. Primark instead invests in store layout, shopfit and [[visual merchandising]] to create an instant hook.<ref>Baker, Rosie. \"Following fast fashion.\" In-Store (June 2008): 37-39. Business Source Complete. [[EBSCO]].</ref>  The instant hook creates an enjoyable shopping experience, resulting in the continuous return of customers. Research shows that seventy five percent of consumer's decisions are made in front of the fixture within three seconds.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  The alternative spending of Primark also \"allows the retailer to pass the benefits of a cost saving back to the consumer and maintain the company's price structure of producing garments at a lower cost\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===\"Supermarket\" market===\nThe consumer in the fast fashion market thrives on constant change and the frequent availability of new products.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Fast fashion is considered to be a \"[[supermarket]]\" segment within the larger sense of the fashion market.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  This term refers to fast fashion's nature to \"race to make apparel an even smarter and quicker cash generator\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Three crucial differentiating model factors exist within fast fashion consumption: [[market timing]], cost, and the buying cycle.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Timing's objective is to create the shortest production time possible. The quick turnover has increased the demand for the number of seasons presented in the stores. This demand also increases shipping and restocking time periods.\nCost is still the consumer's primary [[buying decision]]. Costs are largely reduced by taking advantage of lower prices in markets in developing countries. In 2004 developing countries accounted for nearly seventy five percent of all clothing exports and the removal of several [[import quota]]s has allowed companies to take advantage of the even lower cost of resources.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\nThe buying cycle is the final factor that affects the consumer. Traditionally, fashion buying cycles are based around long term forecasts that occur one year to six months before the season.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Yet, in the fast fashion market the quick response philosophy can result in higher forecast accuracy because the time period is significantly shortened. A higher sell-through for the goods produced is also a result of the shortened production period.\n\n===Supply chain, vendor relationships and internal relationships===\n\n====Supply chain====\nSupply chains are central to the creation of fast fashion. Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hines | first1 = T | year = 2010 | title = Trends in textile global supply chains | url = | journal = Textiles | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 18\u201320 }}</ref> Efficient [[supply chains]] are critical to delivering the retail customer promise of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>  Two kinds of supply chains exist, [[agile enterprise|agile]] and [[lean manufacturing|lean]]. In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A lean supply chain is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The combination of the two supply chains is called ''\"[[leagile]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n====Vendor relationships====\nThe companies in the fast fashion market also utilize a range of relationships with the suppliers. The product is first classified as \"core\" or \"fashion\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  Suppliers close to the market are used for products that are produced in the middle of a season, meaning trendy, \"fashion\" items. In comparison, long-distance suppliers are utilized for cheap, \"core\" items, sometimes referred to as \"capsule\" clothing, that are used in collections every season and have a stable forecast.\n\n====Internal relationships====\nProductive internal relationships within the fast fashion companies are as important as the company's relationships with external suppliers, especially when it comes to the company's buyers. Traditionally with a \"supermarket\" market the buying is divided into multi-functional departments. The buying team uses the bottom-up approach when trend information is involved, meaning the information is only shared with the company's fifteen top suppliers.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  On the other hand, information about future aims, and strategies of production are shared downward within the buyer [[hierarchy]] so the team can consider lower cost production options.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>  The buyers also interact closely with [[merchandising]] and design departments of the company because of the buyer's focus on style and color. The buyer must also consult with the overall design team to understand the cohesion between trend forecasting and consumer's wants. The close relationships result in flexibility within the company and an accelerated response speed to the demands of the market.\n\n====Sustainable labour costing and efficiency dilemma in fast fashion====\n\nPublished by University of Manchester, the Working Papers of \"Capturing the Gains, global summit\" brings together an international network of experts from North and South. The Working Paper 14 focuses on a specific feature of buying behaviour in the UK fashion retail industry: the negotiation of a manufacturing price (cut-make-trim, CMT, cost) with suppliers that does not separately itemize [[labour cost]]. This practice, tacitly supported by both buyers and suppliers, is examined against the backdrop of ongoing [[wage defaulting]] and import price [[deflation]] in the global apparel industry. For obvious reasons, the make-up of standard time using  [[Predetermined Time standard]]s (PTS), [[Predetermined motion time system]] (PMTS); is highly technical and \u2018synthetic\u2019. According to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems, offered by consultancies for adoption by manufacturing companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Work Study|year=1992|author=George Kanawaty|isbn= 978-9221071082|publisher=International Labour Office|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lHHB-3qayLUC}}</ref> In apparel manufacture, three PTS (aka PMTS) consultancy firms specializing in [[methods-time measurement]] (MTM) appear to be operating in the sector\u2013 the US-based Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards ([[MODAPTS]]), the Sri Lankan-based Seweasy and the UK-headquartered GSD (Corporate) Ltd.

He released an album that spoke to teens, twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and beyond. Without compromising, the Chef made an edgy Hip Hop record that refused to bastardize the catalog he laid down 15 years ago.

Following this release, Raekwon resurrected talk of ''[[Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang]]'', a project announced in 2007, originally planned as a Wu-Tang album, minus RZA, due to his response to the previous group album ''[[8 Diagrams]]''. Raekwon forwarded his projects continuously through his growing label Icewater. He both worked on his own project while signing other underground artists.\n\nAlthough not a Wu-Tang Clan project, ''Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang'' was released in March 2011, serving as Raekwon's fifth solo LP.
