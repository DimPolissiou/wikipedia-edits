Lombard rule ended with the invasion of [[Charlemagne]] in 773, who established the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Papal States]]. This set the precedent for the main political conflict in Italy over the following centuries, between the [[Pope]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], culminating with conflict between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and the latter's \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" in 1077.\n\nThe term \"Middle Ages\" itself ultimately derives from the description of the period of \"obscurity\" in Italian history during the 9th to 11th centuries, the [[saeculum obscurum]] or \"Dark Age\" of the Roman papacy<ref>[[Will Durant]] refers to the period from 867 to 1049 as the \"nadir of the papacy\"</ref> as seen from the perspective of the 14th to 15th century [[Renaissance Humanism|Italian Humanists]].\n\nIn the 11th century began a political development unique to Italy, the transformation of [[medieval commune]]s into powerful [[Italian city-states|city states]] modelled on ancient [[Roman Republic]]anism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\nThe republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], among others, rose to great political power and paved the way for the [[Italian Renaissance]] and ultimately the \"[[European miracle]]\", the resurgence of [[Western civilization]] from comparative obscurity in the [[Early Modern period]]. On the other hand, the Italian city states were in a state of constant warfare, adding to and overlapping with the persistent conflict between the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. \nEach city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, [[Guelf]]s (loyal to the Pope) and [[Ghibelline]]s (loyal to the Emperor). Since the 13th century, these wars had increasingly been fought by [[mercenaries]], giving rise to the Italian institution of ''[[condottiere|condottieri]]'' and the [[Swiss mercenary]] culture.\nAfter the three decades of [[wars in Lombardy]] between the [[Duchy of Milan]] and the Republic of Venice, there was eventually a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] between five emerging powerful states, which at the [[Peace of Lodi]] formed the  so-called [[Italic League]], bringing relative calm for the region for the first time in centuries. \nThese five powers were the [[Republic of Venice|maritime republic of Venice]] and [[Republic of Florence]], whose naval powers dominated the east and west coast of the peninsula, respectively, the territorial powers of Milan and the Papal States, dominating the northern and central parts of Italy, respectively, and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in the south.\n\nThe precarious balance between these powers came to an end in 1494 as the duke of Milan [[Ludovico Sforza]] sought the aid of [[Charles VIII of France]] against Venice, triggering the [[Italian War of 1494\u201398]]. As a result, Italy became a battleground of the great European powers for the next sixty years, finally culminating in the [[Italian War of 1551\u201359]], which concluded with [[Habsburg Spain]] as the dominant power in Italy. The [[House of Habsburg]] would control Italy for the duration of the [[History of Italy (1559\u20131814)|early modern period]], until [[Napoleon]]'s [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|invasion of Italy]] in 1796. he also said hey boomer\n\n\n== Transition from Late Antiquity (6th to 8th centuries) ==\n{{further|Late Antiquity|Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom of the Lombards|Military history of Italy}}\n[[File:Odoacer Kingdom.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of Odoacer's Kingdom]]\nItaly was invaded by the [[Visigoths]] in the 5th century, and Rome was sacked by [[Alaric I|Alaric]] in 410. The (traditional) last Western [[Roman Emperor]], [[Romulus Augustus]], was deposed in 476 by an Eastern Germanic general, [[Odoacer]]. He subsequently ruled in Italy for seventeen years as ''rex gentium'', theoretically under the suzerainty of the eastern Roman emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], but practically in total independence. The administration remained essentially the same as that under the Western Roman Empire, and gave religious freedoms to the Christians. Odoacer fought against the Vandals, who had occupied [[Sicily]], and other Germanic tribes that periodically invaded the peninsula.\n\nIn 489, however, Emperor Zeno decided to oust the [[Ostrogoths]], a ''foederatum'' people living in the Danube, by sending them into Italy. On February 25, 493 [[Theodoric the Great]] defeated Odoacer and became the king of the Ostrogoths. Theodoric, who had lived long in Constantinople, is now generally considered a Romanized German, and he in fact ruled over Italy largely through Roman personnel. The Goth minority, of [[Arianism|Arian]] confession, constituted an aristocracy of landowners and militaries, but its influence over the country remained minimal; the Latin population was still subject to Roman laws, and maintained the freedom of creed received by Odoacer. The reign of Theodoric is generally considered a period of recovery for the country. Infrastructures were repaired, frontiers were expanded, and the economy well cared for. The Latin culture flourished for the last time with figures like [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], Theodoric's minister; the Italian Kingdom was again the most powerful political entity of the Mediterranean. However, Theodoric's successors were not equal to him.\n[[File:Empire of Theodoric the Great 523.gif|thumb|300px|right|The maximum extent of territories ruled by [[Theodoric the Great]] in 523.]]\nThe [[Byzantine Empire|eastern half of the Empire]], now centred on [[Constantinople]], invaded Italy in the early 6th century, and the generals of emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], [[Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], conquered the Ostrogothic kingdom after years of warfare, ending in 552. This conflict, known as the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic Wars]], destroyed much of the town life that had survived the barbarian invasions. Town life did not disappear, but they became smaller and considerably more primitive than they had been in Roman times. Subsistence agriculture employed the bulk of the Italian population. Wars, famines, and disease epidemics had a dramatic effect on the demographics of Italy.\nThe agricultural estates of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era did not disappear. They produced an agricultural surplus that was sold in towns; however slavery was replaced by other labour systems such as [[serfdom]].\n\nThe withdrawal of Byzantine armies allowed another Germanic people, the [[Lombards]], to invade Italy. [[Cividale del Friuli]] was the first main centre to fall, while the Byzantine resistance concentrated in the coast areas. The Lombards soon overran most of the peninsula, establishing a Kingdom with capital in [[Pavia]], divided into a series of dukedoms. The areas in central-northern Italy which remained under Byzantine control (mostly the current Lazio and [[Romagna]], plus a short corridor between Umbria that connected them, as well as [[Liguria]]) became the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. Southern Italy, with the exception of [[Apulia]], current [[Calabria]] and Sicily, were also occupied by the two semi-independent Lombard duchies of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]]. Under the Imperial authority remained also much of the ports, which eventually turned into actually independent city-states ([[Gaeta]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]], [[Amalfi]]).\n\n=== Rise of the Patriarchate of Rome ===\n[[File:Aistulf's Italy-it.svg|thumb|250px|left| Lombards domains after the conquests of [[Aistulf]] (751)]]\nThe Church (and especially the [[bishop]] of [[Rome]], by now styled the [[pope]]), had played an important political role since the time of Constantine, who tried to include it in the imperial administration.\n\nIn the politically unstable situation after the fall of the western empire, the Church often became the only stable institution and the only source of learning in western Europe. Even the barbarians had to rely on clerics in order to administer their conquests. Furthermore, the Catholic [[monasticism|monastic orders]], such as the [[Benedictine]]s had a major role both in the economic life of the time, and in the preservation of [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[culture]] (although in the east the Greek authors were much better preserved).\n\nAfter the Lombard invasion, the popes  were nominally subject to the eastern emperor, but often received little help from Constantinople, and had to fill the lack of stately power, providing essential services (ex. food for the needy) and protecting Rome from Lombard incursions; in this way, the popes started building an independent state.\n\n==Early Middle Ages (8th to 9th centuries)==\n{{further|Kingdom of Italy (medieval)}}\n\n=== Collapse of the Exarchate ===\nAt the end of the 8th century the popes definitely aspired to independence, and found a way to achieve it by allying with the [[Carolingian dynasty]] of the Franks: the Carolingians needed someone who could give legitimacy to a coup against the powerless [[Merovingian]] kings, while the popes needed military protection against the [[Lombards]].\n\nIn 751 the Lombards seized Ravenna and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] was abolished. This ended the Byzantine presence in central Italy (although some coastal cities and some areas in south Italy remained under Byzantine control until the 11th century). Facing a new Lombard offensive, the papacy appealed to the [[Franks]] for aid. In 756 Frankish forces defeated the Lombards and gave the Papacy legal authority over all of central Italy, thus creating the [[Papal States]]. However, the remainder of Italy stayed under Lombard (such as Benevento and Spoleto) or Byzantine (such as Calabria, Apulia and Sicily) control.\n\n===The Frankish (Carolingian) Empire===\n[[File:Empire carolingien 768-811.jpg|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Frankish Empire]]:<br>Blue = realm of [[Pippin III]] in 758,<br>Orange = expansion under [[Charlemagne]] until 814,<br>Yellow = [[marches]] and dependencies]]\nIn 774, upon a Papal invitation, the Franks invaded the Kingdom of Italy and finally annexed the Lombards; as a reward the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] received papal support. Later, on December 25, 800, Charlemagne was also crowned emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by the pope, triggering controversy and disputes over the [[Names of the Greeks|Roman name]]. A war between the two empires soon followed; in 812 the Byzantines agreed to recognize the existence of two Roman Empires in return for an assurance that the remaining Byzantine possessions in Italy would be uncontested.\n\nThroughout this period, some coastal regions, and all of southern Italy, remained under Byzantine or Lombard control. The Imperial authority never extended much south of the [[Italian Peninsula]]. Southern Italy was divided amongst the two Lombards duchies of [[Spoleto]] and [[Benevento]], who accepted Charlemagne's suzerainty only formally (812), and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Coastal cities like [[Gaeta]], [[Amalfi]], [[Naples]] on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and [[Venice]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]], were Latin-Greek enclaves who were becoming increasingly independent from Byzantium. A conquest of Benevento, otherwise, would have meant the total encompassment of the Papal territories, and probably Charlemagne thought it was good for his relationships with the Pope to avoid such a move.  The age of Charlemagne was  one of stability for Italy, though it was generally dominated by non-Italian interests. The separation with the Eastern world continued to increase. [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]] was the first Pope to date his Bulls from the year of Charlemagne's reign (795) instead of those of Byzantine emperors. This process of isolation from the Eastern Empire and connection with the Western world of France and Germany, which had started three centuries before, was completed at the beginning of the 9th centuries. Sicily, Calabria, Puglia and the marine cities were the main exceptions to this rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAfter the death of Charlemagne (814) the new empire soon disintegrated under his weak successors. The equilibrium created through the great emperor's charisma fell apart. This crisis was due also to the emergence of external forces, including the [[Saracen]] attacks and the rising power of the marine republics. Charlemagne had announced his division of the Empire in 806: the Lombard-Frank reign, together with [[Bavaria]] and [[Alamannia]], was to be handed over to his son [[Pepin of Italy]].\n\nAfter Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious]] died in 840, the [[treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the empire. Louis' eldest surviving son [[Lothair I]] became Emperor and ruler of the Central Franks. His three sons in turn divided this kingdom between them, and Northern Italy became the Kingdom of Italy under [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 839.\n\nThe first half of the 9th century saw other troubles for Italy as well. In 827, [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s known as [[Aghlabid]]s invaded and conquered [[Sicily]]; their descendants, the [[Kalbids]], ruled the island until 1053. In 846, Muslim Arabs invaded [[Rome]], looted [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and stole all the gold and silver in it. In response, [[Pope Leo IV]] started building the [[Leonine City|Leonine walls]] of the [[Vatican City]] in 847; they were completed in 853. In the late 9th century, the Byzantines and the Franks launched a joint offensive against the Arabs in southern Italy; however, only the Byzantines won any territory in that campaign.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n=== Southern Italy ===\n{{further|Duchy of Benevento|History of Islam in southern Italy|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}\n\nWith Charlemagne's conquest of 774, the north of Italy was politically separated from the south completely. Though the Byzantines had continued to hold most of Apulia and Calabria and the Lombard duchies of the south had been aloof of Pavian policies for a century, the situation was exacerbated by the loss of a centralising Lombard authority in the north. Immediately, the duke of Benevento, [[Arechis II of Benevento|Arechis II]], proclaimed himself a sovereign prince and set about opposing Charlemagne's assumption of Lombard kingship.\n\n==== Creation of independent moieties (774\u2013849) ====\nUnder Arechis and his successors, it was the Beneventan policy to pay homage to the Carolingian emperors but ignore their rulings. As a result, ''De facto'' independence was achieved from Frankish as well as Byzantine authority. The [[Duchy of Benevento]] reached its territorial peak under [[Sicard of Benevento|Sicard]] in the 830s. At his time, the Mezzogiorno was suffering the ravages of the [[Saracen]]s, against whom Sicard warred constantly. He also warred against his Greek neighbours, especially [[Duchy of Sorrento|Sorrento]], [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]. It was in a war with Naples that [[Andrew II of Naples|Duke Andrew II]] first called in [[Saracen]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\nIn 839, Sicard was assassinated and a civil war broke out which illustrated the nature of political power in the south. It was still largely in the hands of the land-owning aristocracy, who had the power to choose a prince. In 839, some chose [[Radelchis I of Benevento|Radelchis I]], the treasurer and assassin, and some chose [[Siconulf of Salerno]], who was installed at [[Salerno]]. This civil war continued apace for a decade, during which the [[Gastald|gastaldates]] of Benevento took the opportunity to entrench their independence, especially [[Principality of Capua|Capua]], which sided with Siconulf. In 849, the [[Louis II of Italy|Emperor Louis II]], in one of his first acts as [[List of Italian monarchs|King of Italy]], invaded the peninsula and imposed peace between the Lombard factions. He divided the principality into two: one at Benevento, one at Salerno. Thenceforward, the history of the Lombard south is one of declining, competing powers.\n\n[[File:ItriCastello3.jpg|thumb|Castle of [[Itri]], probably dating from Docibilis I's reign.]]\n\nIn the [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] Greek cities, the violence raging inland, between them and their fellow Greeks on toe and heel, fostered the circumstances of ''de facto'' independence. Naples, in particular, had a history of differences with Byzantium and had in the past sought to make herself dependent on other authorities, often papal. In 801, the Byzantine [[patricianship|patrician]] of Sicily succeeded in creating [[Anthimus of Naples|Anthimus]] duke. However, Anthimus was unable to control the cities under his rule, Gaeta and Amalfi. Subsequent to Anthimus, the patrician tried to appoint his own candidate without imperial approval. The people rebelled and accepted [[Stephen III of Naples|Stephen III]] in 821. During Stephen's decade of rule, Naples severed all legal ties to Constantinople and even began minting her own coins. In 840, after a brief flirtation with Frankish servitude, to [[Lothair I]], and a Frankish duke, in the person of [[Contardus of Naples|Duke Contard]], the Neapolitan citizenry elected [[Sergius I of Naples|Sergius I]] their ''[[magister militum]]''. Sergius established a dynasty, the [[Serge (first name)|Sergi]], that was to rule the duchy for the next three hundred years.\n\nIn Gaeta, as in Naples, the violent situation inland required new power structures to maintain Byzantine authority. The Gaetans received their first imperial Byzantine ''[[hypatus|hypati]]'' around the time of the Beneventan civil war. While the first ''hypati'' remained Byzantine loyals, in 866, the sudden appearance of a new dynasty under [[Docibilis I of Gaeta|Docibilis I]] represented Gaeta's move from Byzantium towards independence. The first elected [[List of Dukes of Amalfi|ruler of Amalfi]] was a ''[[prefect]]'' appearing in 839, simultaneous with the death of Sicard and the appearance of a Gaetan ''hyaptus''. However, Naples, Gaeta, Amalfi, the Tyrrhenian cities, and Venice (in North Italy) retained some allegiance to Byzantium until the 11th century-long after becoming ''de facto'' independent.\n\n==== Period of confusion (849\u2013915) ====\nThe period following the Beneventan civil war was one of confusion, brought on by the independence movements in the various cities and provinces and by the Saracen onslaught. In Salerno, a palace coup removed Siconulf's successor [[Sico of Salerno|Sico II]] in 853 and destabilised that principality until a new dynasty, the Dauferidi, came to power in 861.\n\n[[File:Emperor Louis II before Bari.jpg|thumb|Louis II at the capture of Bari, 871, from Houze's ''Atlas Universel Historique et Geographique'' (1850)]]\n\nIn 852, the Saracens took [[Bari]] and founded an [[emirate]] there. Greek power being significantly threatened, as well as Adriatic commerce, the Byzantine emperor requested an alliance from Louis II of Italy. Similarly, the new prince of Benevento, [[Adelchis of Benevento|Adelchis]], an independent-minded ruler, also sought his aid. Louis came down and retook Bari in 871 after a great siege. Louis then tried to set up greater control over all the south by garrisoning his troops in Beneventan fortresses. The response of Adelchis to this action was to imprison and rob the emperor while he was staying the princely palace at Benevento. A month later, the Saracens had landed with a new invasive force and Adelchis released Louis to lead the armies against it. Adelchis forced Louis to vow never to re-enter Benevento with an army or to take revenge for his detention. Louis went to Rome in 872 and was released from his oath by [[Pope Adrian II]] on 28 May. His attempts to punish Adelchis were not very successful. Adelchis vacillated between nominal fealty to the Carolingian and Byzantine emperors, but, in fact, by his alterations to the [[Edictum Rothari]], he acknowledged himself as the legitimate Lombard \"king.\"\n\nThe successors of Adelchis were weak and the principality of Benevento declined just as Salernitan power was beginning to make itself felt. [[Guaifer of Salerno]] was on friendly terms with the Saracens, a habit which annoyed the popes and often put a ruler at odds with his neighbours. The south Italian lords continually rotating in their allegiances. Guaifer's successor, [[Guaimar I of Salerno|Guaimar I]], made war on the Saracens. Guaifer had originally associated Guaimar with him as co-ruler, a practice which became endemic to the south and was especially evident in Capua.\n\n==The Kingdom of Italy and the Holy Roman Empire==\n\n=== The Holy Roman Empire ===\n[[File:HRR 10Jh.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Holy Roman Empire]], 10th century]]\n\nIn 951 the thrones of Italy and Germany were united. The ruler of the new realm, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], claimed that the union revived the empire of [[Charlemagne]] and received the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 962. The Emperor, or his subordinate ruler of the [[Kingdom of Italy  (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]], nominally controlled the Northern Italian communes. The papacy went through an age of decadence, which ended only in 999 when emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] selected [[Pope Sylvester II|Silvester II]] as pope.\n\n=== Southern Italy ===\nUnder the [[Macedonian dynasty]], Byzantine power experienced a recovery; and the impact of this was felt in southern Italy.  During the late 9th century the amount of territory under direct Byzantine rule (which in the early 9th century was limited to the toe and heel of the peninsula) expanded dramatically. The [[Catepanate of Italy]] was set up to administer the newly acquired territory. The rest of Southern Italy remained divided among the Lombard kings and the Italian cities. Both sets of principalities were de facto independent, but paid nominal allegiance to Byzantium.\n\nThe Byzantine gains in the southern Italian mainland were, however, accompanied by setbacks in Sicily. In 878 the Arabs captured the crucial city of Syracuse, and by 902 the entire island was under Arab rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n===High Middle Ages (10th-13th Centuries)===\n\nThe 11th century signalled the end of the darkest period in the Middle Ages. Trade slowly picked up, especially on the seas, where the [[Maritime Republics]] of [[Amalfi]], [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], [[Ancona]] and [[Gaeta]] became major powers. The papacy regained its authority, and started a long struggle with the empire, about both ecclesiastical and secular matters. The first episode was the [[Investiture Controversy]]. In the 12th century those Italian cities which lay in the Holy Roman Empire launched a successful effort to win autonomy from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (see [[Lombard League]]); this made north Italy a land of quasi-independent or independent city-states until the 19th century (see [[Italian city-states]] and history of every city). The revolts were funded by Byzantium, which hoped to expel the Germans from Italy; this sponsorship was, like the invasion of the South, part of a 12th-century Byzantine effort to regain the influence it had held on the peninsula during the reign of Justinian.\n\nIn the 11th century, the [[Normans]] [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|occupied]] the Lombard and Byzantine possessions in Southern Italy, ending the six century old presence of both powers in the peninsula. The independent city-states were also subdued. During the same century, the Normans also ended Muslim rule in Sicily. Norman rule in what had once been Byzantine territory naturally angered Byzantium, which in 1155 made a last attempt under the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] to reassert its authority in Southern Italy. But the attempt failed, and in 1158 the Byzantines left Italy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\nUnlike the [[Norman conquest of England]] (1066), which took place over the course of a few years after one decisive battle, the conquest of Southern Italy was the product of decades and many battles, few decisive. Many territories were conquered independently, and only later were all unified into one state. Compared to the conquest of England, it was unplanned and unorganised, but just as permanent.\n\nIn 1194 [[Holy Roman Empire]] conquered [[Kingdom of Sicily]].\n\n==Late Middle Ages and Renaissance (14th century to 1559) ==\n{{further|Italian Renaissance|Italian Wars}}\n{{anchor|15th century}}\n[[File:Map of Italy in 1300 (simplified)-NL.svg|thumb|right|300px|Italy in 1328.]]\n\nIn the 14th century, Italy presents itself as divided between the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] in the south, the [[Papal States]] in Central Italy, and the [[Maritime republics]] in the north.\nThe [[Duchy of Milan]] found itself in the focus of European power politics in the 15th century, leading to the drawn-out [[Italian Wars]], which persisted for the best part of the 16th century before giving way to the [[History of Italy (1559\u20131814)|Early Modern period in Italy]].\n\nThe [[Black Plague]] ravaged Europe during the 1340s-50s, wiping out almost half the continent's population. Particularly detrimental was the fact that most of the victims were young adults in their prime working years, which left behind an \"hourglass\" population structure comprised heavily of children and older people with fewer in-between. The widespread belief of medieval Europe having a \"pyramid\" population where most people were under 45 was not completely true and in fact varied widely from region to region. France traditionally had high birth rates, but Italy's fertility was lower to begin with and especially after the Plague had ravaged the region, many cities such as [[Florence]], [[Verona]], and [[Arezzo]] had populations where more than 15% of people were over the age of 60. Since overall life expectancy in Europe did not increase by any significant margin during this period, the aging cohort in some areas can be almost completely blamed on the effects of the Plague. Wealthy households had larger numbers of children than the poor. For example, in the early 15th century, the average age of Florence's population among the lower classes was 25 while the upper classes had an average age of just 17. The countryside became swiftly depopulated after the Plague as well due to surviving young people moving en masse to the cities.\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] originates in 14th-century  [[Tuscany]], centered in the cities of [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. It later had a great impact in [[Venice]], where the remains of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] were brought together, providing [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars with new texts. The Renaissance later had a significant effect on [[Rome]], which was ornamented with some structures in the new ''all'antico'' mode, then was largely rebuilt by humanist 16th-century [[pope]]s.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]]. However, the ideas and ideals of the Renaissance endured and even spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]], and the [[English Renaissance]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Giudicati]]\n* [[Medieval Corsica]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cristina La Rocca (Ed.): ''Italy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-1000 (Short Oxford History of Italy)'', Oxford 2002.\n* Ruggiero, Guido.

Lombard rule ended with the invasion of [[Charlemagne]] in 773, who established the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Papal States]]. This set the precedent for the main political conflict in Italy over the following centuries, between the [[Pope]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], culminating with conflict between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and the latter's \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" in 1077.\n\nThe term \"Middle Ages\" itself ultimately derives from the description of the period of \"obscurity\" in Italian history during the 9th to 11th centuries, the [[saeculum obscurum]] or \"Dark Age\" of the Roman papacy<ref>[[Will Durant]] refers to the period from 867 to 1049 as the \"nadir of the papacy\"</ref> as seen from the perspective of the 14th to 15th century [[Renaissance Humanism|Italian Humanists]].\n\nIn the 11th century began a political development unique to Italy, the transformation of [[medieval commune]]s into powerful [[Italian city-states|city states]] modelled on ancient [[Roman Republic]]anism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\nThe republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], among others, rose to great political power and paved the way for the [[Italian Renaissance]] and ultimately the \"[[European miracle]]\", the resurgence of [[Western civilization]] from comparative obscurity in the [[Early Modern period]]. On the other hand, the Italian city states were in a state of constant warfare, adding to and overlapping with the persistent conflict between the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. \nEach city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, [[Guelf]]s (loyal to the Pope) and [[Ghibelline]]s (loyal to the Emperor). Since the 13th century, these wars had increasingly been fought by [[mercenaries]], giving rise to the Italian institution of ''[[condottiere|condottieri]]'' and the [[Swiss mercenary]] culture.\nAfter the three decades of [[wars in Lombardy]] between the [[Duchy of Milan]] and the Republic of Venice, there was eventually a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] between five emerging powerful states, which at the [[Peace of Lodi]] formed the  so-called [[Italic League]], bringing relative calm for the region for the first time in centuries. \nThese five powers were the [[Republic of Venice|maritime republic of Venice]] and [[Republic of Florence]], whose naval powers dominated the east and west coast of the peninsula, respectively, the territorial powers of Milan and the Papal States, dominating the northern and central parts of Italy, respectively, and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] in the south.\n\nThe precarious balance between these powers came to an end in 1494 as the duke of Milan [[Ludovico Sforza]] sought the aid of [[Charles VIII of France]] against Venice, triggering the [[Italian War of 1494\u201398]]. As a result, Italy became a battleground of the great European powers for the next sixty years, finally culminating in the [[Italian War of 1551\u201359]], which concluded with [[Habsburg Spain]] as the dominant power in Italy. The [[House of Habsburg]] would control Italy for the duration of the [[History of Italy (1559\u20131814)|early modern period]], until [[Napoleon]]'s [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|invasion of Italy]] in 1796.\n\n== Transition from Late Antiquity (6th to 8th centuries) ==\n{{further|Late Antiquity|Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom of the Lombards|Military history of Italy}}\n[[File:Odoacer Kingdom.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of Odoacer's Kingdom]]\nItaly was invaded by the [[Visigoths]] in the 5th century, and Rome was sacked by [[Alaric I|Alaric]] in 410. The (traditional) last Western [[Roman Emperor]], [[Romulus Augustus]], was deposed in 476 by an Eastern Germanic general, [[Odoacer]]. He subsequently ruled in Italy for seventeen years as ''rex gentium'', theoretically under the suzerainty of the eastern Roman emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], but practically in total independence. The administration remained essentially the same as that under the Western Roman Empire, and gave religious freedoms to the Christians. Odoacer fought against the Vandals, who had occupied [[Sicily]], and other Germanic tribes that periodically invaded the peninsula.\n\nIn 489, however, Emperor Zeno decided to oust the [[Ostrogoths]], a ''foederatum'' people living in the Danube, by sending them into Italy. On February 25, 493 [[Theodoric the Great]] defeated Odoacer and became the king of the Ostrogoths. Theodoric, who had lived long in Constantinople, is now generally considered a Romanized German, and he in fact ruled over Italy largely through Roman personnel. The Goth minority, of [[Arianism|Arian]] confession, constituted an aristocracy of landowners and militaries, but its influence over the country remained minimal; the Latin population was still subject to Roman laws, and maintained the freedom of creed received by Odoacer. The reign of Theodoric is generally considered a period of recovery for the country. Infrastructures were repaired, frontiers were expanded, and the economy well cared for. The Latin culture flourished for the last time with figures like [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], Theodoric's minister; the Italian Kingdom was again the most powerful political entity of the Mediterranean. However, Theodoric's successors were not equal to him.\n[[File:Empire of Theodoric the Great 523.gif|thumb|300px|right|The maximum extent of territories ruled by [[Theodoric the Great]] in 523.]]\nThe [[Byzantine Empire|eastern half of the Empire]], now centred on [[Constantinople]], invaded Italy in the early 6th century, and the generals of emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], [[Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], conquered the Ostrogothic kingdom after years of warfare, ending in 552. This conflict, known as the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic Wars]], destroyed much of the town life that had survived the barbarian invasions. Town life did not disappear, but they became smaller and considerably more primitive than they had been in Roman times. Subsistence agriculture employed the bulk of the Italian population. Wars, famines, and disease epidemics had a dramatic effect on the demographics of Italy.\nThe agricultural estates of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era did not disappear. They produced an agricultural surplus that was sold in towns; however slavery was replaced by other labour systems such as [[serfdom]].\n\nThe withdrawal of Byzantine armies allowed another Germanic people, the [[Lombards]], to invade Italy. [[Cividale del Friuli]] was the first main centre to fall, while the Byzantine resistance concentrated in the coast areas. The Lombards soon overran most of the peninsula, establishing a Kingdom with capital in [[Pavia]], divided into a series of dukedoms. The areas in central-northern Italy which remained under Byzantine control (mostly the current Lazio and [[Romagna]], plus a short corridor between Umbria that connected them, as well as [[Liguria]]) became the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. Southern Italy, with the exception of [[Apulia]], current [[Calabria]] and Sicily, were also occupied by the two semi-independent Lombard duchies of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]]. Under the Imperial authority remained also much of the ports, which eventually turned into actually independent city-states ([[Gaeta]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]], [[Amalfi]]).\n\n=== Rise of the Patriarchate of Rome ===\n[[File:Aistulf's Italy-it.svg|thumb|250px|left| Lombards domains after the conquests of [[Aistulf]] (751)]]\nThe Church (and especially the [[bishop]] of [[Rome]], by now styled the [[pope]]), had played an important political role since the time of Constantine, who tried to include it in the imperial administration.\n\nIn the politically unstable situation after the fall of the western empire, the Church often became the only stable institution and the only source of learning in western Europe. Even the barbarians had to rely on clerics in order to administer their conquests. Furthermore, the Catholic [[monasticism|monastic orders]], such as the [[Benedictine]]s had a major role both in the economic life of the time, and in the preservation of [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[culture]] (although in the east the Greek authors were much better preserved).\n\nAfter the Lombard invasion, the popes  were nominally subject to the eastern emperor, but often received little help from Constantinople, and had to fill the lack of stately power, providing essential services (ex. food for the needy) and protecting Rome from Lombard incursions; in this way, the popes started building an independent state.\n\n==Early Middle Ages (8th to 9th centuries)==\n{{further|Kingdom of Italy (medieval)}}\n\n=== Collapse of the Exarchate ===\nAt the end of the 8th century the popes definitely aspired to independence, and found a way to achieve it by allying with the [[Carolingian dynasty]] of the Franks: the Carolingians needed someone who could give legitimacy to a coup against the powerless [[Merovingian]] kings, while the popes needed military protection against the [[Lombards]].\n\nIn 751 the Lombards seized Ravenna and the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] was abolished. This ended the Byzantine presence in central Italy (although some coastal cities and some areas in south Italy remained under Byzantine control until the 11th century). Facing a new Lombard offensive, the papacy appealed to the [[Franks]] for aid. In 756 Frankish forces defeated the Lombards and gave the Papacy legal authority over all of central Italy, thus creating the [[Papal States]]. However, the remainder of Italy stayed under Lombard (such as Benevento and Spoleto) or Byzantine (such as Calabria, Apulia and Sicily) control.\n\n===The Frankish (Carolingian) Empire===\n[[File:Empire carolingien 768-811.jpg|thumb|300px|Expansion of the [[Frankish Empire]]:<br>Blue = realm of [[Pippin III]] in 758,<br>Orange = expansion under [[Charlemagne]] until 814,<br>Yellow = [[marches]] and dependencies]]\nIn 774, upon a Papal invitation, the Franks invaded the Kingdom of Italy and finally annexed the Lombards; as a reward the Frankish king [[Charlemagne]] received papal support. Later, on December 25, 800, Charlemagne was also crowned emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by the pope, triggering controversy and disputes over the [[Names of the Greeks|Roman name]]. A war between the two empires soon followed; in 812 the Byzantines agreed to recognize the existence of two Roman Empires in return for an assurance that the remaining Byzantine possessions in Italy would be uncontested.\n\nThroughout this period, some coastal regions, and all of southern Italy, remained under Byzantine or Lombard control. The Imperial authority never extended much south of the [[Italian Peninsula]]. Southern Italy was divided amongst the two Lombards duchies of [[Spoleto]] and [[Benevento]], who accepted Charlemagne's suzerainty only formally (812), and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Coastal cities like [[Gaeta]], [[Amalfi]], [[Naples]] on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], and [[Venice]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]], were Latin-Greek enclaves who were becoming increasingly independent from Byzantium. A conquest of Benevento, otherwise, would have meant the total encompassment of the Papal territories, and probably Charlemagne thought it was good for his relationships with the Pope to avoid such a move.  The age of Charlemagne was  one of stability for Italy, though it was generally dominated by non-Italian interests. The separation with the Eastern world continued to increase. [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]] was the first Pope to date his Bulls from the year of Charlemagne's reign (795) instead of those of Byzantine emperors. This process of isolation from the Eastern Empire and connection with the Western world of France and Germany, which had started three centuries before, was completed at the beginning of the 9th centuries. Sicily, Calabria, Puglia and the marine cities were the main exceptions to this rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nAfter the death of Charlemagne (814) the new empire soon disintegrated under his weak successors. The equilibrium created through the great emperor's charisma fell apart. This crisis was due also to the emergence of external forces, including the [[Saracen]] attacks and the rising power of the marine republics. Charlemagne had announced his division of the Empire in 806: the Lombard-Frank reign, together with [[Bavaria]] and [[Alamannia]], was to be handed over to his son [[Pepin of Italy]].\n\nAfter Charlemagne's son [[Louis the Pious]] died in 840, the [[treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the empire. Louis' eldest surviving son [[Lothair I]] became Emperor and ruler of the Central Franks. His three sons in turn divided this kingdom between them, and Northern Italy became the Kingdom of Italy under [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 839.\n\nThe first half of the 9th century saw other troubles for Italy as well. In 827, [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s known as [[Aghlabid]]s invaded and conquered [[Sicily]]; their descendants, the [[Kalbids]], ruled the island until 1053. In 846, Muslim Arabs invaded [[Rome]], looted [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and stole all the gold and silver in it. In response, [[Pope Leo IV]] started building the [[Leonine City|Leonine walls]] of the [[Vatican City]] in 847; they were completed in 853. In the late 9th century, the Byzantines and the Franks launched a joint offensive against the Arabs in southern Italy; however, only the Byzantines won any territory in that campaign.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n=== Southern Italy ===\n{{further|Duchy of Benevento|History of Islam in southern Italy|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}\n\nWith Charlemagne's conquest of 774, the north of Italy was politically separated from the south completely. Though the Byzantines had continued to hold most of Apulia and Calabria and the Lombard duchies of the south had been aloof of Pavian policies for a century, the situation was exacerbated by the loss of a centralising Lombard authority in the north. Immediately, the duke of Benevento, [[Arechis II of Benevento|Arechis II]], proclaimed himself a sovereign prince and set about opposing Charlemagne's assumption of Lombard kingship.\n\n==== Creation of independent moieties (774\u2013849) ====\nUnder Arechis and his successors, it was the Beneventan policy to pay homage to the Carolingian emperors but ignore their rulings. As a result, ''De facto'' independence was achieved from Frankish as well as Byzantine authority. The [[Duchy of Benevento]] reached its territorial peak under [[Sicard of Benevento|Sicard]] in the 830s. At his time, the Mezzogiorno was suffering the ravages of the [[Saracen]]s, against whom Sicard warred constantly. He also warred against his Greek neighbours, especially [[Duchy of Sorrento|Sorrento]], [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]. It was in a war with Naples that [[Andrew II of Naples|Duke Andrew II]] first called in [[Saracen]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]].\n\nIn 839, Sicard was assassinated and a civil war broke out which illustrated the nature of political power in the south. It was still largely in the hands of the land-owning aristocracy, who had the power to choose a prince. In 839, some chose [[Radelchis I of Benevento|Radelchis I]], the treasurer and assassin, and some chose [[Siconulf of Salerno]], who was installed at [[Salerno]]. This civil war continued apace for a decade, during which the [[Gastald|gastaldates]] of Benevento took the opportunity to entrench their independence, especially [[Principality of Capua|Capua]], which sided with Siconulf. In 849, the [[Louis II of Italy|Emperor Louis II]], in one of his first acts as [[List of Italian monarchs|King of Italy]], invaded the peninsula and imposed peace between the Lombard factions. He divided the principality into two: one at Benevento, one at Salerno. Thenceforward, the history of the Lombard south is one of declining, competing powers.\n\n[[File:ItriCastello3.jpg|thumb|Castle of [[Itri]], probably dating from Docibilis I's reign.]]\n\nIn the [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] Greek cities, the violence raging inland, between them and their fellow Greeks on toe and heel, fostered the circumstances of ''de facto'' independence. Naples, in particular, had a history of differences with Byzantium and had in the past sought to make herself dependent on other authorities, often papal. In 801, the Byzantine [[patricianship|patrician]] of Sicily succeeded in creating [[Anthimus of Naples|Anthimus]] duke. However, Anthimus was unable to control the cities under his rule, Gaeta and Amalfi. Subsequent to Anthimus, the patrician tried to appoint his own candidate without imperial approval. The people rebelled and accepted [[Stephen III of Naples|Stephen III]] in 821. During Stephen's decade of rule, Naples severed all legal ties to Constantinople and even began minting her own coins. In 840, after a brief flirtation with Frankish servitude, to [[Lothair I]], and a Frankish duke, in the person of [[Contardus of Naples|Duke Contard]], the Neapolitan citizenry elected [[Sergius I of Naples|Sergius I]] their ''[[magister militum]]''. Sergius established a dynasty, the [[Serge (first name)|Sergi]], that was to rule the duchy for the next three hundred years.\n\nIn Gaeta, as in Naples, the violent situation inland required new power structures to maintain Byzantine authority. The Gaetans received their first imperial Byzantine ''[[hypatus|hypati]]'' around the time of the Beneventan civil war. While the first ''hypati'' remained Byzantine loyals, in 866, the sudden appearance of a new dynasty under [[Docibilis I of Gaeta|Docibilis I]] represented Gaeta's move from Byzantium towards independence. The first elected [[List of Dukes of Amalfi|ruler of Amalfi]] was a ''[[prefect]]'' appearing in 839, simultaneous with the death of Sicard and the appearance of a Gaetan ''hyaptus''. However, Naples, Gaeta, Amalfi, the Tyrrhenian cities, and Venice (in North Italy) retained some allegiance to Byzantium until the 11th century-long after becoming ''de facto'' independent.\n\n==== Period of confusion (849\u2013915) ====\nThe period following the Beneventan civil war was one of confusion, brought on by the independence movements in the various cities and provinces and by the Saracen onslaught. In Salerno, a palace coup removed Siconulf's successor [[Sico of Salerno|Sico II]] in 853 and destabilised that principality until a new dynasty, the Dauferidi, came to power in 861.\n\n[[File:Emperor Louis II before Bari.jpg|thumb|Louis II at the capture of Bari, 871, from Houze's ''Atlas Universel Historique et Geographique'' (1850)]]\n\nIn 852, the Saracens took [[Bari]] and founded an [[emirate]] there. Greek power being significantly threatened, as well as Adriatic commerce, the Byzantine emperor requested an alliance from Louis II of Italy. Similarly, the new prince of Benevento, [[Adelchis of Benevento|Adelchis]], an independent-minded ruler, also sought his aid. Louis came down and retook Bari in 871 after a great siege. Louis then tried to set up greater control over all the south by garrisoning his troops in Beneventan fortresses. The response of Adelchis to this action was to imprison and rob the emperor while he was staying the princely palace at Benevento. A month later, the Saracens had landed with a new invasive force and Adelchis released Louis to lead the armies against it. Adelchis forced Louis to vow never to re-enter Benevento with an army or to take revenge for his detention. Louis went to Rome in 872 and was released from his oath by [[Pope Adrian II]] on 28 May. His attempts to punish Adelchis were not very successful. Adelchis vacillated between nominal fealty to the Carolingian and Byzantine emperors, but, in fact, by his alterations to the [[Edictum Rothari]], he acknowledged himself as the legitimate Lombard \"king.\"\n\nThe successors of Adelchis were weak and the principality of Benevento declined just as Salernitan power was beginning to make itself felt. [[Guaifer of Salerno]] was on friendly terms with the Saracens, a habit which annoyed the popes and often put a ruler at odds with his neighbours. The south Italian lords continually rotating in their allegiances. Guaifer's successor, [[Guaimar I of Salerno|Guaimar I]], made war on the Saracens. Guaifer had originally associated Guaimar with him as co-ruler, a practice which became endemic to the south and was especially evident in Capua.\n\n==The Kingdom of Italy and the Holy Roman Empire==\n\n=== The Holy Roman Empire ===\n[[File:HRR 10Jh.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Holy Roman Empire]], 10th century]]\n\nIn 951 the thrones of Italy and Germany were united. The ruler of the new realm, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], claimed that the union revived the empire of [[Charlemagne]] and received the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 962. The Emperor, or his subordinate ruler of the [[Kingdom of Italy  (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]], nominally controlled the Northern Italian communes. The papacy went through an age of decadence, which ended only in 999 when emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] selected [[Pope Sylvester II|Silvester II]] as pope.\n\n=== Southern Italy ===\nUnder the [[Macedonian dynasty]], Byzantine power experienced a recovery; and the impact of this was felt in southern Italy.  During the late 9th century the amount of territory under direct Byzantine rule (which in the early 9th century was limited to the toe and heel of the peninsula) expanded dramatically. The [[Catepanate of Italy]] was set up to administer the newly acquired territory. The rest of Southern Italy remained divided among the Lombard kings and the Italian cities. Both sets of principalities were de facto independent, but paid nominal allegiance to Byzantium.\n\nThe Byzantine gains in the southern Italian mainland were, however, accompanied by setbacks in Sicily. In 878 the Arabs captured the crucial city of Syracuse, and by 902 the entire island was under Arab rule.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n===High Middle Ages (10th-13th Centuries)===\n\nThe 11th century signalled the end of the darkest period in the Middle Ages. Trade slowly picked up, especially on the seas, where the [[Maritime Republics]] of [[Amalfi]], [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], [[Ancona]] and [[Gaeta]] became major powers. The papacy regained its authority, and started a long struggle with the empire, about both ecclesiastical and secular matters. The first episode was the [[Investiture Controversy]]. In the 12th century those Italian cities which lay in the Holy Roman Empire launched a successful effort to win autonomy from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (see [[Lombard League]]); this made north Italy a land of quasi-independent or independent city-states until the 19th century (see [[Italian city-states]] and history of every city). The revolts were funded by Byzantium, which hoped to expel the Germans from Italy; this sponsorship was, like the invasion of the South, part of a 12th-century Byzantine effort to regain the influence it had held on the peninsula during the reign of Justinian.\n\nIn the 11th century, the [[Normans]] [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|occupied]] the Lombard and Byzantine possessions in Southern Italy, ending the six century old presence of both powers in the peninsula. The independent city-states were also subdued. During the same century, the Normans also ended Muslim rule in Sicily. Norman rule in what had once been Byzantine territory naturally angered Byzantium, which in 1155 made a last attempt under the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] to reassert its authority in Southern Italy. But the attempt failed, and in 1158 the Byzantines left Italy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\nUnlike the [[Norman conquest of England]] (1066), which took place over the course of a few years after one decisive battle, the conquest of Southern Italy was the product of decades and many battles, few decisive. Many territories were conquered independently, and only later were all unified into one state. Compared to the conquest of England, it was unplanned and unorganised, but just as permanent.\n\nIn 1194 [[Holy Roman Empire]] conquered [[Kingdom of Sicily]].\n\n==Late Middle Ages and Renaissance (14th century to 1559) ==\n{{further|Italian Renaissance|Italian Wars}}\n{{anchor|15th century}}\n[[File:Map of Italy in 1300 (simplified)-NL.svg|thumb|right|300px|Italy in 1328.]]\n\nIn the 14th century, Italy presents itself as divided between the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] in the south, the [[Papal States]] in Central Italy, and the [[Maritime republics]] in the north.\nThe [[Duchy of Milan]] found itself in the focus of European power politics in the 15th century, leading to the drawn-out [[Italian Wars]], which persisted for the best part of the 16th century before giving way to the [[History of Italy (1559\u20131814)|Early Modern period in Italy]].\n\nThe [[Black Plague]] ravaged Europe during the 1340s-50s, wiping out almost half the continent's population. Particularly detrimental was the fact that most of the victims were young adults in their prime working years, which left behind an \"hourglass\" population structure comprised heavily of children and older people with fewer in-between. The widespread belief of medieval Europe having a \"pyramid\" population where most people were under 45 was not completely true and in fact varied widely from region to region. France traditionally had high birth rates, but Italy's fertility was lower to begin with and especially after the Plague had ravaged the region, many cities such as [[Florence]], [[Verona]], and [[Arezzo]] had populations where more than 15% of people were over the age of 60. Since overall life expectancy in Europe did not increase by any significant margin during this period, the aging cohort in some areas can be almost completely blamed on the effects of the Plague. Wealthy households had larger numbers of children than the poor. For example, in the early 15th century, the average age of Florence's population among the lower classes was 25 while the upper classes had an average age of just 17. The countryside became swiftly depopulated after the Plague as well due to surviving young people moving en masse to the cities.\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] originates in 14th-century  [[Tuscany]], centered in the cities of [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. It later had a great impact in [[Venice]], where the remains of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] were brought together, providing [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars with new texts. The Renaissance later had a significant effect on [[Rome]], which was ornamented with some structures in the new ''all'antico'' mode, then was largely rebuilt by humanist 16th-century [[pope]]s.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]]. However, the ideas and ideals of the Renaissance endured and even spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]], and the [[English Renaissance]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Giudicati]]\n* [[Medieval Corsica]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cristina La Rocca (Ed.): ''Italy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-1000 (Short Oxford History of Italy)'', Oxford 2002.\n* Ruggiero, Guido.

Developed during the 1960s, blue boxes allowed private individuals to control long-distance call routing and to bypass the toll-collection mechanisms of telephone companies,<ref name=\"sterling\">{{cite book |title=The Hacker Crackdown |first=Bruce |last=Sterling |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |chapter=2 |title-link=The Hacker Crackdown }}</ref> enabling the user to place free long-distance telephone calls on national and international circuits.\n\nAt first the use of these techniques was limited to a small group of \"[[phreaker]]s\", which included, among others, [[Steve Wozniak]]. After the publication of \"Secrets of the Blue Box\" in October 1971's edition of [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]], interest in the topic grew tremendously, both among end-users as well as the Bell System. The practice was ruled as telephone fraud by the Bell System and the courts, and prosecuted vigorously.\n\nBlue boxes worked because the telephone system used tones in the existing voice lines to send routing instructions, and these tones were not filtered out at the handsets. Subsequent telephone switching technologies used [[out-of-band signaling]] methods in the form of [[Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]] (CCIS) in a separate channel not accessible to the caller. Blue boxing stopped working as these systems were deployed.\n\nA related device, dubbed [[Black box (phreaking)|black box]], enabled reception of calls without incurring a charge to the caller. \n\n== History ==\n{{Listen|filename=2600 Hz.ogg|title=2600 Hz|description=('''LOUD''') A tone of 2600&nbsp;Hz|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{Listen\n|filename=Mf-tones-1.ogg\n|title=Multi-frequency dialing\n|description=These multi-frequency tones were generated by automated switching equipment.

The designers were aware that the in-band signaling method was subject to false signals arising in the telephone handset from ambient sounds, and chose the frequency of 2600&nbsp;Hz because it was not present in normal speech. This choice performed well in the normal use of telephones. It was not foreseen, that a telephone user could insert control signals into the switching system by sending the appropriate tones into the telephone handset.\n\nBefore the technical details were published, many users discovered unintentionally and to their annoyance that a 2600 [[Hertz|Hz]] tone, used as a steady [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] to mark currently unused [[Long distance calling|long-distance]] [[telephone line]]s, or \"[[trunk line]]s\", would reset those lines.

Two major amateur radio magazines ('73' and \"CQ') published articles on the telephone system in the mid-1970s.

Software was made to facilitate blue boxing using a computer to generate the signalling tones and play them into the phone. For the PC there were [[BlueBEEP]], TLO, and others, and blue boxes for other platforms such as [[Amiga]] were available as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Theory==\nLocal [[plain old telephone service]] works by watching the voltage on the telephone lines between the telephone company's [[telephone exchange|exchange office]] and the customer's telephone. When the phone is on-hook (\"hung up\") the approximately 48&nbsp;[[volt]] electricity from the exchange flows to the phone and is looped back without passing through the handset. When the user picks up the handset, the current has to flow through the speaker and microphone in it, causing the voltage to drop to under 10&nbsp;V. This sudden drop in voltage signals the user has picked up the phone. This system works well for short-distance lines on the order of a few kilometers, but as the distance grows the [[capacitance]] of the wires begins to filter out the sharp changes in voltage. So while the system is fine for local connections to the exchange, it is not useful for watching the status of lines on long-distance connections between exchanges. \n\nTo address this need, the Bell System adopted a second system on the circuits that connected the exchanges together. These lines were switched by a system known as a [[Class-4 telephone switch|\"tandem\"]], which the local exchange would switch to when it recognized the number was not local, typically by dialing a \"1\" at the beginning of the number. The tandem included the routing systems and long-distance trunk lines needed to talk to tandems at other exchanges, thereby linking the exchanges together. The tandems also faced the problem that the DC signals did not work over long distances, so instead, they used tones played into the lines to indicate status and dial numbers.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nThe basic protocol worked by playing a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone into the line whenever it was not being used. The tandems at both ends of a given trunk line did this. When a system received a call being routed to a remote system, it scanned the trunk lines between the two tandems looking for the tone. When it heard the tone on one of the lines, it knew it was free to use. They would then select that line and drop the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone from their end. The remote tandem would hear the tone stop, drop their own tone, and then play a ''supervision flash'', making a \"ka-cheep\" sound, to indicate they had noticed the signal. The line was now free on both ends to place a call.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nDialing a POTS phone used the same voltage-drop system to indicate digits by rapidly cycling the hook, nine times to dial the digit 9 for instance. This was known as [[pulse dialing]]. As it also required rapid voltage changes, it too did not work over long-distance links. This is why long-distance calling required operator assistance well into the 20th century, long after local calling had been completely automated.\n\nTo address this problem and allow end-to-end user long-distance dialing, Bell introduced a second system that encoded digits as two tones, the [[multi-frequency signaling]] system, or \"MF\". Before the widespread use of end-user phones with touchpad dialing, the tone dialer was located in the tandem. When the user placed a long-distance call, the initial \"1\" connected the customer's line to the tandem, which then read the following digits, notably the area code, to find the target exchange. Once it had the target it scanned the trunk lines to that exchange looking for a free line, connected to it, and then relayed the rest of the phone number over the line using the tone dialing method. The remote tandem then decoded the tones and turned them back into pulses on the local exchange.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nWhen the call was complete and one of the parties hung up the phone, that end of the connection would indicate this by playing the 2600 Hz tone again. The other end of the connection would hear the tone and cause their local call to hang up as well.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\n== Operation ==\nThe operation of a blue box was simple: First, the user placed a [[long distance telephone call]], often to a number that was in the target area. Usually this initial call would be to a toll-free number or some other non-supervising telephone number.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}} Using a toll-free number ensured that the phone being used for access would not be billed.\n\nWhen the call began to ring, the caller would use the blue box to send a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone (or 2600+2400&nbsp;Hz on many international trunks followed by a 2400&nbsp;Hz tone). Hearing this tone, the remote office believes the user hung up, and disconnects the call on their exchange and begins playing 2600 to mark the line free. However, this does not disconnect the call locally, only physically hanging up the phone will do that. So, in this case, the user is left on a live line, one that is connected via a long-distance trunk line to a target exchange.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nThe user now stops playing the tone. The remote exchange interprets this loss of tone to mean the exchange's tandem is attempting to place another call. It responds by dropping its tone and then playing the flash to indicate it is ready to accept routing tones. Once the far end sends the supervision flash, the user uses the blue box to send a \"Key Pulse\" or \"KP\", the tone that starts a routing digit sequence, followed by either a telephone number or one of the numerous special codes that were used internally by the telephone company, then finished with an \"Start\" tone, \"ST\".{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}} At this point, the far end of the connection would route the call the way it was told, while the user's local exchange would presume the call was still ringing at the original number. There were two KP tones, KP1 would generally be used for domestic dialing, and KP2 for international calls.\n\nThe blue box consisted of a set of [[audio oscillators]], a [[telephone keypad]], an [[audio amplifier]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]]. Its use relied, like much of the [[telephone hacking]] methods of the time, on the use of a constant tone of 2600&nbsp;Hz to indicate an unused [[telephone line]]. A free long-distance telephone call (such as a [[toll-free telephone number|1-800]] number or, less commonly, the [[Directory assistance|information operator]] from another [[area code]]) was made using a regular telephone, and when the line was connected, a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone from the blue box was fed into the mouthpiece of the telephone, causing the operator to be disconnected and a free long-distance line to be available to the blue box user. The keyboard was then used to place the desired call, using [[Multi-frequency signaling|multi-frequency tones]] specific for [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. These frequencies are different from the normal [[touch tone frequencies]] used by telephone subscribers, which is why the telephone keypad could not be used and the blue box was necessary.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nThe ultimate \"solution\" to the blue box was already being developed when phreaking first became popular in the early 1970s, as [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] was prototyping the [[No. 4 Electronic Switching System]] (4ESS). This system (and similar ones) handled all call routing in a computer, sending routing instructions over separate dedicated data-only lines. This offered far better utilization of the expensive long-distance trunk lines.\n\nFor instance, if a local caller placed a call to a remote number using the tandem system, the call would have to be placed all the way to the remote number via the voice lines. If that customer was busy, the user had to listen for the [[busy signal]] and then hang up. This process required the trunk line to be connected for many seconds. Using electronic signaling, the connection request was routed over data lines, which could immediately send back a \"line busy\" response. This did not require the trunk line to be used at all. Although this might save only a few seconds, with millions of such calls being placed every day, the advantages quickly added up.\n\nAt the time, phreakers felt there was nothing [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] could do to stop blue boxing because it would require Bell to upgrade all their hardware.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}} That was precisely what Bell was already planning to do, but as the network already included large numbers of existing switches that were susceptible to blue boxing, the switchover would take some time.\n\nFor the immediate term, Bell responded with a number of countermeasures. As existing [[electronic switching system]]s maintained logs of all calls made, including calls to [[toll-free telephone number]]s, Bell began examining the logs looking for suspicious patterns of activity. For instance, lengthy repeated calls to information or national hotel reservation numbers might indicate the presence of a phreaker using a particular line. In this case, filters could be installed on those lines to block the blue box. Bell also would wiretap the affected lines. In one 1975 case, the [[Pacific Bell|Pacific Telephone Company]] targeted one defendant's line with the following equipment:\n* A CMC 2600, a device which registers on a counter the number of times a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone is detected on the line;\n* A tape recorder, activated automatically by the CMC 2600 to record two minutes of telephone audio after each burst of 2600&nbsp;Hz activity; and\n* A Hekemian 51A, which replicates the functions of the CMC 2600 and also produces a paper tape print-out of outgoing calls. Ordinary calls were recorded in black ink and destination numbers called via the blue box were recorded in red ink.<ref>[https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/563/563.F2d.967.76-3391.html UNITED STATES of America vs. Bernard CORNFELD, dba Grayhall Inc], No. 76-3391, United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. Oct. 27, 1977.</ref>\n\n== Demise and legacy ==\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, some legacy trunks were modified to filter out [[Single-frequency signaling|single frequency tones]] arriving from a caller. \n\nThe development of digital switching equipment and [[out-of-band signaling]] systems with separate bearer and signaling channels (such as [[Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]] and [[Signaling System 7]]) prevented the use of blue boxes. The \"blue box\" terminology has since been [[blue box recycling system|recycled for other purposes]]. The hacking community evolved into other endeavors{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} and there currently exists a commercially published hacking magazine, titled ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly|2600]]'', a reference to the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone that was once central to so much of telephone hacking.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.2600.com/wall/24-05-2016 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602035336/http://www.2600.com/wall/24-05-2016 |archive-date=2016-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Frequencies and timings ==\nEach multifrequency tone consists of two frequencies chosen from a set of six, shown in the table on the left.

The 'KP' and 'KP2' tones are sent for 100ms. KP2 (ST2 in the [[R1 standard]]) was used for dialing internal Bell System telephone numbers. However, actual frequency durations can vary depending on location, switch type, and the machine status.\n\nThis set of MF tones was originally devised for [[Bell System]] [[switchboard operator|long-distance operators]] placing calls manually, and predates the DTMF ''Touch-Tone'' system used by subscribers.

As some NPAs contained multiple cities, an additional routing code was sometimes placed after the area code. For instance, [[area code 519|519]]+044+121 may reach the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] inward operator and 519+034+121 the [[London, Ontario|London]] inward operator {{convert|175|km|abbr=on}} distant, but in the same area code.<ref>[http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs/trg/TRG-1977-Sec10-Part16-Canada.pdf Traffic Routing Guide], AT&T, 1977</ref>\n\n== Blue boxes in other countries ==\nAnother signaling system widely used on international circuits (except those terminating in North America) was [[CCITT]] Signaling System No. 4 (friendly named 'SS4').\n\nTechnical definitions are specified in formerly CCITT (now [[ITU-T]]) Recommendations Q.120 to Q.139.<ref>CCITT SS4 / ITU-T Q.120-139 https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-Q.120-Q.139-198811-I!!PDF-E&type=items</ref>\n\nThis was also an in-band system but, instead of using multifrequency signals for digits, it used four 35 ms pulses of tone, separated by 35 ms of silence, to represent digits in four-bit binary code, with 2400&nbsp;Hz as a '0' and 2040&nbsp;Hz as a '1'. The supervisory signals used the same two frequencies, but each supervisory signal started with both tones together (for 150 ms) followed, without a gap, by a long (350 ms) or short (100 ms) period of a single tone of 2400&nbsp;Hz or 2040&nbsp;Hz. Phreaks in Europe built System 4 blue boxes that generated these signals. Because System 4 was used only on international circuits, the use of these blue boxes was more specialized.\n\nTypically, a phreak would gain access to international dialing at low or zero cost by some other means, make a dialed call to a country that was available via direct dialing, and then use the System 4 blue box to clear down the international connection and make a call to a destination that was available only via operator service. Thus, the System 4 blue box was used primarily as a way of setting up calls to hard-to-reach operator-only destinations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA typical System 4 blue box had a keypad (for sending four-bit digit signals) plus four buttons for the four supervisory signals (clear-forward, seize-terminal, seize-transit, and transfer-to-operator). After some experimentation, nimble-fingered phreaks found that all they really needed was two buttons, one for each frequency. With practice, it was possible to manually generate all the signals with sufficient timing precision, including the digit signals. This made it possible to make the blue box quite small.\n\nA refinement added to some System 4 blue boxes was an anti-acknowledgement-echo guard tone. Because the connection between the telephone and the telephone network is two-wire, but the signalling on the international circuit operates on a four-wire basis (totally separate send and receive paths), signal-acknowledgement tones (single pulses of one of the two frequencies from the far end of the circuit after receipt of each digit) tended to be reflected back at the four-wire/two-wire conversion point. Although these reflected signals were relatively faint, they were sometimes loud enough for the digit-receiving circuits at the far end to treat them as the first bit of the next digit, messing up the phreak's transmitted digits.\n\nWhat the improved blue box did was to continuously transmit a tone of some other frequency (e.g., 600&nbsp;Hz) as a guard tone whenever it was not sending a System 4 signal. This guard tone drowned out the echoed acknowledgement signals, so that only the blue box-transmitted digits were heard by the digit-receiving circuits at the far end.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Falsing]]\n* [[Operation Cybersnare]] \u2013 Story involving Blue Boxing from the United States\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite magazine |magazine=Esquire |date=1 October 1971 |title=Secrets of the Little Blue Box |first=Ron |last=Rosenbaum |url=https://classic.esquire.com/article/1971/10/1/secrets-of-the-blue-box |ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.nerdnetworks.org/sarts/ The SARTS technical journal]\n* [http://myoldmac.net/FAQ/TheBlueBox-1.htm Secrets of the Little Blue Box \u2013 article with photos]\n* [http://www.artofhacking.com/tucops/phreak/boxes/blue/index.htm All about the Blue Box and related devices]\n* [http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/BLUEBOXING/ Text files about blue boxing]\n* [http://www.elfqrin.com/docs/hakref/phrkbox/phreakboxes.html The definitive guide to Phreak boxes]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121119114513/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/funwithdickandjane.pdf Fun with Dick and Jane by Lewis Gum and Edward Oxford \u2013 article that appeared in the 1978 Bell Telephone Magazine about telephone fraud and Phone Phreaks]\n* [http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/ A site dedicated to the history of phone phreaking, with extensive information on blue boxing.]\n* [http://www.projectmf.org/ A working, publicly accessible simulation of the old telephone network that allows legal blue boxing.

Developed during the 1960s, blue boxes allowed private individuals to control long-distance call routing and to bypass the toll-collection mechanisms of telephone companies,<ref name=\"sterling\">{{cite book |title=The Hacker Crackdown |first=Bruce |last=Sterling |authorlink=Bruce Sterling |chapter=2 |title-link=The Hacker Crackdown }}</ref> enabling the user to place free long-distance telephone calls on national and international circuits.\n\nAt first the use of these techniques was limited to a small group of \"[[phreaker]]s\", which included, among others, [[Steve Wozniak]]. After the publication of \"Secrets of the Blue Box\" in October 1971's edition of [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]], interest in the topic grew tremendously, both among end-users as well as the Bell System. The practice was ruled as telephone fraud by the Bell System and the courts, and prosecuted vigorously.\n\nBlue boxes worked because the telephone system used tones in the existing voice lines to send routing instructions, and these tones were not filtered out at the handsets. Subsequent telephone switching technologies used [[out-of-band signaling]] methods in the form of [[Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]] (CCIS) in a separate channel not accessible to the caller. Blue boxing stopped working as these systems were deployed.\n\nA related device, dubbed [[Black box (phreaking)|black box]], enabled reception of calls without incurring a charge to the caller. \n\n== History ==\n{{Listen|filename=2600 Hz.ogg|title=2600 Hz|description=('''LOUD''') A tone of 2600&nbsp;Hz|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n{{Listen\n|filename=Mf-tones-1.ogg\n|title=Multi-frequency dialing\n|description=These multi-frequency tones were generated by automated switching equipment.

The designers were aware that the in-band signaling method was subject to false signals arising in the telephone handset from ambient sounds, and chose the frequency of 2600&nbsp;Hz because it was not present in normal speech. This choice performed well in the normal use of telephones. It was not foreseen, that a telephone user could insert control signals into the switching system by sending the appropriate tones into the telephone handset.\n\nBefore the technical details were published, many users discovered unintentionally and to their annoyance that a 2600 [[Hertz|Hz]] tone, used as a steady [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] to mark currently unused [[Long distance calling|long-distance]] [[telephone line]]s, or \"[[trunk line]]s\", would reset those lines.

Two major amateur radio magazines ('73' and \"CQ') published articles on the telephone system in the mid-1970s. CQ Magazine published details on phone phreaking, including the tone frequencies and several working blue box schematics in 1974.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The June 1975 issue of '73' featured an article describing the rudiments of the long-distance signaling network, how to construct red and blue boxes, and put them into operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/73-magazine-1975-06|title=73 Magazine (June 1975)|date=1 June 1975|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2019|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Around the same time, do-it-yourself kits were available to build one's own blue box.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QeQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=expect+that+%22blue+box%22+bell#v=onepage&q=expect+that+%22blue+box%22+bell&f=false|title=New York Magazine|first=New York Media|last=LLC|date=June 6, 1977|publisher=New York Media, LLC|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o2hRAAAAMAAJ&q=blue+box+phone+phreaking+kits&dq=blue+box+phone+phreaking+kits|title=Technology in Postwar America: A History|first=Carroll W.|last=Pursell|date=December 6, 2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780231123044}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1988, the [[CCITT]] (now known as [[ITU-T]]) published recommendation Q.140 for the [[Signaling System No. 5]], which caused a resurgence of blue boxing incidents in a new generation of users.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nDuring the early 1990s, blue boxing became popular with the international [[warez scene]], especially in Europe. Software was made to facilitate blue boxing using a computer to generate the signalling tones and play them into the phone. For the PC there were [[BlueBEEP]], TLO, and others, and blue boxes for other platforms such as [[Amiga]] were available as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Theory==\nLocal [[plain old telephone service]] works by watching the voltage on the telephone lines between the telephone company's [[telephone exchange|exchange office]] and the customer's telephone. When the phone is on-hook (\"hung up\") the approximately 48&nbsp;[[volt]] electricity from the exchange flows to the phone and is looped back without passing through the handset. When the user picks up the handset, the current has to flow through the speaker and microphone in it, causing the voltage to drop to under 10&nbsp;V. This sudden drop in voltage signals the user has picked up the phone. This system works well for short-distance lines on the order of a few kilometers, but as the distance grows the [[capacitance]] of the wires begins to filter out the sharp changes in voltage. So while the system is fine for local connections to the exchange, it is not useful for watching the status of lines on long-distance connections between exchanges. \n\nTo address this need, the Bell System adopted a second system on the circuits that connected the exchanges together. These lines were switched by a system known as a [[Class-4 telephone switch|\"tandem\"]], which the local exchange would switch to when it recognized the number was not local, typically by dialing a \"1\" at the beginning of the number. The tandem included the routing systems and long-distance trunk lines needed to talk to tandems at other exchanges, thereby linking the exchanges together. The tandems also faced the problem that the DC signals did not work over long distances, so instead, they used tones played into the lines to indicate status and dial numbers.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nThe basic protocol worked by playing a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone into the line whenever it was not being used. The tandems at both ends of a given trunk line did this. When a system received a call being routed to a remote system, it scanned the trunk lines between the two tandems looking for the tone. When it heard the tone on one of the lines, it knew it was free to use. They would then select that line and drop the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone from their end. The remote tandem would hear the tone stop, drop their own tone, and then play a ''supervision flash'', making a \"ka-cheep\" sound, to indicate they had noticed the signal. The line was now free on both ends to place a call.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nDialing a POTS phone used the same voltage-drop system to indicate digits by rapidly cycling the hook, nine times to dial the digit 9 for instance. This was known as [[pulse dialing]]. As it also required rapid voltage changes, it too did not work over long-distance links. This is why long-distance calling required operator assistance well into the 20th century, long after local calling had been completely automated.\n\nTo address this problem and allow end-to-end user long-distance dialing, Bell introduced a second system that encoded digits as two tones, the [[multi-frequency signaling]] system, or \"MF\". Before the widespread use of end-user phones with touchpad dialing, the tone dialer was located in the tandem. When the user placed a long-distance call, the initial \"1\" connected the customer's line to the tandem, which then read the following digits, notably the area code, to find the target exchange. Once it had the target it scanned the trunk lines to that exchange looking for a free line, connected to it, and then relayed the rest of the phone number over the line using the tone dialing method. The remote tandem then decoded the tones and turned them back into pulses on the local exchange.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nWhen the call was complete and one of the parties hung up the phone, that end of the connection would indicate this by playing the 2600 Hz tone again. The other end of the connection would hear the tone and cause their local call to hang up as well.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\n== Operation ==\nThe operation of a blue box was simple: First, the user placed a [[long distance telephone call]], often to a number that was in the target area. Usually this initial call would be to a toll-free number or some other non-supervising telephone number.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}} Using a toll-free number ensured that the phone being used for access would not be billed.\n\nWhen the call began to ring, the caller would use the blue box to send a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone (or 2600+2400&nbsp;Hz on many international trunks followed by a 2400&nbsp;Hz tone). Hearing this tone, the remote office believes the user hung up, and disconnects the call on their exchange and begins playing 2600 to mark the line free. However, this does not disconnect the call locally, only physically hanging up the phone will do that. So, in this case, the user is left on a live line, one that is connected via a long-distance trunk line to a target exchange.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}}\n\nThe user now stops playing the tone. The remote exchange interprets this loss of tone to mean the exchange's tandem is attempting to place another call. It responds by dropping its tone and then playing the flash to indicate it is ready to accept routing tones. Once the far end sends the supervision flash, the user uses the blue box to send a \"Key Pulse\" or \"KP\", the tone that starts a routing digit sequence, followed by either a telephone number or one of the numerous special codes that were used internally by the telephone company, then finished with an \"Start\" tone, \"ST\".{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}} At this point, the far end of the connection would route the call the way it was told, while the user's local exchange would presume the call was still ringing at the original number. There were two KP tones, KP1 would generally be used for domestic dialing, and KP2 for international calls.\n\nThe blue box consisted of a set of [[audio oscillators]], a [[telephone keypad]], an [[audio amplifier]] and [[Loudspeaker|speaker]]. Its use relied, like much of the [[telephone hacking]] methods of the time, on the use of a constant tone of 2600&nbsp;Hz to indicate an unused [[telephone line]]. A free long-distance telephone call (such as a [[toll-free telephone number|1-800]] number or, less commonly, the [[Directory assistance|information operator]] from another [[area code]]) was made using a regular telephone, and when the line was connected, a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone from the blue box was fed into the mouthpiece of the telephone, causing the operator to be disconnected and a free long-distance line to be available to the blue box user. The keyboard was then used to place the desired call, using [[Multi-frequency signaling|multi-frequency tones]] specific for [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. These frequencies are different from the normal [[touch tone frequencies]] used by telephone subscribers, which is why the telephone keypad could not be used and the blue box was necessary.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nThe ultimate \"solution\" to the blue box was already being developed when phreaking first became popular in the early 1970s, as [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] was prototyping the [[No. 4 Electronic Switching System]] (4ESS). This system (and similar ones) handled all call routing in a computer, sending routing instructions over separate dedicated data-only lines. This offered far better utilization of the expensive long-distance trunk lines.\n\nFor instance, if a local caller placed a call to a remote number using the tandem system, the call would have to be placed all the way to the remote number via the voice lines. If that customer was busy, the user had to listen for the [[busy signal]] and then hang up. This process required the trunk line to be connected for many seconds. Using electronic signaling, the connection request was routed over data lines, which could immediately send back a \"line busy\" response. This did not require the trunk line to be used at all. Although this might save only a few seconds, with millions of such calls being placed every day, the advantages quickly added up.\n\nAt the time, phreakers felt there was nothing [[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]] could do to stop blue boxing because it would require Bell to upgrade all their hardware.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1971}} That was precisely what Bell was already planning to do, but as the network already included large numbers of existing switches that were susceptible to blue boxing, the switchover would take some time.\n\nFor the immediate term, Bell responded with a number of countermeasures. As existing [[electronic switching system]]s maintained logs of all calls made, including calls to [[toll-free telephone number]]s, Bell began examining the logs looking for suspicious patterns of activity. For instance, lengthy repeated calls to information or national hotel reservation numbers might indicate the presence of a phreaker using a particular line. In this case, filters could be installed on those lines to block the blue box. Bell also would wiretap the affected lines. In one 1975 case, the [[Pacific Bell|Pacific Telephone Company]] targeted one defendant's line with the following equipment:\n* A CMC 2600, a device which registers on a counter the number of times a 2600&nbsp;Hz tone is detected on the line;\n* A tape recorder, activated automatically by the CMC 2600 to record two minutes of telephone audio after each burst of 2600&nbsp;Hz activity; and\n* A Hekemian 51A, which replicates the functions of the CMC 2600 and also produces a paper tape print-out of outgoing calls. Ordinary calls were recorded in black ink and destination numbers called via the blue box were recorded in red ink.<ref>[https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/563/563.F2d.967.76-3391.html UNITED STATES of America vs. Bernard CORNFELD, dba Grayhall Inc], No. 76-3391, United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. Oct. 27, 1977.</ref>\n\n== Demise and legacy ==\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, some legacy trunks were modified to filter out [[Single-frequency signaling|single frequency tones]] arriving from a caller. \n\nThe development of digital switching equipment and [[out-of-band signaling]] systems with separate bearer and signaling channels (such as [[Common Channel Interoffice Signaling]] and [[Signaling System 7]]) prevented the use of blue boxes. The \"blue box\" terminology has since been [[blue box recycling system|recycled for other purposes]]. The hacking community evolved into other endeavors{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} and there currently exists a commercially published hacking magazine, titled ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly|2600]]'', a reference to the 2600&nbsp;Hz tone that was once central to so much of telephone hacking.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.2600.com/wall/24-05-2016 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602035336/http://www.2600.com/wall/24-05-2016 |archive-date=2016-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Frequencies and timings ==\nEach multifrequency tone consists of two frequencies chosen from a set of six, shown in the table on the left.

The 'KP' and 'KP2' tones are sent for 100ms. KP2 (ST2 in the [[R1 standard]]) was used for dialing internal Bell System telephone numbers. However, actual frequency durations can vary depending on location, switch type, and the machine status.\n\nThis set of MF tones was originally devised for [[Bell System]] [[switchboard operator|long-distance operators]] placing calls manually, and predates the DTMF ''Touch-Tone'' system used by subscribers.

For instance, [[area code 519|519]]+044+121 may reach the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] inward operator and 519+034+121 the [[London, Ontario|London]] inward operator 175&nbsp;km distant, but in the same area code.<ref>[http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs/trg/TRG-1977-Sec10-Part16-Canada.pdf Traffic Routing Guide], AT&T, 1977</ref>\n\n== Blue boxes in other countries ==\nAnother signaling system widely used on international circuits (except those terminating in North America) was [[CCITT]] Signaling System No. 4 (friendly named 'SS4').\n\nTechnical definitions are specified in formerly CCITT (now [[ITU-T]]) Recommendations Q.120 to Q.139.<ref>CCITT SS4 / ITU-T Q.120-139 https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-Q.120-Q.139-198811-I!!PDF-E&type=items</ref>\n\nThis was also an in-band system but, instead of using multifrequency signals for digits, it used four 35 ms pulses of tone, separated by 35 ms of silence, to represent digits in four-bit binary code, with 2400&nbsp;Hz as a '0' and 2040&nbsp;Hz as a '1'. The supervisory signals used the same two frequencies, but each supervisory signal started with both tones together (for 150 ms) followed, without a gap, by a long (350 ms) or short (100 ms) period of a single tone of 2400&nbsp;Hz or 2040&nbsp;Hz. Phreaks in Europe built System 4 blue boxes that generated these signals. Because System 4 was used only on international circuits, the use of these blue boxes was more specialized.\n\nTypically, a phreak would gain access to international dialing at low or zero cost by some other means, make a dialed call to a country that was available via direct dialing, and then use the System 4 blue box to clear down the international connection and make a call to a destination that was available only via operator service. Thus, the System 4 blue box was used primarily as a way of setting up calls to hard-to-reach operator-only destinations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA typical System 4 blue box had a keypad (for sending four-bit digit signals) plus four buttons for the four supervisory signals (clear-forward, seize-terminal, seize-transit, and transfer-to-operator). After some experimentation, nimble-fingered phreaks found that all they really needed was two buttons, one for each frequency. With practice, it was possible to manually generate all the signals with sufficient timing precision, including the digit signals. This made it possible to make the blue box quite small.\n\nA refinement added to some System 4 blue boxes was an anti-acknowledgement-echo guard tone. Because the connection between the telephone and the telephone network is two-wire, but the signalling on the international circuit operates on a four-wire basis (totally separate send and receive paths), signal-acknowledgement tones (single pulses of one of the two frequencies from the far end of the circuit after receipt of each digit) tended to be reflected back at the four-wire/two-wire conversion point. Although these reflected signals were relatively faint, they were sometimes loud enough for the digit-receiving circuits at the far end to treat them as the first bit of the next digit, messing up the phreak's transmitted digits.\n\nWhat the improved blue box did was to continuously transmit a tone of some other frequency (e.g., 600&nbsp;Hz) as a guard tone whenever it was not sending a System 4 signal. This guard tone drowned out the echoed acknowledgement signals, so that only the blue box-transmitted digits were heard by the digit-receiving circuits at the far end.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Falsing]]\n* [[Operation Cybersnare]] \u2013 Story involving Blue Boxing from the United States\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite magazine |magazine=Esquire |date=1 October 1971 |title=Secrets of the Little Blue Box |first=Ron |last=Rosenbaum |url=https://classic.esquire.com/article/1971/10/1/secrets-of-the-blue-box |ref=harv}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.nerdnetworks.org/sarts/ The SARTS technical journal]\n* [http://myoldmac.net/FAQ/TheBlueBox-1.htm Secrets of the Little Blue Box \u2013 article with photos]\n* [http://www.artofhacking.com/tucops/phreak/boxes/blue/index.htm All about the Blue Box and related devices]\n* [http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/BLUEBOXING/ Text files about blue boxing]\n* [http://www.elfqrin.com/docs/hakref/phrkbox/phreakboxes.html The definitive guide to Phreak boxes]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121119114513/http://www.porticus.org/bell/pdf/funwithdickandjane.pdf Fun with Dick and Jane by Lewis Gum and Edward Oxford \u2013 article that appeared in the 1978 Bell Telephone Magazine about telephone fraud and Phone Phreaks]\n* [http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/ A site dedicated to the history of phone phreaking, with extensive information on blue boxing.]\n* [http://www.projectmf.org/ A working, publicly accessible simulation of the old telephone network that allows legal blue boxing.

[[Queen Maya]] came to bear the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] after receiving a prophetic dream in which she foresaw the descent of the Bodhisattva (Buddha-to-be) from the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita]] heaven into her womb.
