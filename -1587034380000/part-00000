The bridge crosses the [[River Thames]] close to the [[Tower of London]] and has become an iconic symbol of London. As a result, it is sometimes confused with [[London Bridge]], about half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]], a charitable trust overseen by the [[City of London Corporation]]. It is the only one of the trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].\n\nThe bridge consists of two [[bridge tower]]s tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal [[Tension (physics)|tension]] forces imposed by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower.\n\nThe bridge deck is freely accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians, whereas the bridge's twin towers, high-level walkways and Victorian engine rooms form part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition, for which an admission charge is made. The nearest [[London Underground]] tube stations are [[Tower Hill tube station|Tower Hill]] on the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[District line]]s, [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] on the [[Jubilee line|Jubilee]] and [[Northern line|Northern]] lines and [[Bermondsey tube station|Bermondsey]] on the Jubilee line, and the nearest [[List of Docklands Light Railway stations|Docklands Light Railway station]] is [[Tower Gateway DLR station|Tower Gateway]].<ref name=coltbe>{{cite web |url = http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/Exhibition/ |title = Tower Bridge Exhibition website |publisher = Corporation of The City of London |accessdate = 18 November 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101112055741/http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/Exhibition/ |archivedate = 12 November 2010 }}</ref> The nearest [[National Rail]] stations are at [[Fenchurch Street railway station|Fenchurch Street]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Inception ===\n[[File:Tower bridge schm020.png|thumb|right|Elevation, with dimensions]]\nIn the second half of the 19th century, increased commercial development in the [[East End of London]] led to demands for a new river crossing downstream of [[London Bridge]]. A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by [[sailing ships]] to the port facilities in the [[Pool of London]], between London Bridge and the Tower of London.{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}\n\nA ''Special Bridge or Subway Committee'' was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution.{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|p=159}} More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]], which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. A design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a [[bascule bridge]].{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|pp=158,160}} Sir [[John Wolfe Barry]] was appointed engineer and Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] the architect  (who was also one of the judges).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=148}} An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction. It specified the opening span must give a clear width of {{convert|61|m|ft|0|order=flip}} and a headroom of {{convert|41|m|ft|0|order=flip}}. Construction had to be in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\nBarry designed a bridge with two [[bridge tower]]s built on piers. The central [[Span (architecture)|span]] was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass. The two side-spans were suspension bridges, with rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained in the bridge's upper walkways.{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:Tower bridge works 1892.jpg|left|thumb|Tower Bridge under construction, 1892]]\nConstruction started in 1886 and took eight years with five major contractors \u2013 [[John Jackson (UK politician)|Sir John Jackson]] (foundations), [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Baron Armstrong]] (hydraulics), [[William Webster (builder)|William Webster]], Sir [[Herbert Bartlett|H.H.

Opened in 1870, Tower Subway was among the world's earliest underground (\"tube\") railways, but it closed after just three months and was re-opened as a pedestrian foot tunnel. Once Tower Bridge was open, the majority of foot traffic transferred to using the bridge, there being no toll to pay to use it. Having lost most of its income, the tunnel was closed in 1898.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nThe high-level open air walkways between the towers gained a reputation as a haunt for prostitutes and [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]]; as they were only accessible by stairs they were seldom used by regular pedestrians, and were closed in 1910.<ref name=\"walkway\">{{cite news|title=Tower Bridge: fascinating facts and figures|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/south-east/london-bridge/articles/Tower-Bridge-fascinating-facts-and-figures/|agency=The Telegraph|date=8 January 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Rough Guides|1998|p=152}} The walkway reopened in 1982 as part of the Tower Bridge Exhibition.<ref name=\"walkway\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/vertigo-calling-walkways-at-londons-tower-bridge-outfitted-with-glass|title=Vertigo calling: Walkways at London's Tower Bridge outfitted with glass floors|first=Matt|last=Hickman|work=Mother Nature Network|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:This picture, taken during the first mass air raid on London, 7th September 1940, describes more than words ever... - NARA - 541917.tif|thumb|left|Tower Bridge during the first mass air raid on London, 7 September 1940]]\n[[File:SHort Sunderland V DP198 201.A Tower Br 16.09.56 edited-3.jpg|thumb|A [[Short Sunderland]] of [[No. 201 Squadron RAF]] moored at Tower Bridge during the 1956 commemoration of the [[Battle of Britain]]]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]] and as a precaution against the existing engines being damaged by enemy action, a third engine was installed in 1942: a 150&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] horizontal cross-compound engine, built by [[Vickers Armstrong Ltd.]] at their Elswick works in Newcastle upon Tyne.

The bridge crosses the [[River Thames]] close to the [[Tower of London]] and has become an iconic symbol of London. As a result, it is sometimes confused with [[London Bridge]], about half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) upstream. Tower Bridge is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the [[Bridge House Estates]], a charitable trust overseen by the [[City of London Corporation]]. It is the only one of the trust's bridges not to connect the City of London directly to the Southwark bank, as its northern landfall is in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].\n\nThe bridge consists of two [[bridge tower]]s tied together at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal [[Tension (physics)|tension]] forces imposed by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical components of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers.

A traditional fixed bridge at street level could not be built because it would cut off access by [[sailing ships]] to the port facilities in the [[Pool of London]], between London Bridge and the Tower of London.{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}\n\nA ''Special Bridge or Subway Committee'' was formed in 1877, chaired by Sir Albert Joseph Altman, to find a solution.{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|p=159}} More than fifty designs were submitted, including one from civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]], which was rejected because of a lack of sufficient headroom. A design was not approved until 1884, when it was decided to build a [[bascule bridge]].{{sfn|Bracken|2011|p=56}}{{sfn|Welch|Barry|1894|pp=158,160}} Sir [[John Wolfe Barry]] was appointed engineer and Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] the architect  (who was also one of the judges).{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=148}} An Act of Parliament was passed in 1885 authorising the bridge's construction.

Construction had to be in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]].{{sfn|Weinreb|Hibbert|Keay|Keay|2008|p=922}}\n\nBarry designed a bridge with two [[bridge tower]]s built on piers. The central [[Span (architecture)|span]] was split into two equal bascules or leaves, which could be raised to allow river traffic to pass.
