Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner.

Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Hitler's Germany could only develop if Germany's policy changed. Molotov then stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was by re-joining the [[League of Nations]], but even that was not sufficient.

Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.

Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, and ratified a [[Lend-Lease]] Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the [[United States government]], albeit vaguely, promised to open up a second front against Germany.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]]. The plan created several [[bilateral relation]]s between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA).<ref>{{Cite book | author = Roberts, Geoffrey | title = The Soviet Union in world politics: coexistence, revolution, and cold war, 1945\u20131991 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 284\u2013285 | authorlink = Geoffrey Roberts }}</ref>\n\nIn the postwar period, Molotov's power began to decline.

Immediately afterwards, Polina was arrested and accused of ties with [[Zionist]] organisations. She was imprisoned for a year in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]], after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed.

As Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had played a leading role in the purges, it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power, and he became the leader of an old guard faction that sought to overthrow Khrushchev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=666\u2013667}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-33241-0001, Moskau, Gala-Vorstellung f\u00fcr BRD-Regierungsdelegation.jpg|thumb|right|Molotov (far left) with Khrushchev (second from right) and Premier [[Nikolai Bulganin]] (to the left of Khrushchev) in 1955 at a gala reception in Moscow for the visit of West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] (centre)]]In June 1956, Molotov was removed as Foreign Minister;{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=245}} on 29 June 1957, he was expelled from the Presidium (Politburo) after a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary.

Molotov served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (Premier) from 1930 to 1941, and as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1939 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1956. He served as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] from 1942 to 1957, when he was dismissed from the Presidium of the Central Committee by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Molotov was removed from all positions in 1961 after several years of obscurity.\n\nMolotov was the principal Soviet signatory of the [[Nazi Germany|German]]\u2013Soviet [[non-aggression pact]] of 1939 (also known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]), whose most important provisions were added in the form of a secret protocol that stipulated an invasion of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and partition of its territory between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union. \n\nAfter World War II (the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), Molotov was involved in negotiations with the Western allies, in which he became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov in a speech to the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]]. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's [[de-Stalinisation]] policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career (1890\u20131930)===\n[[Image:Molotov house Kukarka.JPG|thumb|200px|Molotov's birth house in [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast]].|left]]\n\nMolotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skryabin in the village of [[Sovetsk, Kirov Oblast|Kukarka]], [[Yaransk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Vyatka Governorate]] (now Sovetsk in [[Kirov Oblast]]), the son of a butter churner. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} Throughout his teen years, he was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\", always assisting his father with his business. He was educated at a secondary school in [[Kazan]], and joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) in 1906, soon gravitating toward that organisation's radical [[Bolshevik]] faction, headed by [[V. I. Lenin]].<ref name=Roberts5>[[Geoffrey Roberts]], ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior.''

In 1911, he enrolled at [[St Petersburg]] Polytechnic. Molotov joined the editorial staff of a new underground Bolshevik newspaper called ''[[Pravda]]'', meeting [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time in association with the project.<ref name=Roberts6>Roberts, ''Molotov'', pg. 6.</ref> This first association between the two future Soviet leaders proved to be brief, however, and did not lead to an immediate close political association.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\n[[File:Molotov VM.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Molotov in 1917]]\n\nMolotov worked as a so-called \"professional revolutionary\" for the next several years, writing for the party press and attempting to better organize the underground party.<ref name=Roberts6 /> He moved from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1914 at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> It was in Moscow the following year that Molotov was again arrested for his party activity, this time being deported to [[Irkutsk]] in eastern [[Siberia]].<ref name=Roberts6 /> In 1916, he escaped from his Siberian exile and returned to the capital city, now called Petrograd by the Tsarist regime, which thought the name St. Petersburg sounded excessively German.<ref name=Roberts6 />\n\nhe was nicknamed \"chav\" by his friends and was also referred to as Lazza, or Larry, due to his great, great uncle Larry Wain who was charged of assault. \n\nMolotov became a member of the Bolshevik Party's committee in [[Petrograd]] in 1916. When the [[February Revolution]] occurred in 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital.

Since he was not a military man, he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Orgburo]], and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] in 1921 and held the office of [[Responsible Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Responsible Secretary]] and also married the Soviet politician [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]].\n\nHis Responsible Secretaryship was criticised by Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], with Lenin noting his \"shameful bureaucratism\" and stupid behaviour.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=40}} On the advice of Molotov and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], the Central Committee decided to reduce Lenin's work hours.{{sfn|Service|2003|p=151}} In 1922, Stalin became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party]] with Molotov as the ''de facto'' [[Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Second Secretary]].

Molotov had made it clear that improved relations with Hitler's Germany could only develop if Germany's policy changed. Molotov then stated that one of the best ways for Germany to improve relations was by re-joining the [[League of Nations]], but even that was not sufficient. Germany still had to give proof 'of its respect for international obligations in keeping with the real interests of peace in Europe and peace generally'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molotov and the Sovnarkom 1930\u20131941|last=Watson|first=Derek|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> As Litvinov during 1933 and 1934 had done his best to prevent the cordial relations created by Rapallo from declining, some do not think Litvinov would have disapproved of that statement; and if German policy had changed, Litvinov would have been delighted. However, Robert Conquest, unlike Watson, believed that the reason for Stalin's temporary rift with Molotov was not concerned with foreign policy but stemmed from the fact that Stalin was incensed with Molotov for attempting to try and dissuade Stalin from staging the famous trials against the old colleagues of Lenin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Great Terror|last=Conquest|first=Robert|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}</ref> Molotov, in the same interview, denied the continued existence of internal enemies except for a few isolated cases.

In his book ''Crisis in the Kremlin'', he states:\n\n<blockquote>It is well known in Moscow that Molotov always detested Litvinov.  Molotov's detestation for Litvinov was purely of a personal nature.  No Moscovite I have ever known, whether a friend of Molotov or of Litvinov, has ever taken exception to this view.  Molotov was always resentful of Litvinov's fluency in French, German and English, as he was distrustful of Litvinov's easy manner with foreigners.  Never having lived abroad, Molotov always suspected that there was something impure and sinful in Litvinov's broad mindedness and appreciation of Western civilisation.<ref>Hindus Maurice Crisis in the Kremlin</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Litvinov never mentioned his relationship with Molotov in the foreign commissariat, Narkomindel press officer Genedin states: even though Litvinov never referred to their relationship (between Litvinov and Molotov) it was nevertheless well known it was bad.  Litvinov had no respect for a small minded intriguer and accomplice in terror like Molotov, and Molotov for his part had no love for Litvinov, who incidentally was the one people's commissioner to retain his independence.<ref>Medvedev All Stalin's Men p.488</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Purge Stalin Voroshilov Kaganovich Zhdanov Molotov.jpg|thumb|A list from the [[Great Purge]] signed by Molotov, Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich|Kaganovich]] and [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]]|293x293px]]\n\nMolotov was succeeded in his post as Premier by Stalin.{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nAt first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided the content of the treaty.\n\nThe most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and the [[Baltic States]] between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of [[Bessarabia]] (then part of [[Romania]], now [[Moldova]]).{{sfn|Service|2003|p=256}} This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]], which began on 1 September.{{sfn|Brown|2009|pp=90\u201392}} On 5 March 1940, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] gave Molotov, along with [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin, a note proposing the execution of 25,700 Polish officers and [[anti-Soviet]]s, in what has become known as the [[Katyn massacre]].{{sfn|Brown|2009|p=141}}\n\nUnder the Pact's terms, Hitler was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy two-thirds of [[Western Poland]], as well as [[Lithuania]]. Molotov was given a free hand in relation to Finland. In the [[Winter War]] that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence.{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=256\u2013257}} The Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland.

In January 1941, the British Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] visited Turkey in an attempt to get the Turks to enter the war on the Allies' side. Though the purpose of Eden's visit was anti-German rather than anti-Soviet, Molotov assumed otherwise, and in a series of conversations with the Italian Ambassador Augusto Rosso, Molotov claimed that the Soviet Union would soon be faced with an Anglo\u2013Turkish invasion of the [[Crimea]]. The British historian D.C. Watt argued that, on the basis of Molotov's statements to Rosso, it would appear that, in early 1941, Stalin and Molotov viewed Britain rather than Germany as the principal threat.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Cameron Watt, Donald | title = Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy | publisher = [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 276\u2013286 }}</ref>\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Molotov meets with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] before signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]]]] \nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet\u2013German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain, turned east and [[German invasion of the Soviet Union|attacked the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Service|2003|pp=158\u2013160}} Molotov was responsible for telling the [[Soviet people]] of the attack, when he instead of Stalin announced the war.

He took a secret flight to [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], where he was greeted by Eden. This risky flight, in a high altitude [[Tupolev TB-7]] bomber, flew over German-occupied [[Denmark]] and the [[North Sea]]. From there, he took a train to London to discuss with the [[British government]] the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.\n\nAfter signing the [[Anglo\u2013Soviet Treaty of 1942]] on 26 May, Molotov left for Washington, D.C., in the United States. Molotov met with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the President of the United States, and ratified a [[Lend-Lease]] Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the [[United States government]], albeit vaguely, promised to open up a second front against Germany.

In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, at the direction of the Soviet government, condemned the [[Marshall Plan]] as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, initiated what is known as the [[Molotov Plan]]. The plan created several [[bilateral relation]]s between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (CMEA).<ref>{{Cite book | author = Roberts, Geoffrey | title = The Soviet Union in world politics: coexistence, revolution, and cold war, 1945\u20131991 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-14435-3 | pages = 284\u2013285 | authorlink = Geoffrey Roberts }}</ref>\n\nIn the postwar period, Molotov's power began to decline.

She was imprisoned for a year in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]], after which she was exiled for three years in an obscure Russian city. Molotov had no communication with her, save for the scant news that he got from Beria, whom he loathed. Polina was freed immediately after the death of Stalin.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}} According to Erofeev, Molotov said of her: \"She's not only beautiful and intelligent, the only woman minister in the Soviet Union; she's also a real [[Bolshevik]], a real Soviet person.\" \n[[File:Polina Zhemchuzhina.jpg|thumb|Molotov with his wife [[Polina Zhemchuzhina|Polina]]]]\nHowever Polina's feelings were not reciprocal.

Holroyd-Doveton has discovered a statement by the Italian Communist Vittorio Vidali that he was told by Yelena Dmitryevna at the 20th Congress that Polina refused to return to her husband.  It is hardly surprising.  It is difficult to believe any wife would not be infuriated if they were being tortured while their husband was holding high political office.

However, since [[pest control]] was increasingly regulated in the 1980s, its numbers have started to grow again.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThere are three [[species]] of European cockchafers:\n\n*The '''common cockchafer''', ''Melolontha melolontha''\n*The '''forest cockchafer''', ''Melolontha hippocastani''\n*The '''large cockchafer''', ''Melolontha pectoralis'', rarer and less widespread than the other two species.\n\n==Description==\n[[Imago|Adults]] of the common cockchafer reach sizes of 25\u201330&nbsp;mm; the forest cockchafer is a little smaller (20\u201325&nbsp;mm). The two species can best be distinguished by the form of their [[pygidium|tail end]]: it is long and slender in the common cockchafer, but shorter and knob-shaped at the end in the forest cockchafer. Both have a brown colour.[[File:Cockchafer.JPG|thumb|Close up of a male cockchafer, showing the seven \"leaves\" on the antennae]] Male cockchafers have seven \"leaves\" on their [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e, whereas the females have only six.\n\nThe species ''M. pectoralis'' looks similar, but its pygidium is rounded. The cockchafer should not be confused with the similar [[European chafer]] (''Rhizotrogus majalis''), which has a completely different [[#Life cycle|life cycle]], nor with the [[June beetle]]s (''Phyllophaga'' spp.), which are native to [[North America]], nor with the [[summer chafer]] (or \"European June bug\", ''Amphimallon solstitiale''), which emerges in June and has a two-year life cycle. (All of these are [[Scarabaeidae]], have white grubs, and are turf pests.)\n\n==Life cycle==\n[[File:Feldmaik\u00e4fer (Melolontha melolontha) w 3.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n[[File:Maikaefer-kalt.jpg|thumb|left|Male]]\nAdults appear at the end of April or in May and live for about five to seven weeks. After about two weeks, the female begins laying eggs, which she buries about 10 to 20&nbsp;cm deep in the earth. She may do this several times until she has laid between 60 and 80 eggs. The common cockchafer lays its eggs in fields, whereas the Forest Cockchafer stays in the vicinity of the trees. The preferred food for adults is [[oak]] leaves, but they will also feed on [[conifer]] needles.\n\nThe [[larva]]e, known as \"[[white grub]]s\" or \"chafer grubs\", hatch after four to six weeks. They feed on plant roots, for instance [[potato]] roots. The grubs develop in the earth for three to four years, in colder climates even five years, and grow continually to a size of about 4\u20135&nbsp;cm, before they [[pupation|pupate]] in early autumn and develop into an adult cockchafer in six weeks.\n\nThe cockchafer overwinters in the earth at depths between 20 and 100&nbsp;cm. They work their way to the surface only in spring.\n\nBecause of their long development time as larvae, cockchafers appear in a cycle of every three or four years; the years vary from region to region. There is a larger cycle of around 30 years superimposed, in which they occur (or rather, used to occur) in unusually high numbers (10,000s).\n\n==Pest control and history==\n[[File:cockshaferlarvae.jpg|thumb|Larva (grub)]]\nBoth the grubs and [[imago]]s have a voracious appetite and thus have been and sometimes continue to be a major problem in [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]]. In  the pre-[[industrialization|industrialized]] era, the main mechanism to control their numbers was to collect and kill the adult beetles, thereby interrupting the cycle. They were once very abundant: in 1911, more than 20 million individuals were collected in 18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest.<ref name=BugLife/>\n\nCollecting adults was an only moderately successful method. In the [[Middle Ages]], pest control was rare, and people had no effective means to protect their harvest. This gave rise to events that seem bizarre from a modern perspective. In 1320, for instance, cockchafers were brought to [[court]] in [[Avignon]] and sentenced to withdraw within three days onto a specially designated area, otherwise they would be outlawed. Subsequently, since they failed to comply, they were collected and killed. (Similar [[animal trial]]s also occurred for many other animals in the Middle Ages.)<ref name=\"barton\">Barton, K.: ''[http://lichtenberg-gesellschaft.de/pdf/jb04_barton.pdf Verfluchte Kreaturen: Lichtenbergs \"Proben seltsamen Aberglaubens\" und die Logik der Hexen- und Insektenverfolgung im \"Malleus Maleficarum\"]'', in Joost, U.; Neumann, A.

In German.</ref>\n\nIn some areas and times, cockchafers were served [[insects as food|as food]]. A 19th-century recipe from [[France]] for cockchafer soup reads: \"roast one [[Pound (mass)|pound]] of cockchafers without wings and legs in sizzling [[butter]], then cook them in a [[chicken]] soup, add some [[veal]] liver and serve with [[chives]] on a [[toast]]\". A [[Germany|German]] newspaper from [[Fulda]] from the 1920s tells of students eating [[sugar]]-coated cockchafers. Cockchafer larvae can also be fried or cooked over open flames, although they require some preparation by soaking in vinegar in order to purge them of soil in their digestive tracts.<ref>http://www.bugsfeed.com/cooking_cockchafer</ref> A cockchafer stew is referred to in [[W. G. Sebald]]'s novel ''[[The Emigrants (German novel)|The Emigrants]]''.\n\nOnly with the modernization of agriculture in the 20th century and the invention of chemical pesticides did it become possible to effectively combat the cockchafer. Combined with the transformation of many pastures into agricultural land, this has resulted in a decrease of the cockchafer to near-extinction in some areas in Europe in the 1970s. Since then, agriculture has generally reduced its use of pesticides. Because of [[natural environment|environmental]] and [[public health]] concerns (pesticides may enter the [[food chain]] and thus also the [[human body]]) many chemical pesticides have been phased out in the [[European Union]] and worldwide. In recent years, the cockchafer's numbers have been increasing again, causing damage to over 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land all over Europe. At present, no chemical pesticides are approved for use against cockchafers, and only biological measures are utilised for control: for instance, pathogenic [[fungi]] or [[nematodes]] that kill the grubs are applied to the soil.\n\n==In culture==\nChildren since antiquity have played with cockchafers. In ancient [[Greece]], boys caught the insect, tied a [[linen]] thread to its feet and set it free, amusing themselves to watch it fly in spirals.

However, since [[pest control]] was increasingly regulated in the 1980s, its numbers have started to grow again.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThere are three [[species]] of European cockchafers:\n\n*The '''common cockchafer''', ''Melolontha melolontha''\n*The '''forest cockchafer''', ''Melolontha hippocastani''\n*The '''large cockchafer''', ''Melolontha pectoralis'', rarer and less widespread than the other two species.\n\n==Description==\n[[Imago|Adults]] of the common cockchafer reach sizes of 25\u201330&nbsp;mm; the forest cockchafer is a little smaller (20\u201325&nbsp;mm). The two species can best be distinguished by the form of their [[pygidium|tail end]]: it is long and slender in the common cockchafer, but shorter and knob-shaped at the end in the forest cockchafer. Both have a brown colour.[[File:Cockchafer.JPG|thumb|Close up of a male cockchafer, showing the seven \"leaves\" on the antennae]] Male cockchafers have seven \"leaves\" on their [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e, whereas the females have only six.\n\nThe species ''M. pectoralis'' looks similar, but its pygidium is rounded. The cockchafer should not be confused with the similar [[European chafer]] (''Rhizotrogus majalis''), which has a completely different [[#Life cycle|life cycle]], nor with the [[June beetle]]s (''Phyllophaga'' spp.), which are native to [[North America]], nor with the [[summer chafer]] (or \"European June bug\", ''Amphimallon solstitiale''), which emerges in June and has a two-year life cycle. (All of these are [[Scarabaeidae]], have white grubs, and are turf pests.)\n\n==Life cycle==\n[[File:Feldmaik\u00e4fer (Melolontha melolontha) w 3.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n[[File:Maikaefer-kalt.jpg|thumb|left|Male]]\nAdults appear at the end of April or in May and live for about five to seven weeks. After about two weeks, the female begins laying eggs, which she buries about 10 to 20&nbsp;cm deep in the earth. She may do this several times until she has laid between 60 and 80 eggs. The common cockchafer lays its eggs in fields, whereas the Forest Cockchafer stays in the vicinity of the trees. The preferred food for adults is [[oak]] leaves, but they will also feed on [[conifer]] needles.\n\nThe [[larva]]e, known as \"[[white grub]]s\" or \"chafer grubs\", hatch after four to six weeks. They feed on plant roots, for instance [[potato]] roots. The grubs develop in the earth for three to four years, in colder climates even five years, and grow continually to a size of about 4\u20135&nbsp;cm, before they [[pupation|pupate]] in early autumn and develop into an adult cockchafer in six weeks.\n\nThe cockchafer overwinters in the earth at depths between 20 and 100&nbsp;cm. They work their way to the surface only in spring.\n\nBecause of their long development time as larvae, cockchafers appear in a cycle of every three or four years; the years vary from region to region. There is a larger cycle of around 30 years superimposed, in which they occur (or rather, used to occur) in unusually high numbers (10,000s).\n\n==Pest control and history==\n[[File:cockshaferlarvae.jpg|thumb|Larva (grub)]]\nBoth the grubs and [[imago]]s have a voracious appetite and thus have been and sometimes continue to be a major problem in [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]]. In  the pre-[[industrialization|industrialized]] era, the main mechanism to control their numbers was to collect and kill the adult beetles, thereby interrupting the cycle. They were once very abundant: in 1911, more than 20 million individuals were collected in 18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of forest.<ref name=BugLife/>\n\nCollecting adults was an only moderately successful method. In the [[Middle Ages]], pest control was rare, and people had no effective means to protect their harvest. This gave rise to events that seem bizarre from a modern perspective. In 1320, for instance, cockchafers were brought to [[court]] in [[Avignon]] and sentenced to withdraw within three days onto a specially designated area, otherwise they would be outlawed. Subsequently, since they failed to comply, they were collected and killed. (Similar [[animal trial]]s also occurred for many other animals in the Middle Ages.)<ref name=\"barton\">Barton, K.: ''[http://lichtenberg-gesellschaft.de/pdf/jb04_barton.pdf Verfluchte Kreaturen: Lichtenbergs \"Proben seltsamen Aberglaubens\" und die Logik der Hexen- und Insektenverfolgung im \"Malleus Maleficarum\"]'', in Joost, U.; Neumann, A.

In German.</ref>\n\nIn some areas and times, cockchafers were served [[insects as food|as food]]. A 19th-century recipe from [[France]] for cockchafer soup reads: \"roast one [[Pound (mass)|pound]] of cockchafers without wings and legs in sizzling [[butter]], then cook them in a [[chicken]] soup, add some [[veal]] liver and serve with [[chives]] on a [[toast]]\". A [[Germany|German]] newspaper from [[Fulda]] from the 1920s tells of students eating [[sugar]]-coated cockchafers. Cockchafer larvae can also be fried or cooked over open flames, although they require some preparation by soaking in vinegar in order to purge them of soil in their digestive tracts.<ref>http://www.bugsfeed.com/cooking_cockchafer</ref> A cockchafer stew is referred to in [[W. G. Sebald]]'s novel ''[[The Emigrants (German novel)|The Emigrants]]''.\n\nOnly with the modernization of agriculture in the 20th century and the invention of chemical pesticides did it become possible to effectively combat the cockchafer. Combined with the transformation of many pastures into agricultural land, this has resulted in a decrease of the cockchafer to near-extinction in some areas in Europe in the 1970s. Since then, agriculture has generally reduced its use of pesticides. Because of [[natural environment|environmental]] and [[public health]] concerns (pesticides may enter the [[food chain]] and thus also the [[human body]]) many chemical pesticides have been phased out in the [[European Union]] and worldwide. In recent years, the cockchafer's numbers have been increasing again, causing damage to over 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of land all over Europe. At present, no chemical pesticides are approved for use against cockchafers, and only biological measures are utilised for control: for instance, pathogenic [[fungi]] or [[nematodes]] that kill the grubs are applied to the soil.\n\n==In culture==\nChildren since antiquity have played with cockchafers. In ancient [[Greece]], boys caught the insect, tied a [[linen]] thread to its feet and set it free, amusing themselves to watch it fly in spirals. English boys in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times played a very similar game by sticking a pin through one of its wings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peter Parley's annual: A Christmas and New Year's present for young people |authorlink=Samuel Clark, Ben George, Peter Parley, Samuel Griswold Goodrich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSIGAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=sv&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=1866 |accessdate=2017-05-27 }}--</ref> [[Nikola Tesla]] recalls that as a child he made one of his first \"inventions\"&mdash;an \"[[engine]]\" made by harnessing four cockchafers in this fashion.<ref>{{cite news |title=My Inventions |first=Nikola |last=Tesla |authorlink=Nikola Tesla |url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=My_Inventions&oldid=2194693 |newspaper=Electrical Experimenter |date=1919 |accessdate=2011-05-13 }}--</ref>\n\nCockchafers appear in the fairy tales [[Thumbelina]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Princess Rosette]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].\n\n[[File:Max und Moritz (Busch) 051.png|thumb|right|''[[Max and Moritz]]'' shaking cockchafers from a tree]]\n\nThe cockchafer is featured in a German children's rhyme similar to the English ''[[Ladybird, Ladybird]]'':\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|\n{{lang|de|{{linktext|Maik\u00e4fer}} flieg...<br>\nDein Vater ist im Krieg<br>\nDeine Mutter ist in Pommerland<br>\nPommerland ist abgebrannt<br>\nMaik\u00e4fer flieg!}}\n|\nCockchafer fly...<br>\nYour father is at war<br>\nYour mother is in [[Pomerania]]<br>\nPomerania is burned to the ground<br>\nCockchafer fly!\n|}\n\nThe verse dates back to the [[Thirty Years' War]] in the first half of the 17th Century, in which [[Pomerania]] was pillaged and suffered heavily.

In ''Imaginators'', there are a few characters (Crash Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, Wild Storm, and Ro-Bow) that act as level unlockers.\n\n==Universe==\n===Characters===\nWhile the Skylanders are the main playable characters in the series, they are aided by many supporting characters and face many villains throughout their adventures. The players act as \"Portal Masters\" where they place the Skylander figure on the portal to operate them.\n\nSpyro the Dragon is a popular Skylander where he is the number one defender of Skylands. Each of the Skylanders were discovered by a Portal Master named Master Eon, Spyro, or another Skylander after they were shown fighting off threats to their homeland. Some Skylanders, like Camo, are based off artworks or media.\n\nKnown allies of the Skylanders include the Mabu pilot Flynn, the Mabu adventurer Cali, Master Eon's Mabu assistant Hugo, the Woodburrow inhabitant Tessa and her bird Whiskers, the fairy Persephone, and the veteran Mabu Buzz.\n\nA dark Portal Master named Kaos serves as the primary antagonist of the series. Outside of being served by his Troll butler Glumshanks, Kaos is served by armies of Cyclopes, Drows, Chompies, Greebles, Spell Punks, and Trolls, as well as numerous other supporting characters such as Kaossandra, Mesmerelda, the Darkness, and Brain.\n\n===Skylands===\nThe '''Skylands''' is the main setting of the series, a world lying at the very center of the universe. It consists of many floating islands where each one has its own ecosystems like forests, rainforests, deserts, arctic areas, swamps, mountains, and oceanic areas.\n\nEach of the games has a hub where the Skylanders can start their missions from:\n* For ''Spyro's Adventure'', it is the ruins as the Hub where Master Eon's citadel was located and was slowly restored when the Core of Light was reassembled. In the Nintendo 3DS version, it was replaced by the Sanctuary.\n* ''Giants'' has Flynn's airship, The Dread-Yacht.\n* ''Swap Force'' has Tessa's homeland of Woodburrow, the capital city of the Cloudbreak Islands. In the 3DS version, it was replaced by Flynn's hometown called Boom Town.\n* ''Trap Team'', ''SuperChargers'', and ''Imaginators'' have the Skylanders Academy established by Buzz where those who want to become Skylanders get their education. By ''SuperChargers'', the Skylanders Academy was redesigned following recent attacks.\n* Along with the Academy, ''Imaginators '' has the ''Mysterious Ancient Place'' (M.A.P.), the place where all creation was created and serves as the Ancients' headquarters. It connects the game's chapters and the Academy.\n\n==Music==\n[[Lorne Balfe]] has composed the soundtracks to all the ''Skylanders'' games thus far, while [[Hans Zimmer]] composed the main theme.\n\n==Media==\n===Novels===\nA series of books in the ''Skylanders'' franchise started with ''Skylanders: The Machine of Doom'' that takes place before the events of ''Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure''. It was written by [[Cavan Scott]], who would later write sequels to the novel under the ''Skylanders: The Mask of Power'' series, which also serve as prequels to ''Spyro's Adventure''.\n\n===IDW

It is the very center of the universe where it is constantly threatened by evil forces who seek to rule Skylands and gain access to all worlds.<ref>Skylanders: The Machine of Doom, page 43</ref> Luckily, a band of heroes called the Skylanders use their abilities and machinery to defend their world from various threats, which they have done for generations. They have worked with the Portal Masters in keeping peace and balance in Skylands, battling the forces of evil, and protecting the Core of Light. Unfortunately, Kaos (the main antagonist of the franchise) has destroyed the Core of Light (in the first game Spyro's adventure) and now Skylands is in his hands. It is up to the player to send the Skylanders into the game and stop Kaos. The Skylanders have an unbreakable bond with their Portal Masters. Though they are not servants, the Skylanders chose to serve their Portal Master and do so eagerly. Each Skylander is associated with one of the ten elements of Skylands: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Magic, Tech, Life, Undead, Light, and Dark( both recently added).\n\nThe main plot is the Skylanders going through levels to defeat Kaos, the series' main antagonist, and stop him from ruling over Skylands.\n\nThe console versions of each game follow identical storylines, while the [[Nintendo 3DS]] versions follow stories different from those of the console versions.\n\n==Games==\n{{Video game timeline\n| 2011 = ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure|Spyro's Adventure]]''\n| 2012 = ''[[Skylanders: Giants|Giants]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Skylanders: Swap Force|Swap Force]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Skylanders: Trap Team|Trap Team]]''\n| 2015 = ''[[Skylanders: SuperChargers|SuperChargers]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Skylanders: Imaginators|Imaginators]]''\n}}\n\n===''Spyro's Adventure'' (2011)===\n{{Main|Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure}}\nThis is the very first edition of the Skylanders franchise.

In ''Imaginators'', there are a few characters (Crash Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, Wild Storm, and Ro-Bow) that act as level unlockers.\n\n==Universe==\n===Characters===\nWhile the Skylanders are the main playable characters in the series, they are aided by many supporting characters and face many villains throughout their adventures. The players act as \"Portal Masters\" where they place the Skylander figure on the portal to operate them.\n\nSpyro the Dragon is a popular Skylander where he is the number one defender of Skylands. Each of the Skylanders were discovered by a Portal Master named Master Eon, Spyro, or another Skylander after they were shown fighting off threats to their homeland. Some Skylanders, like Camo, are based off artworks or media.\n\nKnown allies of the Skylanders include the Mabu pilot Flynn, the Mabu adventurer Cali, Master Eon's Mabu assistant Hugo, the Woodburrow inhabitant Tessa and her bird Whiskers, the fairy Persephone, and the veteran Mabu Buzz.\n\nA dark Portal Master named Kaos serves as the primary antagonist of the series. Outside of being served by his Troll butler Glumshanks, Kaos is served by armies of Cyclopes, Drows, Chompies, Greebles, Spell Punks, and Trolls, as well as numerous other supporting characters such as Kaossandra, Mesmerelda, the Darkness, and Brain.\n\n===Skylands===\nThe '''Skylands''' is the main setting of the series, a world lying at the very center of the universe. It consists of many floating islands where each one has its own ecosystems like forests, rainforests, deserts, arctic areas, swamps, mountains, and oceanic areas.\n\nEach of the games has a hub where the Skylanders can start their missions from:\n* For ''Spyro's Adventure'', it is the ruins as the Hub where Master Eon's citadel was located and was slowly restored when the Core of Light was reassembled. In the Nintendo 3DS version, it was replaced by the Sanctuary.\n* ''Giants'' has Flynn's airship, The Dread-Yacht.\n* ''Swap Force'' has Tessa's homeland of Woodburrow, the capital city of the Cloudbreak Islands. In the 3DS version, it was replaced by Flynn's hometown called Boom Town.\n* ''Trap Team'', ''SuperChargers'', and ''Imaginators'' have the Skylanders Academy established by Buzz where those who want to become Skylanders get their education. By ''SuperChargers'', the Skylanders Academy was redesigned following recent attacks.\n* Along with the Academy, ''Imaginators '' has the ''Mysterious Ancient Place'' (M.A.P.), the place where all creation was created and serves as the Ancients' headquarters. It connects the game's chapters and the Academy.\n\n==Music==\n[[Lorne Balfe]] has composed the soundtracks to all the ''Skylanders'' games thus far, while [[Hans Zimmer]] composed the main theme.\n\n==Media==\n===Novels===\nA series of books in the ''Skylanders'' franchise started with ''Skylanders: The Machine of Doom'' that takes place before the events of ''Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure''. It was written by [[Cavan Scott]], who would later write sequels to the novel under the ''Skylanders: The Mask of Power'' series, which also serve as prequels to ''Spyro's Adventure''.\n\n===IDW

Jean Kurt Forest was succeeded as artistic director by Dieter-Gerhard Worm.\n\nIn 1980, following the initial collaboration with [[Hartmut Haenchen]] and then his appointment as artistic director, this specialist modern music orchestra changed its profile to concentrate on early classical repertoire, in particular that of the composer it was named after and his contemporaries. The reason for this change was state regulation by the [[East German]] government, which exerted influence on which contemporary works should be played. From these experiences arose the idea of searching for rediscoveries in Berlin musical history and of naming [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Friedrich the Great]]\u2019s court harpsichordist, the ensemble\u2019s patron.\n\nBy the 1980s, [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], whose music belongs to the avant-garde of the 18th century, had been virtually forgotten. The orchestra\u2019s extensive recordings of C.P.E. Bach\u2019s works, many of them first recordings, were distinguished with numerous prizes. The C.P.E. Bach Chamber Orchestra held a special place in Berlin\u2019s musical life as \u201ca point of reference for excellence of quality and unmistakable style\u201d (Berliner Zeitung). There followed tours and invitations to festivals, and the chamber orchestra was a guest in Japan, Italy, Austria (Salzburg Festival, Vienna Musikwochen), the Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Switzerland, as well as at Germany's most important music festivals, such as the Brandenburgischer Musiksommer, the [[Dresdner Musikfestspiele]], the [[Ludwigsburger Schlossfestspiele]], the Mozartfest W\u00fcrzburg, the [[Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival]], the [[Schwetzinger Festspiele]] and the Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It performed with world-famous soloists including [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Anne-Sophie Mutter]], [[Deborah Polaski]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Christine Sch\u00e4fer]] and [[Frank Peter Zimmermann]], as well as with [[Peter Schreier]] as singer and conductor. TV productions, radio broadcasts and 62 CDs and DVDs document the artistic quality of the ensemble.\n\nThe chamber orchestra continually extended its repertoire from the Baroque to Classical, Romantic and modern classics, dedicating itself as much to [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] as to [[Schubert]], [[Mozart]] and in particular to [[Joseph Haydn]]. The heart of the work of the chamber orchestra, which consisted of 25 musicians (strings and wind) from Berlin's top orchestras, and of artistic director, was its own concert series, established in 1984, with 5 concerts per season in the Chamber Music Hall of the [[Berlin Philharmonie]] and the Great Hall of the Berlin Konzerthaus. Numerous rediscoveries, particularly works from the Berlin-Brandenburg musical tradition, were given their first performances in modern times in this concert series. The economic independence of this series was a financial and organisational challenge, which the orchestra overcame every year without public funding, as all involved waived their artists\u2019 fees.\nIn 2014 the chamber orchestra looked back on 45 years of musical and contemporary history to celebrate a 34-year collaboration with [[Hartmut Haenchen]]. On 1 May 2014 the orchestra was disbanded and ceased its concert activity.\n\n== The style of the chamber orchestra ==\n\nUnder the artistic direction of Hartmut Haenchen, a specific understanding of music, musico-structural analysis and virtuosity characterised the ensemble's successful interpretations. \u201cThe orchestra plays on modern instruments, without ignoring current historical performance practice. This results in remarkably intense and lively performances, which are deeply rooted in the score rather than amounting to nothing more than superficial pseudo-historical sound\u201d (FonoForum). Alertness and agility distinguished the ensemble's concerts and recordings, \u201cfinely graded agogic nuances, precise assessment and moderate use of tonal space, controlled expressivity\u201d (Berliner Zeitung) renders them unmistakable. While preparing the musical scores, Hartmut Haenchen referred to a knowledge resource of more than 200 theoretical texts from the 16th to 18th centuries. However, this was not to recreate an [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/texte/?user_haenchendatabase_pi14%5Buid%5D=6&cHash=a46d57c325c6086ce75b7b2bb666c740 \u201cauthentic\u201d performance], which many argue cannot exist in modern performance, but to create one of many possible interpretations according to stylistic insight. In order to present the intentions of a historical composition today with meaning, the interpretations concentrated on issues and statements that one can relate to today.\n\n== Discography == \nChronological selection, Catalogue numbers refer to the first CD edition\n\n;Recordings under Hartmut Haenchen\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=9&cHash=4441832722d806ce291d1bdd01c15950 Early classical horn concertos] with Peter Damm, 1981, BERLIN Classics 0032102BC\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=10&cHash=98b80e8d981221eccd27fe7324456a7a Friedrich II: Symphonies and flute concertos] with Manfred Friedrich, 1982, CAPRICCIO 10064, featured record of the month\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=11&cHash=5bf6dbec41802473bcf8d5a2c79a19c5 Oboe concertos] by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giuseppe Ferlendis and Franz Anton R\u00f6\u00dfler with Burkhard Gl\u00e4tzner, 1984, CAPRICCIO 10 087\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=13&cHash=b9cecd092dbad05c87f40cf10be5b43c C.Ph.E.

Jean Kurt Forest was succeeded as artistic director by Dieter-Gerhard Worm.\n\nIn 1980, following the initial collaboration with [[Hartmut Haenchen]] and then his appointment as artistic director, this specialist modern music orchestra changed its profile to concentrate on early classical repertoire, in particular that of the composer it was named after and his contemporaries. The reason for this change was state regulation by the [[East German]] government, which exerted influence on which contemporary works should be played. From these experiences arose the idea of searching for rediscoveries in Berlin musical history and of naming [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Friedrich the Great]]\u2019s court harpsichordist, the ensemble\u2019s patron.\n\nBy the 1980s, [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], whose music belongs to the avant-garde of the 18th century, had been virtually forgotten. The orchestra\u2019s extensive recordings of C.P.E. Bach\u2019s works, many of them first recordings, were distinguished with numerous prizes. The C.P.E. Bach Chamber Orchestra held a special place in Berlin\u2019s musical life as \u201ca point of reference for excellence of quality and unmistakable style\u201d (Berliner Zeitung). There followed tours and invitations to festivals, and the chamber orchestra was a guest in Japan, Italy, Austria (Salzburg Festival, Vienna Musikwochen), the Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Switzerland, as well as at Germany's most important music festivals, such as the Brandenburgischer Musiksommer, the [[Dresdner Musikfestspiele]], the [[Ludwigsburger Schlossfestspiele]], the Mozartfest W\u00fcrzburg, the [[Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival]], the [[Schwetzinger Festspiele]] and the Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. It performed with world-famous soloists including [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Anne-Sophie Mutter]], [[Deborah Polaski]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Christine Sch\u00e4fer]] and [[Frank Peter Zimmermann]], as well as with [[Peter Schreier]] as singer and conductor. TV productions, radio broadcasts and 62 CDs and DVDs document the artistic quality of the ensemble.\n\nThe chamber orchestra continually extended its repertoire from the Baroque to Classical, Romantic and modern classics, dedicating itself as much to [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] as to [[Schubert]], [[Mozart]] and in particular to [[Joseph Haydn]]. The heart of the work of the chamber orchestra, which consisted of 25 musicians (strings and wind) from Berlin's top orchestras, and of artistic director, was its own concert series, established in 1984, with 5 concerts per season in the Chamber Music Hall of the [[Berlin Philharmonie]] and the Great Hall of the Berlin Konzerthaus. Numerous rediscoveries, particularly works from the Berlin-Brandenburg musical tradition, were given their first performances in modern times in this concert series. The economic independence of this series was a financial and organisational challenge, which the orchestra overcame every year without public funding, as all involved waived their artists\u2019 fees.\nIn 2014 the chamber orchestra looked back on 45 years of musical and contemporary history to celebrate a 34-year collaboration with [[Hartmut Haenchen]]. On 1 May 2014 the orchestra was disbanded and ceased its concert activity.\n\n== The style of the chamber orchestra ==\n\nUnder the artistic direction of Hartmut Haenchen, a specific understanding of music, musico-structural analysis and virtuosity characterised the ensemble's successful interpretations. \u201cThe orchestra plays on modern instruments, without ignoring current historical performance practice. This results in remarkably intense and lively performances, which are deeply rooted in the score rather than amounting to nothing more than superficial pseudo-historical sound\u201d (FonoForum). Alertness and agility distinguished the ensemble's concerts and recordings, \u201cfinely graded agogic nuances, precise assessment and moderate use of tonal space, controlled expressivity\u201d (Berliner Zeitung) renders them unmistakable. While preparing the musical scores, Hartmut Haenchen referred to a knowledge resource of more than 200 theoretical texts from the 16th to 18th centuries. However, this was not to recreate an [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/texte/?user_haenchendatabase_pi14%5Buid%5D=6&cHash=a46d57c325c6086ce75b7b2bb666c740 \u201cauthentic\u201d performance], which many argue cannot exist in modern performance, but to create one of many possible interpretations according to stylistic insight. In order to present the intentions of a historical composition today with meaning, the interpretations concentrated on issues and statements that one can relate to today.\n\n== Discography == \nChronological selection, Catalogue numbers refer to the first CD edition\n\n;Recordings under Hartmut Haenchen\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=9&cHash=4441832722d806ce291d1bdd01c15950 Early classical horn concertos] with Peter Damm, 1981, BERLIN Classics 0032102BC\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=10&cHash=98b80e8d981221eccd27fe7324456a7a Friedrich II: Symphonies and flute concertos] with Manfred Friedrich, 1982, CAPRICCIO 10064, featured record of the month\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=11&cHash=5bf6dbec41802473bcf8d5a2c79a19c5 Oboe concertos] by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giuseppe Ferlendis and Franz Anton R\u00f6\u00dfler with Burkhard Gl\u00e4tzner, 1984, CAPRICCIO 10 087\n* [http://www.haenchen.net/veroeffentlichungen/diskographie/?user_haenchendatabase_pi3%5Buid%5D=13&cHash=b9cecd092dbad05c87f40cf10be5b43c C.Ph.E.

{"title_page": "Anime and manga fandom", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2010}}\n{{Anime and manga}}\n'''Anime and manga fandom''' (otherwise known as '''fan community''') is a worldwide community of fans of [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Anime includes [[animation|animated]] [[wikt:serial|series]], films and videos, while manga includes [[manga]], [[graphic novels]], drawings and related artwork. They have their origin in Japanese entertainment, but the style and culture has spread worldwide since its introduction into [[Western world|the West]] in the 1990s.\n\n== Otaku ==\n{{Main|Otaku}}\n''Otaku'' is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, including anime, manga or video games. In its original context, the term ''otaku'' is derived from a Japanese term for another's house or family ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u304a\u5b85|\u304a\u5b85]],}} ''otaku''), which is also used as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. The modern [[slang]] form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (\u304a\u305f\u304f) or [[katakana]] (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af or, less frequently, \u30f2\u30bf\u30af), or rarely in [[r\u014dmaji]], appeared in the 1980s. In the anime [[Macross]], first aired in 1982, the term was used by [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]] as an honorific term.<ref>May 2006 issue of ''EX Taishuu'' magazine</ref><ref name=\"NRI\">\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u7814\u7a76(Otaku Shijou no Kenkyuu), \u91ce\u6751\u7e3d\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u6240(Nomura Research Institute), {{ISBN|978-986-124-768-7}}</ref> It appears to have been coined by the humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]] in his 1983 series {{nihongo|''An Investigation of \"Otaku\"''|\u300e\u304a\u305f\u304f\u300f\u306e\u7814\u7a76|\"Otaku\" no Kenky\u016b}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]''. Animators like [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] used the term among themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> After its wild spread usage by other Japanese people, however, it became [[pejorative]] and increasingly offensive in the 1990s, implying that a person is socially inept. ''Otaku'' can be seen as being similar to the English terms ''[[geek]]'' or ''[[nerd]]''.\n\nHowever, the term started to be used by anime and manga fans themselves again starting in the 2000s, in a more general and positive way, and today it is often used by those outside of the fandom to refer to fans of anime or manga. However, older generation otaku, like ''Otaking'' (King of Otakus) [[Toshio Okada]], in his book ''Otaku Wa Sude Ni Shindeiru'' (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u306f\u3059\u3067\u306b\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b) said the newer generation of self-proclaimed otakus are not real otakus, as they lack the passion and research sense into a particular sub-culture subject, and are only common fans which only over spent in buying products.\n\n== History of the community ==\n{{See also|History of anime|Manga outside Japan}}\n\nAnime and manga fandom traces back to at least the 1970s when after [[Space Battleship Yamato]]; stopped airing on Japanese [[television]], fans of the \nseries banded together to get ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' back on the air after it stopped airing on Japanese [[television]].<ref>{{cite web | title = An Overview of Yamato Fan History, Part 1 | url = http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=53ad571dd98998f6e351cf607ccd182b | publisher = [[Voyager Entertainment]] | accessdate = May 10, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531042519/http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=a517f630dab6ea69371c4eae5e6c756d| archivedate= 31 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> In Japan, anime and manga are referred to collectively as the content industry: anime, video games, manga, and other related merchandise are different types of media focused around the same content.<ref name=\"Manion\">{{cite journal | last = Manion | first = Annie | year = 2005 | title = Discovering Japan: Anime and Learning Japanese Culture. | journal = East Asian Studies Center, USC | url = http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | accessdate = April 27, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171215035736/http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | archive-date = December 15, 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the manga market in Japan is beginning to decline. In 2007, the manga industry showed a 4% decrease in sales from the previous year, its fifth consecutive year of decline. Japanese and American researchers have proposed that this may be due to the decrease in the young population in Japan and a lack of interest in reading. The manga critic and translator [[Matt Thorn]] stated that there was a growing dissatisfaction with the lack of originality found in many manga.<ref>{{cite news | title = Quantcast Manga Sales in Japan Decline for Fifth Consecutive Year | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = October 20, 2007 | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-20/manga-sales-in-japan-decline-for-fifth-consecutive-year | accessdate = April 28, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090408075235/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-20/manga-sales-in-japan-decline-for-fifth-consecutive-year| archivedate= 8 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Al Kahn, CEO of [[4Kids Entertainment]], stated that \"Manga is a problem because we are in a culture that is not a reading culture\" and that \"Manga is dying in Japan.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = Al | last = Kahn | title = Sparks Fly at ICv2 Anime/Manga Conference | publisher = ICv2 | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11741.html | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref> Liza Coppola, vice president of [[Viz Media]], said that the widespread availability of cell phones and ability to view anime and manga on cell phones is likely the cause of decline in demand for anime and manga.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Liza Coppola, Part 3 | publisher = ICv2 | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11741.html | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== English-language fan communities ===\nThe fan community in the English-speaking world began in the 1970s and steadily grew.

It was the first exposure of Filipinos to Japanese animation. ''Voltes&nbsp;V'' soon became very popular between children all around the Philippines which led to the sudden popularity of other anime series' related to the [[Super Robot]] genre in the Philippines. It was soon banned in 1979 by then president [[Ferdinand Marcos]], five episodes before the end of the series, along with the other anime series' airing at the time, for its violence and warlike themes. This however, did not hinder the Filipinos' growing love of anime, leading to the large popularity of anime and manga throughout the Philippines.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mann|first=William|title=Filipinos short-circuit 'Voltes V'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6gEkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4941,5305880&dq=voltes+v&hl=en|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=24 September 1979}}</ref>\n\nPoitras identifies the first generation as the \"Astro Boy Generation\". Despite being the first and most popular animated Japanese television series, ''[[Astro Boy]]'' did not create many hardcore fans, but it exposed viewers to the medium and increased their receptivity towards it later on. The \"Early Fans\" or \"Old Timers\" generation that consumed titles like ''[[Speed Racer]]'', ''[[Eighth Man]]'', and ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' as staples. These fans were much more aware that what they were consuming was Japanese and took the initiative to search for more. The \"Yamato\" or \"Star Blazers\" generation originating from the series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' that originally aired in 1979\u201380. Poitras states that this generation was so loyal because ''Star Blazer'''s strong narration required viewers to never miss an episode. The Poitras dubs the next generation the \"Robotech Generation\", after the 1985 television series ''[[Robotech]]'', is the earliest major generation in the USA and is distinguished by fans clearly recognizing anime as a Japanese product with significant differences from American animation. Fans from this generation and the Yamato Generation were to make up the significant portion of organized fandom throughout the 1980s. The film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', which played in art theaters in December 1989, produced a cult following that Poitras names the \"Akira Generation\". ''Akira'' inspired some to move on to other works but stalled many becoming an isolated work in their eyes, overshadowing the creative context of anime and manga it represented.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nThen in the 1990s, Poitras states that \"something new happened in the U.S.\", the \"Sailor Moon Generation\" was born. Previous generations consisted mostly of college age fans, however in 1995 ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' was adapted into English and caught the attention of people even as young as grade school in age, many of them female. In the span of a few months, the fan demographic changed dramatically and as their interests diversified, so did the titles adapted into English. Poitras, Lewis and Sterling describe current generation of fans as the \"Otaku Generation\", however not necessarily applying the word \"[[otaku]]\" to current fans. For this generation, the release of a title onto the television in the past was unusual enough that fans often remember their first anime experience as something special. Poitras remarked that as of the \"Otaku Generation\", the influx of fans into the fandom is better characterized by a continuous stream than as waves as it was in the past.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nIn the United States, the fan community began as an offshoot of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan community]], with fans bringing imported copies of Japanese [[manga]] to [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Jason H. | last = Bennett | title = A Preliminary History of American Anime Fandom | url = http://a-kon.co/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | publisher = University of Texas at Arlington | accessdate = May 10, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022644/http://a-kon.com/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25}}</ref> Before anime began to be licensed in the U.S., fans who wanted to get a hold of anime would leak copies of anime movies and subtitle them, thus marking the start of [[fansubs]]. By 1994, anime had become more common in the U.S., and had begun being translated into English and shown on television, most commonly [[sh\u014dnen]] series such as [[Pok\u00e9mon]] and [[Astro Boy]].<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nAccording to [[Mike Tatsugawa]], the founder and CEO of the [[Anime Expo|Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation]], the first milestone for anime in the U.S. was in the 1980s with the advent of the [[Internet]]. With the Internet, fans were able to more easily communicate with each other and thus better able to exchange [[Fansub|fan-subtitled]] tapes and higher quality versions of anime.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{Cite news | last = Gardiner | first = Debbi | title = Anime in America | publisher = Japan Inc Communications | magazine=J@pan Inc Magazine |date = January 2003| url = http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=972 | accessdate = May 1, 2009}}</ref> Some experts, such as Susan Napier, a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, say that ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' marked the first milestone.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> However, most experts agree that the next milestone was in 1992 when [[U.S. Renditions]], a film importer, released the first English-subtitled anime videotape that year, entitled ''[[Gunbuster]]''. According to Tatsugawa, the success of ''Gunbuster'' triggered a flurry of releases.<ref name=\"Gardiner\" />\n\nDue to the [[Language localisation|localization]] process, many people who grew up watching anime did so not realizing that it originated in Japan. After the success of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' (which first aired in 1993), U.S. television companies began broadcasting ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' in 1995 and 1996 respectively. However, due to the relative failure of the latter two (both shows brought success when aired at a later time on [[Cartoon Network]]), anime did not seem like it would become mainstream.<ref name=\"Manion\" /> However, the anime boom in the U.S. began with the airing of the anime series ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''<ref name=\"Manion\" /> in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1998, which served as proof to U.S. broadcasters and distributors that Japanese media could succeed in the U.S. market. It was only after ''Pok\u00e9mon'' and ''Power Rangers'' left the mainstream that U.S. audiences became aware of anime's Japanese origins.<ref name=\"Manion\" />\n\n==== Anime streaming outlets in the United States ====\nIn the United States there are a couple streaming outlets that fans can use to view anime and manga, while also being able to connect with those communities. One such outlet is [[Crunchyroll]], a streaming service that lets users view popular anime from the past and new anime episodes released to the website. Crunchyroll was created in 2006 as a distribution outlet for anime. Crunchyroll has since evolved into becoming something more for fans in the anime community. They have added an addition to their website that allows anime and manga fans to get news about anime releases, events, and topics related to the community. This has also evolved to the creation of the [[Crunchyroll Expo]]. This exposition is a large scale event in San Jose, CA that allows anime and manga fans to connect. The streaming service also features a store where you can purchase anime related products such as: figures, Japanese snacks, apparel, posters, video games and manga.\n\nIn addition, another streaming service within the United States is [[Funimation]]. Similar to Crunchyroll, Funimation allows you to view newly released anime while also offering a store with products similar to Crunchyroll. Funimation's website also has a section created for events related to anime and manga that allows their members to connect at the local and national level.

However these works were not recognized as Japanese productions and did not earn much of a dedicated fanbase. However Italy, Spain and France grew an interest for more Japanese animation for their television programming, due to success of previous co-productions, Japan's productive output and cheap selling price in comparison to US animation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style - The Three Markets|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0azMCgAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2015-10-23|isbn = 9781317519911|language = en|first = Giannalberto|last = Bendazzi}}</ref> Particularly Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Italian anime boom: The outstanding success of Japanese animation in Italy, 1978\u20131984|journal = Journal of Italian Cinema & Media Studies|date = 2014-09-01|pages = 363\u2013381|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1386/jicms.2.3.363_1|first = Marco|last = Pellitteri}}</ref> Like in the Philippines, the [[Super Robot]] Genre became very popular with series such as ''[[UFO Robot Grendizer]]'' and ''[[Mazinger Z]]''.

Anime includes [[animation|animated]] [[wikt:serial|series]], films and videos, while manga includes [[manga]], [[graphic novels]], drawings and related artwork. They have their origin in Japanese entertainment, but the style and culture has spread worldwide since its introduction into [[Western world|the West]] in the 1990s.\n\n== Otaku ==\n{{Main|Otaku}}\n''Otaku'' is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, including anime, manga or video games. In its original context, the term ''otaku'' is derived from a Japanese term for another's house or family ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u304a\u5b85|\u304a\u5b85]],}} ''otaku''), which is also used as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. The modern [[slang]] form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (\u304a\u305f\u304f) or [[katakana]] (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af or, less frequently, \u30f2\u30bf\u30af), or rarely in [[r\u014dmaji]], appeared in the 1980s. In the anime [[Macross]], first aired in 1982, the term was used by [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]] as an honorific term.<ref>May 2006 issue of ''EX Taishuu'' magazine</ref><ref name=\"NRI\">\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u7814\u7a76(Otaku Shijou no Kenkyuu), \u91ce\u6751\u7e3d\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u6240(Nomura Research Institute), {{ISBN|978-986-124-768-7}}</ref> It appears to have been coined by the humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]] in his 1983 series {{nihongo|''An Investigation of \"Otaku\"''|\u300e\u304a\u305f\u304f\u300f\u306e\u7814\u7a76|\"Otaku\" no Kenky\u016b}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]''. Animators like [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] used the term among themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> After its wild spread usage by other Japanese people, however, it became [[pejorative]] and increasingly offensive in the 1990s, implying that a person is socially inept. ''Otaku'' can be seen as being similar to the English terms ''[[geek]]'' or ''[[nerd]]''.\n\nHowever, the term started to be used by anime and manga fans themselves again starting in the 2000s, in a more general and positive way, and today it is often used by those outside of the fandom to refer to fans of anime or manga. However, older generation otaku, like ''Otaking'' (King of Otakus) [[Toshio Okada]], in his book ''Otaku Wa Sude Ni Shindeiru'' (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u306f\u3059\u3067\u306b\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b) said the newer generation of self-proclaimed otakus are not real otakus, as they lack the passion and research sense into a particular sub-culture subject, and are only common fans which only over spent in buying products.\n\n== History of the community ==\n{{See also|History of anime|Manga outside Japan}}\n\nAnime and manga fandom traces back to at least the 1970s when after [[Space Battleship Yamato]]; stopped airing on Japanese [[television]], fans of the \nseries banded together to get ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' back on the air after it stopped airing on Japanese [[television]].<ref>{{cite web | title = An Overview of Yamato Fan History, Part 1 | url = http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=53ad571dd98998f6e351cf607ccd182b | publisher = [[Voyager Entertainment]] | accessdate = May 10, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531042519/http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=a517f630dab6ea69371c4eae5e6c756d| archivedate= 31 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> In Japan, anime and manga are referred to collectively as the content industry: anime, video games, manga, and other related merchandise are different types of media focused around the same content.<ref name=\"Manion\">{{cite journal | last = Manion | first = Annie | year = 2005 | title = Discovering Japan: Anime and Learning Japanese Culture. | journal = East Asian Studies Center, USC | url = http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | accessdate = April 27, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171215035736/http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | archive-date = December 15, 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the manga market in Japan is beginning to decline.

''Voltes&nbsp;V'' soon became very popular between children all around the Philippines which led to the sudden popularity of other anime series' related to the [[Super Robot]] genre in the Philippines. It was soon banned in 1979 by then president [[Ferdinand Marcos]], five episodes before the end of the series, along with the other anime series' airing at the time, for its violence and warlike themes. This however, did not hinder the Filipinos' growing love of anime, leading to the large popularity of anime and manga throughout the Philippines.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mann|first=William|title=Filipinos short-circuit 'Voltes V'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6gEkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4941,5305880&dq=voltes+v&hl=en|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=24 September 1979}}</ref>\n\nPoitras identifies the first generation as the \"Astro Boy Generation\". Despite being the first and most popular animated Japanese television series, ''[[Astro Boy]]'' did not create many hardcore fans, but it exposed viewers to the medium and increased their receptivity towards it later on. The \"Early Fans\" or \"Old Timers\" generation that consumed titles like ''[[Speed Racer]]'', ''[[Eighth Man]]'', and ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' as staples. These fans were much more aware that what they were consuming was Japanese and took the initiative to search for more. The \"Yamato\" or \"Star Blazers\" generation originating from the series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' that originally aired in 1979\u201380. Poitras states that this generation was so loyal because ''Star Blazer'''s strong narration required viewers to never miss an episode. The Poitras dubs the next generation the \"Robotech Generation\", after the 1985 television series ''[[Robotech]]'', is the earliest major generation in the USA and is distinguished by fans clearly recognizing anime as a Japanese product with significant differences from American animation. Fans from this generation and the Yamato Generation were to make up the significant portion of organized fandom throughout the 1980s. The film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', which played in art theaters in December 1989, produced a cult following that Poitras names the \"Akira Generation\". ''Akira'' inspired some to move on to other works but stalled many becoming an isolated work in their eyes, overshadowing the creative context of anime and manga it represented.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nThen in the 1990s, Poitras states that \"something new happened in the U.S.\", the \"Sailor Moon Generation\" was born. Previous generations consisted mostly of college age fans, however in 1995 ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' was adapted into English and caught the attention of people even as young as grade school in age, many of them female. In the span of a few months, the fan demographic changed dramatically and as their interests diversified, so did the titles adapted into English. Poitras, Lewis and Sterling describe current generation of fans as the \"Otaku Generation\", however not necessarily applying the word \"[[otaku]]\" to current fans. For this generation, the release of a title onto the television in the past was unusual enough that fans often remember their first anime experience as something special. Poitras remarked that as of the \"Otaku Generation\", the influx of fans into the fandom is better characterized by a continuous stream than as waves as it was in the past.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nIn the United States, the fan community began as an offshoot of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan community]], with fans bringing imported copies of Japanese [[manga]] to [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Jason H. | last = Bennett | title = A Preliminary History of American Anime Fandom | url = http://a-kon.co/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | publisher = University of Texas at Arlington | accessdate = May 10, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022644/http://a-kon.com/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25}}</ref> Before anime began to be licensed in the U.S., fans who wanted to get a hold of anime would leak copies of anime movies and subtitle them, thus marking the start of [[fansubs]]. By 1994, anime had become more common in the U.S., and had begun being translated into English and shown on television, most commonly [[sh\u014dnen]] series such as [[Pok\u00e9mon]] and [[Astro Boy]].<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nAccording to [[Mike Tatsugawa]], the founder and CEO of the [[Anime Expo|Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation]], the first milestone for anime in the U.S. was in the 1980s with the advent of the [[Internet]]. With the Internet, fans were able to more easily communicate with each other and thus better able to exchange [[Fansub|fan-subtitled]] tapes and higher quality versions of anime.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{Cite news | last = Gardiner | first = Debbi | title = Anime in America | publisher = Japan Inc Communications | magazine=J@pan Inc Magazine |date = January 2003| url = http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=972 | accessdate = May 1, 2009}}</ref> Some experts, such as Susan Napier, a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, say that ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' marked the first milestone.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> However, most experts agree that the next milestone was in 1992 when [[U.S. Renditions]], a film importer, released the first English-subtitled anime videotape that year, entitled ''[[Gunbuster]]''. According to Tatsugawa, the success of ''Gunbuster'' triggered a flurry of releases.<ref name=\"Gardiner\" />\n\nDue to the [[Language localisation|localization]] process, many people who grew up watching anime did so not realizing that it originated in Japan. After the success of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' (which first aired in 1993), U.S. television companies began broadcasting ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' in 1995 and 1996 respectively. However, due to the relative failure of the latter two (both shows brought success when aired at a later time on [[Cartoon Network]]), anime did not seem like it would become mainstream.<ref name=\"Manion\" /> However, the anime boom in the U.S. began with the airing of the anime series ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''<ref name=\"Manion\" /> in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1998, which served as proof to U.S. broadcasters and distributors that Japanese media could succeed in the U.S. market. It was only after ''Pok\u00e9mon'' and ''Power Rangers'' left the mainstream that U.S. audiences became aware of anime's Japanese origins.<ref name=\"Manion\" />\n\n==== Anime streaming outlets in the United States ====\nIn the United States there are a couple streaming outlets that fans can use to view anime and manga, while also being able to connect with those communities. One such outlet is [[Crunchyroll]], a streaming service that lets users view popular anime from the past and new anime episodes released to the website. Crunchyroll was created in 2006 as a distribution outlet for anime. Crunchyroll has since evolved into becoming something more for fans in the anime community. They have added an addition to their website that allows anime and manga fans to get news about anime releases, events, and topics related to the community. This has also evolved to the creation of the [[Crunchyroll Expo]]. This exposition is a large scale event in San Jose, CA that allows anime and manga fans to connect. The streaming service also features a store where you can purchase anime related products such as: figures, Japanese snacks, apparel, posters, video games and manga.\n\nIn addition, another streaming service within the United States is [[Funimation]]. Similar to Crunchyroll, Funimation allows you to view newly released anime while also offering a store with products similar to Crunchyroll. Funimation's website also has a section created for events related to anime and manga that allows their members to connect at the local and national level. There is also a blog section that allows those with an account on Funimation to connect with other fans and talk about their favorite, or maybe even least favorite, anime and episode. \n\n=== European fan communities (France, Italy, Spain and Germany) ===\nIn the 1970s, Japanese Animation reached Europe mainly with productions aimed at European and Japanese children with the main results being ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps|Heidi]]'', [[Vicky the Viking|''Vicky the Vicking'']] and ''[[Barbapapa]]''. However these works were not recognized as Japanese productions and did not earn much of a dedicated fanbase. However Italy, Spain and France grew an interest for more Japanese animation for their television programming, due to success of previous co-productions, Japan's productive output and cheap selling price in comparison to US animation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style - The Three Markets|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0azMCgAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2015-10-23|isbn = 9781317519911|language = en|first = Giannalberto|last = Bendazzi}}</ref> Particularly Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Italian anime boom: The outstanding success of Japanese animation in Italy, 1978\u20131984|journal = Journal of Italian Cinema & Media Studies|date = 2014-09-01|pages = 363\u2013381|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1386/jicms.2.3.363_1|first = Marco|last = Pellitteri}}</ref> Like in the Philippines, the [[Super Robot]] Genre became very popular with series such as ''[[UFO Robot Grendizer]]'' and ''[[Mazinger Z]]''. However many more genres got added to the mix, with space opera such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', shojo shows like ''[[Candy Candy]]'' and [[The Rose of Versailles|''Rose of Versailles'']], sports like ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' and more. Germany however largely rejected Anime other than western literature adaptations of [[Nippon Animation]], with [[Speed Racer]] and ''[[Captain Future]]'' proving to be problematic. It was only during the rise of cable television during the '90s that Japanese series such as ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', and [[The Rose of Versailles|''Rose of Versailles'']] went on air. A strong affinity for unique Japanese productions was developed among a generation of German children during this period.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anime in Europe |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html |website=www.awn.com |access-date=2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202000517/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html |archivedate=2015-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Appeal of anime and manga ==\nOne major appeal of anime is its artwork; some fans claim that its visual quality is superior to that found in most animated series made in the United States<ref name=\"Gardiner\" /> and many ignore all non-Japanese animation. One fan described enjoying anime because \"there is no dividing line between special effects and what is real...it's just the way somebody imagined it\". The content editor of ''Anime Fringe'', Holly Kolodziejczak, described being amazed by anime's depth that was unlike the cartoons she had seen before: \"the characters had real personalities, their own feelings and motivations for their actions, strengths and flaws that enhanced their characters. They were more like real people, and thus people could much more readily identify with them.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/04.php | last = Kolodziejczak | first = Holly | title = So, this is Point B? - Looking Back, Going Forward |date=December 2005 | accessdate = 2009-05-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417065025/http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/04.php| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Larry Green of [[Nausicaa.net]] agreed and added that anime discusses subjects for both adults and children whereas in the United States animation is traditionally for children.

Napier]], a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, stated that anime fans \"find refuge in a culture that diverges from the typical American way of life.\" She pointed out that fascination with Japanese culture is not a new concept and has existed since the mid-19th century. For example, an 1876 painting by [[Claude Monet]] entitled ''La Japonaise'' depicts Monet's wife wearing a [[kimono]], with Japanese [[Fan (implement)#East Asia|hand fans]] shown in the background. Napier described this interest in Japan as an \"escape from the [[Industrial Revolution]] ... a [[Arcadia (utopia)|pastoral utopia]]\" for many Europeans.<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite news | last = Rogers | first = Carter | title = Professor of Japanese speaks about anime fandom | publisher = [[The Tufts Daily]] | date = February 23, 2009 | url = http://www.tuftsdaily.com/professor-of-japanese-speaks-about-anime-fandom-1.1568757 | accessdate = May 4, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416153226/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/professor-of-japanese-speaks-about-anime-fandom-1.1568757| archivedate= 16 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n=== Fan service ===\n{{Main|Fan service}}\nFan service is material in a series which is intentionally added to please the audience.
