The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

It showed how both come-across the same path and understand the terminology of the alphabet Alif illustrating the bond of an individual with his God.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story follows the lives of several characters, but the four main characters are Taaha, Husn E Jahaan, Qalb E Momin and Momina.  The story is told in flashbacks and moves from the past to the present as well as switching between Turkey and Pakistan. The story opens with Qalb E Momin, a little boy who lives with his mother, Husn E Jahaan, in a little house in Turkey. He writes letters to Allah daily where he asks for material things, because they are not well off. But he also asks for his mother\u2019s happiness and wishes that Allah sends his father back so they can be a family again. It\u2019s slowly revealed through these letters that Husn E Jahaan and Taaha are Momin\u2019s parents and they got into a fight which resulted in Taaha leaving the house \u2013 and did not return (time frame, roughly a year or more). Husn E Jahaan continues to wait for him, sorry for her behavior and full of guilt. Momin lovingly describes his mother as simple, but beautiful and complains that she used to dress up for her father, but no longer does. One day after stumbling upon Momin\u2019s letters to Allah, Husn E Jahaan decides to write a letter of her own to Tahaa and sends it (along with all of Momin\u2019s letters) to the place she believes Taaha is \u2013 his father\u2019s home, Abdul Aala.\n\nThe two receive a letter from Abdul Aala announcing his arrival. Husn E Jahaan happily prepares for Taaha\u2019s return. On the day, Abdul Aala arrives alone. After talking, Husn E Jahaan and Abdul Aala realize that neither knows where Taaha is. They weep and make up as Abdul Aala asks Husn E Jahaan for forgiveness and promises to find Taaha. Time passes and it is discovered that Taaha passed away in a car accident. Heart-broken, Husn E Jahaan and Momin move back to Pakistan. \n\nAbdul Aala is a world-famous calligrapher. His art is housed in many museums and despite his fame and fortune, he lives a simple life in a small house in a small town in Turkey. He devotes his life to Allah and works painting calligraphy dedicated to his Creator. Raising his only son, Taaha, he teaches Taaha the family business as well and Taaha is also a successful calligrapher. Taaha is also a whirling dervish and finds joy in performing at cultural events \u2013 something which Abdul Aala and Taaha clash on, as Abdul Aala believes he should only dance in private for Allah. Taaha goes on to perform at a huge cultural event taking place with performers from all over the world.\n\nHusn E Jahaan is the queen of the Pakistani film industry. A beauty with talent in acting and dancing, she works to support her family, but is not particularly happy doing so. Accompanied by Sultan, her faithful assistant and makeup artist, she visits Turkey to perform at a cultural show. It is here she meets Taaha and everything changes for the two. Sultan is devoted to Husn E Jahaan and he is painfully in love with her.\n\nTaaha falls in love with Husn E Jahaan at first sight and, for the first time in his life, Taaha paints a portrait of a woman.  He gifts the painting to Husn E Jahaan and she is taken.  Husn E Jahaan feels the pull towards Taaha, believing he is the vessel that will change her life and bring her closer to Allah.  She wants to be free of the world of entertainment, a world that thrives on cashing in on a woman\u2019s beauty and body.  She takes great pains in finding something appropriate to wear when going to meet Abdul Aala, driving Sultan crazy by making him find modest clothing, but when she is unsuccessful, she decides to take a white bedsheet and wears it around herself.  This is the extent to which Husn E Jahaan wanted to cleanse her image and her soul.  However, Abdul Aala rejects Husn E Jahaan outright.  While he is a kind soul devoted to his Creator, Abdul Aala is consumed with judgement for Husn E Jahaan, because not only does he believe she\u2019s in an unacceptable profession, but also because he is so hurt that his son has been so badly distracted from religion.  He is furious that in his family lineage of calligraphers, Taaha is the first to have ever painted the portrait of a dancing woman and he believes that shaitaan is dragging Taaha away from Allah.  Abdul Aala\u2019s rejection of Husn E Jahaan causes Taaha to leave home and the two begin their life together without Abdul Aala\u2019s blessings. \nThis rejection of his father\u2019s causes Taaha severe emotional turmoil.  While the two lovebirds are devoted to each other and go on to have a son, their relationship does suffer due to their individual suffering.  While Taaha mourns the loss of his father, he also finds that without his father\u2019s blessings, he can no longer paint and do calligraphy with the perfection he once did.  His paintings now seem \u201cordinary\u201d and he struggles to find buyers \u2013 which means he is unable to earn money.  He cries and curses himself, feeling as though Allah is punishing him.  Watching Taaha in pain also causes Husn E Jahaan pain on a different level.  She feels angry that Abdul Aala did not accept her and has pushed the couple into this position.  She also feels rejection, on a level, from Taaha and feels guilt for doing this to him.  Amidst it all, the two have their son, Qalb E Momin, and they are a close-knit family until one day, Husn E Jahaan and Taaha have a fight and Taaha is never seen again.\n ******\nSwitching to present day, Qalb E Momin is the most popular film director in Pakistan.  An arrogant man, Qalb E Momin knows that anything he touches turns to gold.  He is called the hit-maker and actors and actresses know that if they work in one of his films, even in a side role, they will have a solid career ahead of them in films and television.  Momin is known for objectifying women in his films and the world knows his films run on item numbers and revealing clothing on his actresses.  He does not respect women in this industry.  Set to make his fourth film, \u201cSanam,\u201d he begins casting.  His does have a girlfriend, Neha, who works as a costume designer in his films and proposes to her.  The couple initially seems very happy, but such is the nature of Momin that he cannot forgive, and Neha makes a critical error.  Abdul Aala visits Momin in the middle of a party and is taken aback by Momin\u2019s lifestyle.  While Momin does not hide it from him, Momin has always felt embarrassed to have Abdul Aala see this side of his.  Each year on Momin\u2019s birthday, Abdul Aala gives Momin a piece of his calligraphy which he makes specifically for Momin in an attempt to keep him on the right path.  The two men have very different ideas on right and wrong, Momin feeling Abdul Aala judges his profession and Abdul Aala only wishing to bring his grandson back to religion.  Abdul Aala meets Neha who excitedly begins telling him about Momin\u2019s films and success, which only makes Momin feel worse.  Abdul Aala and Momin have an argument over religion, a common occurrence between the two and Abdul Aala leaves for Turkey shortly afterwards. \nNeha begins pushing Momin to cast her \u201cbest friend,\u201d Zulfi (???), a model who Momin has never met.  Neha\u2019s keen interest in Zulfi turns Momin off and he begins to get upset.  As time goes on, Neha continues to push Momin to cast Zulfi in the lead role and the situation gets intense enough where Neha, certain of her place in Momin\u2019s life, threatens him:  \u201cHire Zulfi as your lead or you will lose me.\u201d  This angers Momin and he cuts off from Neha.  On the announcement launch of his film, he has Zulfi and Neha personally invited and Neha, unaware of Momin\u2019s anger, is elated.  She thinks \u201cI knew he loved me enough to do this for me.\u201d  Unfortunately, she is in for a rude shock when Momin has them both seated in the front row and then not only announces a different male actor (Abbas) for his film, but also has Neha replaced as the costume designer, casting her mortal enemy in her place.  Neha realizes that her relationship with Momin is over and she visits his apartment, throwing his ring back at him and vows to ruin his career.\nMomina Sultan Is a small-time drama actress.  She works in side roles, usually playing the friend of the lead actress.  Despite being highly talented, Momina does not have a strong body of work behind her and is usually overlooked by casting directors for bigger roles.  Her friends Aqsa and Dawood have successful behind-the-scenes positions in the industry and work to help her find roles to keep her household afloat.  Momina\u2019s father, Sultan, worked as a makeup artist and told tales of superstar Husn E Jahaan all day long, devoted to his favorite actress.  \u201cWhat happened to Husn E Jahaan?\u201d Momina would ask.  \u201cShe committed suicide,\u201d Sultan would answer.  Suraiyya, Momina\u2019s mother, worked as a small time singer in the industry.  Jahangir was a successful child star and the apple of their parents eyes.  Everyone expected Jahangir to go on to be a film superstar, but before that dream could come true, he fell ill.  Momina was in art school and was a very dedicated student with a lot of talent.  She was involved with Faisal and the two had plans of getting married.  However, everything changed once Jahangir got sick.  Critically ill, Jahangir needs a kidney transplant.  This forced Momina to quit school and become a \u201cson\u201d for her family.  Faisal went on to get engaged to someone else while Momina moved into the entertainment industry, picking up roles to keep her family going and her brother alive.  The industry was never the goal for Momina, as she was deeply conservative at heart and felt the pull towards God.  In her head, she always felt as though she was doing something wrong.  She does not respect the industry she is in and feels as though her life is a burden.  In order to keep her creative side and her love for Allah alive, she visits Master Ibrahim during her free time and helps him fix Qurans in his shop.  She treats Master Ibrahim as her teacher, following his teachings and learning about religion from him while working.  He often tells Momina stories about his pious, kind-hearted wife, Husna, who changed his life for the better.  Momina\u2019s family lives in a small neighborhood as tenants and finances are tight.  However, Jahangir keeps the family\u2019s spirits up with his light-hearted humor and loving nature.  Jahangir desperately needs a kidney transplant and Momina owes many people money, so she is encouraged by Dawood to audition for Qalb E Momin\u2019s latest film, \u201cSanam.\u201d  Momina is optimistic that she can get a small role in the film, which will pay much more than the small roles in dramas she has been doing.  She gets to the audition and begins looking over a file of bills, quietly making calculations.  A girl next to her commends her on her dedication on learning her lines and Momina realizes that\u2019s what she\u2019s supposed to be doing.  She also realizes she\u2019s the only girl In shalwar kameez at the audition and becomes self-conscious, but continues rehearsing.  Once in the audition room, she meets Momin and the two exchange pleasantries before Momina starts her audition.  During the audition, Momina is nervous and plays with her dupatta \u2013 which Momin notices.  He angrily instructs her to throw off her dupatta, to which Momina tells him she will not and she will stop touching it.  Momin pushes further, telling her that women in his films do not wear dupattas anyway, so why can\u2019t she take it off now?  The two end up in a heated fight and Momin verbally thrashes Dawood for recommending her and tells his guards to throw her out.  Momina angrily leaves on her own and says she will never hate anyone as much as she hates Qalb E Momin. \nAqsa and Dawood find out about a Hollywood film casting call taking place in Lahore and cover her travel expenses to get her there.  The role was initially supposed to be played by Vidya Balan, but due to visa issues, she was unable to take the role and it was now going to be filled by a Pakistani actress.  Momina\u2019s first experience with travel, she is uncomfortable but manages her way there.  Once in Lahore, she feels disconnected with the entire process and sleepwalks her way through the audition.  She is shuffled from one section to another, asked to perform several times before finally being told that she got the part.  Given the signing amount, Momina cannot believe her eyes and begins crying with happiness, relieved that she will be able to pay for Jahangir\u2019s kidney transplant with this money. \nElated, Momina arrives at the airport to be greeted by a somber Aqsa and Dawood.  They take her straight to the mortuary, where he is told that Jahangir passed away.  Just like that, the floor falls beneath her and she feels as though it all was for nothing.  The family is informed that they will not release Jahangir\u2019s body until the payment has been fulfilled.  Momina spends the next night in turmoil, compiling a list of everyone she knows in the industry and outside of it, borrowing small amounts from everyone.  Letting go of her ego, she visits Momin and asks for forgiveness, hoping he would take her in his film or at least loan her an amount of money.  He rudely asks her to get out and treats her with disdain.  Momina is filled with rage in her heart towards Momin, but does not have time to feel humiliation, only wanting to collect money to release her brother\u2019s body.  At daybreak, Aqsa and Dawood help the family count the money and are relieved when they have enough to cover the bills.  Momina collapses from exhaustion, tired from the night of groveling for money.  Days pass, Jaangir buried, but Momina feels a lack of will to do anything.  Aqsa gently reminds her that she still has to work on the Hollywood film.  Momina pays a visit to Master Ibrahim who is shocked to hear about Jahangir.  Momina cries her sorrows out to him, crying for the first time, as he consoles her.  He tells her that Allah belongs to everyone as Momina angrily declares that Allah belongs to everyone, but Momina doesn\u2019t belong to him.  Momina\u2019s dilemma is felt here, caught now in a profession that she never wanted for herself and only took on for the sake of her brother. \nSultan and Suraiyya are on the same page as well and Momina arrives home one day to find Faisal at the house.  Suraiyya happily entertains him as Momina looks on in confusion and discomfort.  Does her life have room for love anymore?  Does she want Faisal?  After briefly offering his condolences and talking to Momina, Faisal tells Suraiyya that he will come with his mother next time.  Suraiyya tells Momina that Faisal\u2019s engagement has broken off and Faisal wants to marry her.  Momina protests, talking about her work and Suraiyya says she was only doing it for Jahangir and when Jahangir is no longer around, she should get married and live a happy life.  When Faisal arrives with his mother, everything feels like a dream to Momina.  While Faisal\u2019s mother seems less than pleased about Momina\u2019s background and stint in films, she seems all too happy to marry Faisal off to the girl of his choice \u2013 even if it\u2019s Momina.  Sultan and Suraiyya happily begin making plans for Momina\u2019s marriage.  Days later, Faisal takes Momina out for lunch where they have a very heavy conversation.  Faisal begins talking about their life after marriage and Momina delicately treads on the subject of her Hollywood film \u2013 Faisal seems surprised and seriously informs Momina that Sultan and Suraiyya told him that she was leaving films.  Momina, surprised, presses for more information.  Faisal makes it clear that his family is not on board with film families and frown upon anyone working in the industry.  He informs her that Sultan and Suraiyya have promised to stop working in films as well.  Momina is horrified by this and asks how her parents would make a living without their work?  Faisal replies that they are his responsibility and he will provide for them.  Momina continues to press on the subject of her work, stating that she needs to do the Hollywood film to pay off her debts.  Faisal says he will pay them, but Momina argues that it\u2019s her responsibility. Finally Faisal agrees, but says she can continue working in dramas, but not films, as films objectify women and he does not want his wife to be seen that way.  Momina internally knows that this relationship is over.  Faisal is trying to whitewash her family as though they are all dirty and need to be covered up.  She feels ashamed of her profession and herself and resents Faisal for making her feel this way.  The two finish their lunch, talking about happier subjects, but Momina knows it\u2019s over.\nNow in Hollywood, Momina is busy with her projects.  While finishing up her first film, she is signed on for a broadway play as well as another South Asian Hollywood venture.  Momina works hard, keeping herself busy to keep her mind busy.  She is tired, but neither she nor her family long for money anymore.  She\u2019s now a star and a personality of pride back in Pakistan.  Shortly after her first film releases, it flops \u2013 but Momina goes on to win an Oscar for her role.\n*****\nAbdul Aala continues to regret his behavior towards Husn E Jahaan.  His life burdened by the loss of his beloved son Taaha, Abdul Aala blames himself for Taaha\u2019s end as well as Husn E Jahaan\u2019s pain.  Constantly wondering why he couldn\u2019t just accept Husn E Jahaan and soften his attitude towards Tahaa, he imagines how life would be with him living with his son, daughter-in-law and grandson all together \u2013 if only he had reacted differently.  Abdul Aala continues to live his private life in Turkey, visiting Pakistan to see Momin every so often.  He deeply loves his grandson and wishes to see him on the right path, but his experience with Taaha has changed him.  He does not want to push Momin away and so, he has always allowed Momin to do as he likes \u2013 whether it be boarding school, film school, moving back to Pakistan, Abdul Aala has silently supported it all. \nAbdul Aala visits Momin in Pakistan.  During his time in Pakistan, he always visits two people.  First is, of course, Momin and the second being his friend Master Ibrahim.  Visiting him, he speaks of his grandson Momin and the two men share stories about their families.  Visiting Master Ibrahim is an essential part of Abdul Aala\u2019s visits to Pakistan. While Abdul Aala\u2019s trip goes well, he is praying in his room for Momin one night, asking Allah to guide Momin onto the right path \u2013 Momin overhears this and becomes upset.  He asks his grandfather why he believes his concept of religion is right?  What is wrong with Momin\u2019s life?  Angry, Momin is unable to understand his grandfather\u2019s point of view and Abdul Aala is unable to explain himself in a way for Momin to understand.  Abdul Aala leaves the next day quietly without informing Momin, leaving Momin upset and thinking. \nThe next day, Momin arrives at his office with a new idea.  He wants to make a film on spirituality \u2013 \u201croohaniyat.\u201d  Leaving his office perplexed, Momin is armed with simply this idea and no direction.  The press scoffs at him while his writers are left confused.  While working on \u201cSanam,\u201d, Momin continues to work on his film on spirituality.  His actors have slowly started bowing out, sponsors wanting to work on \u201cSanam,\u201d but not this one and even the writers are frustrated.  Momin is in a bind and while on the phone with Abdul Aala, his grandfather picks up on Momin\u2019s anxiousness.  He gives Momin the number of an art curator in Pakistan and tells him that if he needs money for his film, he should contact this man.  He tells Momin that this man will buy the paintings Abdul Aala had made for Momin over the years.  Momin thanks his grandfather and hangs up the phone smirking, wondering if Abdul Aala understands the amount of money necessary to make a film.  What could he get for Abdul Aala\u2019s calligraphy?  Certainly not money of that kind. \nMomin visits Turkey for work and stops in to spend time with Abdul Aala.  The two share a heart-to-heart about Taaha and Husn E Jahaan.  Abdul Aala tells Momin that his mother was a pure, clearn-hearted soul and Momin scoffs at this, saying his mother was an actress, a woman without honor.  Abdul Aala chides him, telling him that her heart belonged to Allah, telling him she was a good person and it was his misfortune that he didn\u2019t recognize her in time.  Abdul Aala asks Momin if he ever knew what the two were fighting about when Taaha left?  Momin answers no, though he has flashes of the scene \u2013 Husn E Jahaan telling Momin to keep Sultan\u2019s visit a secret.  Husn E Jahaan taking paintings off the wall (including the dancing one Taaha had painted of her) saying they were getting old, Sultan visiting Husn E Jahaan from Pakistan, Taaha arriving home and then\u2026..leaving.  Abdul Aala tells Momin that if he doesn\u2019t remember, it\u2019s better to remember the good times. \nShortly afterwards, back in Pakistan, Momin receives terrible news.  Abdul Aala has passed away.  Momin goes back to Turkey, leaving everything on hold.  He attends the funeral and is in awe at Abdul Aala\u2019s send-off.  He has a state funeral, honored by the government.  It is only then that Momin understands the level of Abdul Aala\u2019s success.  He feels small.  Momin stays in Turkey for some time\u2026..\n*****\nMomina continues to work in international projects, not compromising her integrity and dignity though, working on her own terms.  A superstar, Momina is the flavor of the season.  Momina and her family move from their small rented home into a nice, posh apartment.  And while the lifestyle is an upgrade, Sultan and Suraiyya seem bored, sad.  They miss the business of small neighborhood living, the day to day activities and the neighbors.  With Momina constantly out and rarely home, Suraiyya feels lonely.  Momina asks Dawood to find a place in the old neighborhood, but he scoffs.  \u201cYou can\u2019t go back there!\u201d and Momina realizes she has arrived and there is no looking back.  Momina spends time alone in her room during her down-time, reading the Quran gifted to her by Master Ibrahim \u2013 a Quran with the work of Abdul Aala, a famous calligrapher from Turkey.  Momina quickly became a fan of his art and began googling images of his work. \nShelley has backed out of Alif as the lead actress.  Momin has been missing for some time and she has to give dates to someone else.  Tina and Dawood kick up their socks in the office, everything gathering dust and not having been paid in months.  Tina discusses looking for work elsewhere when suddenly a disheveled figure walks in \u2013 Qalb E Momin.  Walking to Dawood, he throws a script on his desk.  \u201cAlif \u2013 A story by Qalb E Momin\u201d it reads.  Read this, Momin says.  \u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been doing in Turkey?\u201d  Yes, Momin replies.  He tells Dawood and Tina to read the script and there will be a meeting over it tomorrow.  Tina tells Dawood to read it and fill her in tomorrow.  The next morning, when she walks in, Dawood looks bloodshot and forces Tina to read the script.  The two of them are blown away by this incredible story of an actress lured away by love.  In the meeting the next day, Dawood and Tina gently suggest to Momin that Momina Sultan would be perfect for this role.  Expecting Momin to react, they are surprised when Momin quietly asks \u201cBut will she do it?\u201d  Dawood happily takes the script over to Momina and encourages her to read it.  Momina declares that she will never work with Qalb E Momin, but Dawood tells her to just read the script. \nMomina spends all night reading the script and is floored.  She quietly walks over to Sultan and asks him to read the script.  After reading it, Sultan is shocked and immediately tells Momina not to work on this film.  \u201cI\u2019m the villain of this story!\u201d he exclaims.  Momina asks Sultan to tell her what happened, but when he refuses, she realizes Sultan is the villain and it is her form of payback to do the role.  She visits Momin for a narration and asks him if the film is based on Husn E Jahaan?  Momin looks at her in shock.  How does she know Husn E Jahaan?  He denies it, but Momina now knows the truth.  During the narration, they are interrupted by an art collector \u2013 the same art collector Abdul Aala told Momin to contact for financing \u201cAlif.\u201d  Momin excuses himself and meets with the collector.  Momina overhears this conversation and is taken aback.  Not only is Qalb E Momin the son of Husn E Jahaan, but Abdul Aala is his grandfather?  How could this be?  If that\u2019s the case, Abdul Aala is the man who turned Husn E Jahaan away?  Momina struggles to put the pieces of this story together.  Momin is deep in thought over selling his grandfather\u2019s paintings when Momina declares that her price for the film will be the 7 paintings Momin was trying to sell to the collector.  Momin looks at her in shock, but ultimately agrees. \nMomin wakes up the next day certain that he no longer wants to part with Abdul Aala\u2019s paintings.  The entire world is fighting for these paintings, but they were made with Abdul Aala\u2019s love \u2013 love for Momin.  How could he part with it?  He heads home, but is shocked to see that Dawood already picked up the paintings and has delivered them to Momina.\nMomina visits Master Ibrahim and gives him the 7 paintings.  Master Ibrahim looks at them and immediately states \u201cAre these Momin\u2019s?\u201d.  Momina is shocked and asks how he knew?  Master Ibrahim tells her that Abdul Aala often spoke of him \u2013 and that these paintings belonged to Momin and if she didn\u2019t give them back, they would find their way back to him anyway, because that is God\u2019s will.  Momina listens to her teacher and returns the paintings to Momin\u2019s home through her driver.\nMomin is shocked to see the paintings back in their place at home and his heart sinks \u2013 did Momina leave the film?  But he sees Momina at the shoot for the film and is relieved.  He thanks Momina for her kindness and asks her how much she would like to be paid.  She tells him a minimal amount and says she will only take it after the completion of the film. \n*****\nMomina confronts Sultan and tells him to tell her the truth, otherwise she will think he\u2019s guilty.  Sultan tells her about his connection to Husn e Jahaan and how he loved her.  She was the center of his universe \u2013 but she left him to be with Taaha.  Sultan always hated Taaha for this, but Husn E Jahaan always kept In touch with him, knowing he would never abandon her.  Sultan wrote to her faithfully, no matter where he moved, always wanting her to have his address. \nOne year, Husn E Jahaan wrote to Sultan, asking him to come visit her in Turkey.  Sultan went and showed up at the door.  Husn E Jahaan received him warmly with a hug and then went to get paintings.  Her son wanted for things and Taaha did not make much money.  They were not well-off and she needed money to care for her son, but didn\u2019t want to hurt her husband\u2019s ego.  She gave Sultan all the pictures Taaha had painted of her and told him to sell them in Pakistan and give her the money.  Taaha was not upset with Sultan visiting, rather he was upset that Husn E Jahaan sold the memories of their love, the artifacts that joined them together in their affection for each other, the beginning of their marriage.  He felt this was akin to betrayal, though Husn E Jahaan only wanted to help her son. \nSultan went to Pakistan and tried to sell the paintings, but no one would buy them, as Husn E Jahaan had been gone for a long time.  Finally, Sultan sold his own home and sent Husn E Jahaan the money, telling her it came from her paintings.  Later, when she came back to Pakistan, Mumtaz (her mother) tried to marry Husn E Jahaan off to an older man.  Sultan concocted a story about Husn e Jahaan\u2019s suicide by drowning in order to help her escape to Turkey.  \u201cYou see?\u201d  Sultan told Momina.  He explains that he didn\u2019t come between Taaha and Husn E Jahaan.  He wasn\u2019t the villain. \n*****\nHusn E Jahaan and Momin came back to Pakistan to live with Husn E Jahaan\u2019s family in her home.  They are immediately met with scorn and hatred, the family angry that Husn E Jahaan left them without thinking about their fate.  Now older, Husn E Jahaan has no ability to earn as a lead actress.  Still wanting the best for her son, Husn E Jahaan has a big birthday party for Momin and he enjoys himself, loving spending time with his mother and friends.  However the next day, he is shunned by his friends as their parents all realized his mother is Husn E Jahaan, the actress, a woman not meant to be respected.  A woman who sells her body and beauty for money.  Momin is shattered and begins to hate his mother.  Acting out, he tells her he hates her and asks to move back and live with his grandfather.  Husn E Jahaan sends Momin back to Turkey to live with Abdul Aala and Abdul Aala feels terribly for her. \n*****\nMomin and Momina continue to develop a soft spot for each other, oddly falling for each other despite their differences. Momin apologizes for his role in hurting her in the past and offers condolences for Jahangir.  Momin gives Momina two white roses every time he sees Momina, something Taaha would do for Husn E Jahaan. In a reading for the second half of the script, Momin begins prepping the actor who will be playing Sultan\u2019s role, the man \u201cAaliyah Jahaan\u201d had the affair with.  Momina questions why Husn E Jahaan would cheat the family she loved so?  Momin is taken aback.  Momina quietly tells him that maybe she was selling something and that\u2019s why she called Sultan over?  Maybe some paintings?  Momin stares at Momina in awe, wondering how she could know about the paintings?  He thinks back to Husn E Jahaan pulling the paintings off the wall \u2013 \u201cThese paintings have gotten old.\u201d  Confused, Momin begins to think.\nLater, Momin walks in on Dawood comforting Momina over some family troubles and misunderstands the situation.  He angrily accuses the two of having an affair and claims to be disapproving of office affairs to which Momina slaps him across the face.  This is the first time anyone has ever slapped Momin and he is shocked.  Dawood fills him in, clarifying the situation and Momin realizes how wrong he was \u2013 and how jealous. \nHe goes back to Momina\u2019s house to apologize and is greeted by Momina\u2019s mother.  The two bond when Momina walks in.  Her heart warms seeing him with her mother.  Momin apologizes to Momina and she accepts.  The two are about to declare\u2026.something to each other, but are interrupted by Sultan walking in.  Momin erupts in anger, immediately recognizing him.  Sultan finally has the chance to set things straight \u2013 he tells Momin everything, but most clearly, he tells Momin that Sultan isn\u2019t the villain of the story, rather Momin is the villain.  Momin is what came between Taaha and Husn E Jahaan.  The mother in Husn E Jahaan overtook the wife.  The wife never would have sold those paintings, but the mother did it for her child.  Sultan also points out that if he were a villain, he never would\u2019ve sold his own house to care for Husn E Jahaan and Momin.\nMomin walks out and spends the night crying.  He thinks about the misery he caused his mother, how he doubted her, how he mistreated her.  He is wrecked with guilt.  Momin thinks back to when he wrote a letter to Allah, asking for his mother to come back to him.  She finally did, but when she did, Abdul Aala told him not to go in front of her, because if she saw him, she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave with her new husband.  Momin\u2019s heart broke and he decided then that he would ever write to Allah ever again. \nSultan pulls out the letters Husn E Jahaan wrote to him over the years and tells Momina to give them to Momin.  Momina is embarrassed, but she takes the letters to Momin.  He confides in her, allowing her to see him break down and she consoles him, telling him it\u2019s not his fault.  Momina asks Momin what happened to Husn E Jahaan.  Momin tells her that she got married to a man named Ibrahim.  Momina thinks about the pictures, the dancing image of Husn E Jahaan and thinks back to when she sold the images to Master Ibrahim when Jahangir was sick.  He gave 1 lakh for those pictures \u2013 pictures that were not worth as much.  Momina suddenly sits up and tells Momin to read the letters.  She leaves and heads to Master Ibrahim\u2019s house and asks to hear about his wife, Husna.  Master Ibrahim looks at her and says \u201cEvery secret has a time to be revealed.\u201d  He tells her about his wife, Husna, the woman who was once Husn E Jahaan.  He tells her that he didn\u2019t know she was Abdul Aala\u2019s daughter in law nor did he know she had a son.  HE just knew he was married to a wonderful, religious, kind, pious woman.  He found out much later about her truth and it didn\u2019t make a difference.  Master Ibrahim discusses how Abdul Aala always came to see him when he was in Pakistan and they would discuss Momin.  Momina later takes Momin to meet Master Ibrahim, but when they arrive at his house, they are informed that he has passed away.  Momin is given the keys to his house and finds memories of his mother there. \n*****\nMomin alters his script.  \u201cAlif\u201d becomes the story of an actress to a mother, a woman of strength and dignity, a tribute to his mother.  The film is completed and released.  Momin and Momina anticipate the reception together.  Momin declares that if the film is a hit, he will stay, but if it flops, he will move back to Turkey and take over his grandfather\u2019s tradition of working as a calligrapher.  The movie is a success, a superhit and is hailed by all, but Momin still decides to leave.  Momina\u2019s heart stops in her throat and she sadly tells him that she always wishes the best for him.  He asks her to come with him.  Momina tells him that she doesn\u2019t want to become another Husn E Jahaan.  \u201cTum manzil tak pauhanch gaaye ho.

It showed how both come-across the same path and understand the terminology of the alphabet Alif illustrating the bond of an individual with his God.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story follows the lives of several characters, but the four main characters are Taaha, Husn E Jahaan, Qalb E Momin and Momina.  The story is told in flashbacks and moves from the past to the present as well as switching between Turkey and Pakistan.   It\u2019s hard to summarize, because much of the information is revealed at different points of time, but I will try!\nThe story opens with Qalb E Momin, a little boy who lives with his mother, Husn E Jahaan, in a little house in Turkey.  He writes letters to Allah daily where he asks for material things, because they are not well off.  But he also asks for his mother\u2019s happiness and wishes that Allah sends his father back so they can be a family again.  It\u2019s slowly revealed through these letters that Husn E Jahaan and Taaha are Momin\u2019s parents and they got into a fight which resulted in Taaha leaving the house \u2013 and did not return (time frame, roughly a year or more).  Husn E Jahaan continues to wait for him, sorry for her behavior and full of guilt.  Momin lovingly describes his mother as simple, but beautiful and complains that she used to dress up for her father, but no longer does.  One day after stumbling upon Momin\u2019s letters to Allah, Husn E Jahaan decides to write a letter of her own to Tahaa and sends it (along with all of Momin\u2019s letters) to the place she believes Taaha is \u2013 his father\u2019s home, Abdul Aala.  The two receive a letter back from Abdul Aala announcing his arrival.  Husn E Jahaan happily prepares for Taaha\u2019s return.\nOn the day, Abdul Aala arrives alone.  After talking, Husn E Jahaan and Abdul Aala realize that neither knows where Taaha is.  They weep and make up as Abdul Aala asks Husn E Jahaan for forgiveness and promises to find Taaha.  Time passes and it is discovered that Taaha passed away in a car accident.  Heart-broken, Husn E Jahaan and Momin move back to Pakistan. \n*****\nAbdul Aala is a world-famous calligrapher.  His art is housed in many museums and despite his fame and fortune, he lives a simple life in a small house in a small town in Turkey.  He devotes his life to Allah and works painting calligraphy dedicated to his Creator.  Raising his only son, Taaha, he teaches Taaha the family business as well and Taaha is also a successful calligrapher.  Taaha is also a whirling dervish and finds joy in performing at cultural events \u2013 something which Abdul Aala and Taaha clash on, as Abdul Aala believes he should only dance in private for Allah.  Taaha goes on to perform at a huge cultural event taking place with performers from all over the world.\nHusn E Jahaan is the queen of the Pakistani film industry.  A beauty with talent in acting and dancing, she works to support her family, but is not particularly happy doing so.  Accompanied by Sultan, her faithful assistant and makeup artist, she visits Turkey to perform at a cultural show.  It is here that she meets Taaha and everything changes for the two.  Sultan is devoted to Husn E Jahaan and he is painfully in love with her. \nTaaha falls in love with Husn E Jahaan at first sight and, for the first time in his life, Taaha paints a portrait of a woman.  He gifts the painting to Husn E Jahaan and she is taken.  Husn E Jahaan feels the pull towards Taaha, believing he is the vessel that will change her life and bring her closer to Allah.  She wants to be free of the world of entertainment, a world that thrives on cashing in on a woman\u2019s beauty and body.  She takes great pains in finding something appropriate to wear when going to meet Abdul Aala, driving Sultan crazy by making him find modest clothing, but when she is unsuccessful, she decides to take a white bedsheet and wears it around herself.  This is the extent to which Husn E Jahaan wanted to cleanse her image and her soul.  However, Abdul Aala rejects Husn E Jahaan outright.  While he is a kind soul devoted to his Creator, Abdul Aala is consumed with judgement for Husn E Jahaan, because not only does he believe she\u2019s in an unacceptable profession, but also because he is so hurt that his son has been so badly distracted from religion.  He is furious that in his family lineage of calligraphers, Taaha is the first to have ever painted the portrait of a dancing woman and he believes that shaitaan is dragging Taaha away from Allah.  Abdul Aala\u2019s rejection of Husn E Jahaan causes Taaha to leave home and the two begin their life together without Abdul Aala\u2019s blessings. \nThis rejection of his father\u2019s causes Taaha severe emotional turmoil.  While the two lovebirds are devoted to each other and go on to have a son, their relationship does suffer due to their individual suffering.  While Taaha mourns the loss of his father, he also finds that without his father\u2019s blessings, he can no longer paint and do calligraphy with the perfection he once did.  His paintings now seem \u201cordinary\u201d and he struggles to find buyers \u2013 which means he is unable to earn money.  He cries and curses himself, feeling as though Allah is punishing him.  Watching Taaha in pain also causes Husn E Jahaan pain on a different level.  She feels angry that Abdul Aala did not accept her and has pushed the couple into this position.  She also feels rejection, on a level, from Taaha and feels guilt for doing this to him.  Amidst it all, the two have their son, Qalb E Momin, and they are a close-knit family until one day, Husn E Jahaan and Taaha have a fight and Taaha is never seen again.\n ******\nSwitching to present day, Qalb E Momin is the most popular film director in Pakistan.  An arrogant man, Qalb E Momin knows that anything he touches turns to gold.  He is called the hit-maker and actors and actresses know that if they work in one of his films, even in a side role, they will have a solid career ahead of them in films and television.  Momin is known for objectifying women in his films and the world knows his films run on item numbers and revealing clothing on his actresses.  He does not respect women in this industry.  Set to make his fourth film, \u201cSanam,\u201d he begins casting.  His does have a girlfriend, Neha, who works as a costume designer in his films and proposes to her.  The couple initially seems very happy, but such is the nature of Momin that he cannot forgive, and Neha makes a critical error.  Abdul Aala visits Momin in the middle of a party and is taken aback by Momin\u2019s lifestyle.  While Momin does not hide it from him, Momin has always felt embarrassed to have Abdul Aala see this side of his.  Each year on Momin\u2019s birthday, Abdul Aala gives Momin a piece of his calligraphy which he makes specifically for Momin in an attempt to keep him on the right path.  The two men have very different ideas on right and wrong, Momin feeling Abdul Aala judges his profession and Abdul Aala only wishing to bring his grandson back to religion.  Abdul Aala meets Neha who excitedly begins telling him about Momin\u2019s films and success, which only makes Momin feel worse.  Abdul Aala and Momin have an argument over religion, a common occurrence between the two and Abdul Aala leaves for Turkey shortly afterwards. \nNeha begins pushing Momin to cast her \u201cbest friend,\u201d Zulfi (???), a model who Momin has never met.  Neha\u2019s keen interest in Zulfi turns Momin off and he begins to get upset.  As time goes on, Neha continues to push Momin to cast Zulfi in the lead role and the situation gets intense enough where Neha, certain of her place in Momin\u2019s life, threatens him:  \u201cHire Zulfi as your lead or you will lose me.\u201d  This angers Momin and he cuts off from Neha.  On the announcement launch of his film, he has Zulfi and Neha personally invited and Neha, unaware of Momin\u2019s anger, is elated.  She thinks \u201cI knew he loved me enough to do this for me.\u201d  Unfortunately, she is in for a rude shock when Momin has them both seated in the front row and then not only announces a different male actor (Abbas) for his film, but also has Neha replaced as the costume designer, casting her mortal enemy in her place.  Neha realizes that her relationship with Momin is over and she visits his apartment, throwing his ring back at him and vows to ruin his career.\nMomina Sultan Is a small-time drama actress.  She works in side roles, usually playing the friend of the lead actress.  Despite being highly talented, Momina does not have a strong body of work behind her and is usually overlooked by casting directors for bigger roles.  Her friends Aqsa and Dawood have successful behind-the-scenes positions in the industry and work to help her find roles to keep her household afloat.  Momina\u2019s father, Sultan, worked as a makeup artist and told tales of superstar Husn E Jahaan all day long, devoted to his favorite actress.  \u201cWhat happened to Husn E Jahaan?\u201d Momina would ask.  \u201cShe committed suicide,\u201d Sultan would answer.  Suraiyya, Momina\u2019s mother, worked as a small time singer in the industry.  Jahangir was a successful child star and the apple of their parents eyes.  Everyone expected Jahangir to go on to be a film superstar, but before that dream could come true, he fell ill.  Momina was in art school and was a very dedicated student with a lot of talent.  She was involved with Faisal and the two had plans of getting married.  However, everything changed once Jahangir got sick.  Critically ill, Jahangir needs a kidney transplant.  This forced Momina to quit school and become a \u201cson\u201d for her family.  Faisal went on to get engaged to someone else while Momina moved into the entertainment industry, picking up roles to keep her family going and her brother alive.  The industry was never the goal for Momina, as she was deeply conservative at heart and felt the pull towards God.  In her head, she always felt as though she was doing something wrong.  She does not respect the industry she is in and feels as though her life is a burden.  In order to keep her creative side and her love for Allah alive, she visits Master Ibrahim during her free time and helps him fix Qurans in his shop.  She treats Master Ibrahim as her teacher, following his teachings and learning about religion from him while working.  He often tells Momina stories about his pious, kind-hearted wife, Husna, who changed his life for the better.  Momina\u2019s family lives in a small neighborhood as tenants and finances are tight.  However, Jahangir keeps the family\u2019s spirits up with his light-hearted humor and loving nature.  Jahangir desperately needs a kidney transplant and Momina owes many people money, so she is encouraged by Dawood to audition for Qalb E Momin\u2019s latest film, \u201cSanam.\u201d  Momina is optimistic that she can get a small role in the film, which will pay much more than the small roles in dramas she has been doing.  She gets to the audition and begins looking over a file of bills, quietly making calculations.  A girl next to her commends her on her dedication on learning her lines and Momina realizes that\u2019s what she\u2019s supposed to be doing.  She also realizes she\u2019s the only girl In shalwar kameez at the audition and becomes self-conscious, but continues rehearsing.  Once in the audition room, she meets Momin and the two exchange pleasantries before Momina starts her audition.  During the audition, Momina is nervous and plays with her dupatta \u2013 which Momin notices.  He angrily instructs her to throw off her dupatta, to which Momina tells him she will not and she will stop touching it.  Momin pushes further, telling her that women in his films do not wear dupattas anyway, so why can\u2019t she take it off now?  The two end up in a heated fight and Momin verbally thrashes Dawood for recommending her and tells his guards to throw her out.  Momina angrily leaves on her own and says she will never hate anyone as much as she hates Qalb E Momin. \nAqsa and Dawood find out about a Hollywood film casting call taking place in Lahore and cover her travel expenses to get her there.  The role was initially supposed to be played by Vidya Balan, but due to visa issues, she was unable to take the role and it was now going to be filled by a Pakistani actress.  Momina\u2019s first experience with travel, she is uncomfortable but manages her way there.  Once in Lahore, she feels disconnected with the entire process and sleepwalks her way through the audition.  She is shuffled from one section to another, asked to perform several times before finally being told that she got the part.  Given the signing amount, Momina cannot believe her eyes and begins crying with happiness, relieved that she will be able to pay for Jahangir\u2019s kidney transplant with this money. \nElated, Momina arrives at the airport to be greeted by a somber Aqsa and Dawood.  They take her straight to the mortuary, where he is told that Jahangir passed away.  Just like that, the floor falls beneath her and she feels as though it all was for nothing.  The family is informed that they will not release Jahangir\u2019s body until the payment has been fulfilled.  Momina spends the next night in turmoil, compiling a list of everyone she knows in the industry and outside of it, borrowing small amounts from everyone.  Letting go of her ego, she visits Momin and asks for forgiveness, hoping he would take her in his film or at least loan her an amount of money.  He rudely asks her to get out and treats her with disdain.  Momina is filled with rage in her heart towards Momin, but does not have time to feel humiliation, only wanting to collect money to release her brother\u2019s body.  At daybreak, Aqsa and Dawood help the family count the money and are relieved when they have enough to cover the bills.  Momina collapses from exhaustion, tired from the night of groveling for money.  Days pass, Jaangir buried, but Momina feels a lack of will to do anything.  Aqsa gently reminds her that she still has to work on the Hollywood film.  Momina pays a visit to Master Ibrahim who is shocked to hear about Jahangir.  Momina cries her sorrows out to him, crying for the first time, as he consoles her.  He tells her that Allah belongs to everyone as Momina angrily declares that Allah belongs to everyone, but Momina doesn\u2019t belong to him.  Momina\u2019s dilemma is felt here, caught now in a profession that she never wanted for herself and only took on for the sake of her brother. \nSultan and Suraiyya are on the same page as well and Momina arrives home one day to find Faisal at the house.  Suraiyya happily entertains him as Momina looks on in confusion and discomfort.  Does her life have room for love anymore?  Does she want Faisal?  After briefly offering his condolences and talking to Momina, Faisal tells Suraiyya that he will come with his mother next time.  Suraiyya tells Momina that Faisal\u2019s engagement has broken off and Faisal wants to marry her.  Momina protests, talking about her work and Suraiyya says she was only doing it for Jahangir and when Jahangir is no longer around, she should get married and live a happy life.  When Faisal arrives with his mother, everything feels like a dream to Momina.  While Faisal\u2019s mother seems less than pleased about Momina\u2019s background and stint in films, she seems all too happy to marry Faisal off to the girl of his choice \u2013 even if it\u2019s Momina.  Sultan and Suraiyya happily begin making plans for Momina\u2019s marriage.  Days later, Faisal takes Momina out for lunch where they have a very heavy conversation.  Faisal begins talking about their life after marriage and Momina delicately treads on the subject of her Hollywood film \u2013 Faisal seems surprised and seriously informs Momina that Sultan and Suraiyya told him that she was leaving films.  Momina, surprised, presses for more information.  Faisal makes it clear that his family is not on board with film families and frown upon anyone working in the industry.  He informs her that Sultan and Suraiyya have promised to stop working in films as well.  Momina is horrified by this and asks how her parents would make a living without their work?  Faisal replies that they are his responsibility and he will provide for them.  Momina continues to press on the subject of her work, stating that she needs to do the Hollywood film to pay off her debts.  Faisal says he will pay them, but Momina argues that it\u2019s her responsibility. Finally Faisal agrees, but says she can continue working in dramas, but not films, as films objectify women and he does not want his wife to be seen that way.  Momina internally knows that this relationship is over.  Faisal is trying to whitewash her family as though they are all dirty and need to be covered up.  She feels ashamed of her profession and herself and resents Faisal for making her feel this way.  The two finish their lunch, talking about happier subjects, but Momina knows it\u2019s over.\nNow in Hollywood, Momina is busy with her projects.  While finishing up her first film, she is signed on for a broadway play as well as another South Asian Hollywood venture.  Momina works hard, keeping herself busy to keep her mind busy.  She is tired, but neither she nor her family long for money anymore.  She\u2019s now a star and a personality of pride back in Pakistan.  Shortly after her first film releases, it flops \u2013 but Momina goes on to win an Oscar for her role.\n*****\nAbdul Aala continues to regret his behavior towards Husn E Jahaan.  His life burdened by the loss of his beloved son Taaha, Abdul Aala blames himself for Taaha\u2019s end as well as Husn E Jahaan\u2019s pain.  Constantly wondering why he couldn\u2019t just accept Husn E Jahaan and soften his attitude towards Tahaa, he imagines how life would be with him living with his son, daughter-in-law and grandson all together \u2013 if only he had reacted differently.  Abdul Aala continues to live his private life in Turkey, visiting Pakistan to see Momin every so often.  He deeply loves his grandson and wishes to see him on the right path, but his experience with Taaha has changed him.  He does not want to push Momin away and so, he has always allowed Momin to do as he likes \u2013 whether it be boarding school, film school, moving back to Pakistan, Abdul Aala has silently supported it all. \nAbdul Aala visits Momin in Pakistan.  During his time in Pakistan, he always visits two people.  First is, of course, Momin and the second being his friend Master Ibrahim.  Visiting him, he speaks of his grandson Momin and the two men share stories about their families.  Visiting Master Ibrahim is an essential part of Abdul Aala\u2019s visits to Pakistan. While Abdul Aala\u2019s trip goes well, he is praying in his room for Momin one night, asking Allah to guide Momin onto the right path \u2013 Momin overhears this and becomes upset.  He asks his grandfather why he believes his concept of religion is right?  What is wrong with Momin\u2019s life?  Angry, Momin is unable to understand his grandfather\u2019s point of view and Abdul Aala is unable to explain himself in a way for Momin to understand.  Abdul Aala leaves the next day quietly without informing Momin, leaving Momin upset and thinking. \nThe next day, Momin arrives at his office with a new idea.  He wants to make a film on spirituality \u2013 \u201croohaniyat.\u201d  Leaving his office perplexed, Momin is armed with simply this idea and no direction.  The press scoffs at him while his writers are left confused.  While working on \u201cSanam,\u201d, Momin continues to work on his film on spirituality.  His actors have slowly started bowing out, sponsors wanting to work on \u201cSanam,\u201d but not this one and even the writers are frustrated.  Momin is in a bind and while on the phone with Abdul Aala, his grandfather picks up on Momin\u2019s anxiousness.  He gives Momin the number of an art curator in Pakistan and tells him that if he needs money for his film, he should contact this man.  He tells Momin that this man will buy the paintings Abdul Aala had made for Momin over the years.  Momin thanks his grandfather and hangs up the phone smirking, wondering if Abdul Aala understands the amount of money necessary to make a film.  What could he get for Abdul Aala\u2019s calligraphy?  Certainly not money of that kind. \nMomin visits Turkey for work and stops in to spend time with Abdul Aala.  The two share a heart-to-heart about Taaha and Husn E Jahaan.  Abdul Aala tells Momin that his mother was a pure, clearn-hearted soul and Momin scoffs at this, saying his mother was an actress, a woman without honor.  Abdul Aala chides him, telling him that her heart belonged to Allah, telling him she was a good person and it was his misfortune that he didn\u2019t recognize her in time.  Abdul Aala asks Momin if he ever knew what the two were fighting about when Taaha left?  Momin answers no, though he has flashes of the scene \u2013 Husn E Jahaan telling Momin to keep Sultan\u2019s visit a secret.  Husn E Jahaan taking paintings off the wall (including the dancing one Taaha had painted of her) saying they were getting old, Sultan visiting Husn E Jahaan from Pakistan, Taaha arriving home and then\u2026..leaving.  Abdul Aala tells Momin that if he doesn\u2019t remember, it\u2019s better to remember the good times. \nShortly afterwards, back in Pakistan, Momin receives terrible news.  Abdul Aala has passed away.  Momin goes back to Turkey, leaving everything on hold.  He attends the funeral and is in awe at Abdul Aala\u2019s send-off.  He has a state funeral, honored by the government.  It is only then that Momin understands the level of Abdul Aala\u2019s success.  He feels small.  Momin stays in Turkey for some time\u2026..\n*****\nMomina continues to work in international projects, not compromising her integrity and dignity though, working on her own terms.  A superstar, Momina is the flavor of the season.  Momina and her family move from their small rented home into a nice, posh apartment.  And while the lifestyle is an upgrade, Sultan and Suraiyya seem bored, sad.  They miss the business of small neighborhood living, the day to day activities and the neighbors.  With Momina constantly out and rarely home, Suraiyya feels lonely.  Momina asks Dawood to find a place in the old neighborhood, but he scoffs.  \u201cYou can\u2019t go back there!\u201d and Momina realizes she has arrived and there is no looking back.  Momina spends time alone in her room during her down-time, reading the Quran gifted to her by Master Ibrahim \u2013 a Quran with the work of Abdul Aala, a famous calligrapher from Turkey.  Momina quickly became a fan of his art and began googling images of his work. \nShelley has backed out of Alif as the lead actress.  Momin has been missing for some time and she has to give dates to someone else.  Tina and Dawood kick up their socks in the office, everything gathering dust and not having been paid in months.  Tina discusses looking for work elsewhere when suddenly a disheveled figure walks in \u2013 Qalb E Momin.  Walking to Dawood, he throws a script on his desk.  \u201cAlif \u2013 A story by Qalb E Momin\u201d it reads.  Read this, Momin says.  \u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been doing in Turkey?\u201d  Yes, Momin replies.  He tells Dawood and Tina to read the script and there will be a meeting over it tomorrow.  Tina tells Dawood to read it and fill her in tomorrow.  The next morning, when she walks in, Dawood looks bloodshot and forces Tina to read the script.  The two of them are blown away by this incredible story of an actress lured away by love.  In the meeting the next day, Dawood and Tina gently suggest to Momin that Momina Sultan would be perfect for this role.  Expecting Momin to react, they are surprised when Momin quietly asks \u201cBut will she do it?\u201d  Dawood happily takes the script over to Momina and encourages her to read it.  Momina declares that she will never work with Qalb E Momin, but Dawood tells her to just read the script. \nMomina spends all night reading the script and is floored.  She quietly walks over to Sultan and asks him to read the script.  After reading it, Sultan is shocked and immediately tells Momina not to work on this film.  \u201cI\u2019m the villain of this story!\u201d he exclaims.  Momina asks Sultan to tell her what happened, but when he refuses, she realizes Sultan is the villain and it is her form of payback to do the role.  She visits Momin for a narration and asks him if the film is based on Husn E Jahaan?  Momin looks at her in shock.  How does she know Husn E Jahaan?  He denies it, but Momina now knows the truth.  During the narration, they are interrupted by an art collector \u2013 the same art collector Abdul Aala told Momin to contact for financing \u201cAlif.\u201d  Momin excuses himself and meets with the collector.  Momina overhears this conversation and is taken aback.  Not only is Qalb E Momin the son of Husn E Jahaan, but Abdul Aala is his grandfather?  How could this be?  If that\u2019s the case, Abdul Aala is the man who turned Husn E Jahaan away?  Momina struggles to put the pieces of this story together.  Momin is deep in thought over selling his grandfather\u2019s paintings when Momina declares that her price for the film will be the 7 paintings Momin was trying to sell to the collector.  Momin looks at her in shock, but ultimately agrees. \nMomin wakes up the next day certain that he no longer wants to part with Abdul Aala\u2019s paintings.  The entire world is fighting for these paintings, but they were made with Abdul Aala\u2019s love \u2013 love for Momin.  How could he part with it?  He heads home, but is shocked to see that Dawood already picked up the paintings and has delivered them to Momina.\nMomina visits Master Ibrahim and gives him the 7 paintings.  Master Ibrahim looks at them and immediately states \u201cAre these Momin\u2019s?\u201d.  Momina is shocked and asks how he knew?  Master Ibrahim tells her that Abdul Aala often spoke of him \u2013 and that these paintings belonged to Momin and if she didn\u2019t give them back, they would find their way back to him anyway, because that is God\u2019s will.  Momina listens to her teacher and returns the paintings to Momin\u2019s home through her driver.\nMomin is shocked to see the paintings back in their place at home and his heart sinks \u2013 did Momina leave the film?  But he sees Momina at the shoot for the film and is relieved.  He thanks Momina for her kindness and asks her how much she would like to be paid.  She tells him a minimal amount and says she will only take it after the completion of the film. \n*****\nMomina confronts Sultan and tells him to tell her the truth, otherwise she will think he\u2019s guilty.  Sultan tells her about his connection to Husn e Jahaan and how he loved her.  She was the center of his universe \u2013 but she left him to be with Taaha.  Sultan always hated Taaha for this, but Husn E Jahaan always kept In touch with him, knowing he would never abandon her.  Sultan wrote to her faithfully, no matter where he moved, always wanting her to have his address. \nOne year, Husn E Jahaan wrote to Sultan, asking him to come visit her in Turkey.  Sultan went and showed up at the door.  Husn E Jahaan received him warmly with a hug and then went to get paintings.  Her son wanted for things and Taaha did not make much money.  They were not well-off and she needed money to care for her son, but didn\u2019t want to hurt her husband\u2019s ego.  She gave Sultan all the pictures Taaha had painted of her and told him to sell them in Pakistan and give her the money.  Taaha was not upset with Sultan visiting, rather he was upset that Husn E Jahaan sold the memories of their love, the artifacts that joined them together in their affection for each other, the beginning of their marriage.  He felt this was akin to betrayal, though Husn E Jahaan only wanted to help her son. \nSultan went to Pakistan and tried to sell the paintings, but no one would buy them, as Husn E Jahaan had been gone for a long time.  Finally, Sultan sold his own home and sent Husn E Jahaan the money, telling her it came from her paintings.  Later, when she came back to Pakistan, Mumtaz (her mother) tried to marry Husn E Jahaan off to an older man.  Sultan concocted a story about Husn e Jahaan\u2019s suicide by drowning in order to help her escape to Turkey.  \u201cYou see?\u201d  Sultan told Momina.  He explains that he didn\u2019t come between Taaha and Husn E Jahaan.  He wasn\u2019t the villain. \n*****\nHusn E Jahaan and Momin came back to Pakistan to live with Husn E Jahaan\u2019s family in her home.  They are immediately met with scorn and hatred, the family angry that Husn E Jahaan left them without thinking about their fate.  Now older, Husn E Jahaan has no ability to earn as a lead actress.  Still wanting the best for her son, Husn E Jahaan has a big birthday party for Momin and he enjoys himself, loving spending time with his mother and friends.  However the next day, he is shunned by his friends as their parents all realized his mother is Husn E Jahaan, the actress, a woman not meant to be respected.  A woman who sells her body and beauty for money.  Momin is shattered and begins to hate his mother.  Acting out, he tells her he hates her and asks to move back and live with his grandfather.  Husn E Jahaan sends Momin back to Turkey to live with Abdul Aala and Abdul Aala feels terribly for her. \n*****\nMomin and Momina continue to develop a soft spot for each other, oddly falling for each other despite their differences. Momin apologizes for his role in hurting her in the past and offers condolences for Jahangir.  Momin gives Momina two white roses every time he sees Momina, something Taaha would do for Husn E Jahaan. In a reading for the second half of the script, Momin begins prepping the actor who will be playing Sultan\u2019s role, the man \u201cAaliyah Jahaan\u201d had the affair with.  Momina questions why Husn E Jahaan would cheat the family she loved so?  Momin is taken aback.  Momina quietly tells him that maybe she was selling something and that\u2019s why she called Sultan over?  Maybe some paintings?  Momin stares at Momina in awe, wondering how she could know about the paintings?  He thinks back to Husn E Jahaan pulling the paintings off the wall \u2013 \u201cThese paintings have gotten old.\u201d  Confused, Momin begins to think.\nLater, Momin walks in on Dawood comforting Momina over some family troubles and misunderstands the situation.  He angrily accuses the two of having an affair and claims to be disapproving of office affairs to which Momina slaps him across the face.  This is the first time anyone has ever slapped Momin and he is shocked.  Dawood fills him in, clarifying the situation and Momin realizes how wrong he was \u2013 and how jealous. \nHe goes back to Momina\u2019s house to apologize and is greeted by Momina\u2019s mother.  The two bond when Momina walks in.  Her heart warms seeing him with her mother.  Momin apologizes to Momina and she accepts.  The two are about to declare\u2026.something to each other, but are interrupted by Sultan walking in.  Momin erupts in anger, immediately recognizing him.  Sultan finally has the chance to set things straight \u2013 he tells Momin everything, but most clearly, he tells Momin that Sultan isn\u2019t the villain of the story, rather Momin is the villain.  Momin is what came between Taaha and Husn E Jahaan.  The mother in Husn E Jahaan overtook the wife.  The wife never would have sold those paintings, but the mother did it for her child.  Sultan also points out that if he were a villain, he never would\u2019ve sold his own house to care for Husn E Jahaan and Momin.\nMomin walks out and spends the night crying.  He thinks about the misery he caused his mother, how he doubted her, how he mistreated her.  He is wrecked with guilt.  Momin thinks back to when he wrote a letter to Allah, asking for his mother to come back to him.  She finally did, but when she did, Abdul Aala told him not to go in front of her, because if she saw him, she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave with her new husband.  Momin\u2019s heart broke and he decided then that he would ever write to Allah ever again. \nSultan pulls out the letters Husn E Jahaan wrote to him over the years and tells Momina to give them to Momin.  Momina is embarrassed, but she takes the letters to Momin.  He confides in her, allowing her to see him break down and she consoles him, telling him it\u2019s not his fault.  Momina asks Momin what happened to Husn E Jahaan.  Momin tells her that she got married to a man named Ibrahim.  Momina thinks about the pictures, the dancing image of Husn E Jahaan and thinks back to when she sold the images to Master Ibrahim when Jahangir was sick.  He gave 1 lakh for those pictures \u2013 pictures that were not worth as much.  Momina suddenly sits up and tells Momin to read the letters.  She leaves and heads to Master Ibrahim\u2019s house and asks to hear about his wife, Husna.  Master Ibrahim looks at her and says \u201cEvery secret has a time to be revealed.\u201d  He tells her about his wife, Husna, the woman who was once Husn E Jahaan.  He tells her that he didn\u2019t know she was Abdul Aala\u2019s daughter in law nor did he know she had a son.  HE just knew he was married to a wonderful, religious, kind, pious woman.  He found out much later about her truth and it didn\u2019t make a difference.  Master Ibrahim discusses how Abdul Aala always came to see him when he was in Pakistan and they would discuss Momin.  Momina later takes Momin to meet Master Ibrahim, but when they arrive at his house, they are informed that he has passed away.  Momin is given the keys to his house and finds memories of his mother there. \n*****\nMomin alters his script.  \u201cAlif\u201d becomes the story of an actress to a mother, a woman of strength and dignity, a tribute to his mother.  The film is completed and released.  Momin and Momina anticipate the reception together.  Momin declares that if the film is a hit, he will stay, but if it flops, he will move back to Turkey and take over his grandfather\u2019s tradition of working as a calligrapher.  The movie is a success, a superhit and is hailed by all, but Momin still decides to leave.  Momina\u2019s heart stops in her throat and she sadly tells him that she always wishes the best for him.  He asks her to come with him.  Momina tells him that she doesn\u2019t want to become another Husn E Jahaan.  \u201cTum manzil tak pauhanch gaaye ho.  Main raaste mein hoon\u201d (You\u2019ve already reached the destination, I\u2019m still on my way).  Momin tells her that he will wait for her and the two embrace.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Hamza Ali Abbasi]] as Qalb-E-Momin<ref name=\"Alifcast\">{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1721683/4-hamza-ali-abbasi-sajal-aly-kubra-khan-star-alif/|title=Hamza Ali Abbasi, Sajal Aly and Kubra Khan to star in 'Alif' {{!}} The Express Tribune|date=May 29, 2018|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* [[Manzar_Sehbai|Manzar Sehbai]] as Abdul Alaa (Dada Jaan)\n* [[Sajal Aly]] as Momina Sultan\n* [[Kubra Khan]] as Husn-E-Jahan\n* [[Ahsan_Khan|Ahsan Khan]] ..
