Grant]], 18th [[President of the United States]], and his wife, [[Julia Grant]]. It is a classical domed mausoleum, located in the [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] neighborhood of [[Upper Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. The structure is located in the middle of [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] at 122nd Street, across from [[Riverside Church]] to the southeast and [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] to the west.\n\nOn Grant's death in 1885, his widow declared that he had wished to be buried in New York, and a new committee, the Grant Monument Association, appealed for funds. Progress was slow at first, since many believed that the tomb should be in Washington D.C., and because there was no architectural design to show. Eventually they selected a proposal by [[John H. Duncan|John Hemenway Duncan]] for a tomb of \"unmistakably military character\", modeled after the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], with twin sarcophagi based on [[Napoleon]]\u2019s tomb at [[Les Invalides]]. The tomb was completed in 1897, and has been under the management of the [[National Park Service]] since 1958. After a period of neglect, it has been restored and rededicated.\n\nGrant's Tomb is open to the public from Wednesdays through Saturdays. In addition to being a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] since 1958, Grant's Tomb was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966 and was designated an official [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] in 1975.\n\n==History==\n===Creation of Grant Monument Association===\nOn July 23, 1885, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] died of [[throat cancer]] at age 63 in [[Wilton, New York]]. Within hours of Grant's death, [[William Russell Grace]], the [[Mayor of New York City]], sent a telegram to Julia offering New York City to be the burial ground for both Grant and Julia. Grant's only real wish when he died was to be next to his wife when he was buried. In practice this eliminated all military cemeteries and installations (such as [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]) from consideration, as they did not permit women to be interred at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=5.}}</ref> Grant's family agreed to have his remains interred in New York City.<ref name=\"Kahn_28\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=28.}}</ref> Grace wrote a letter to prominent New Yorkers the following day, to gather support for a national monument in Grant's honor:<ref name=\"Kahn_28\"/>\n\n{{quote|Dear Sir: In order that the City of New York, which is to be the last resting place of General Grant, should initiate a movement to provide for the erection of a National Monument to the memory of the great soldier, and that she should do well and thoroughly her part, I respectfully request you to as one of a Committee to consider ways and means for raising the quota to be subscribed by the citizens of New York City for this object, and beg that you will attend a meeting to be held at the Mayor's office on Tuesday next, 28 inst., at three o'clock ...<ref name=\"Kahn_28\"/>}}\n\nThe preliminary meeting was attended by 85 New Yorkers who established the Committee on Organization. Its chairman was former President [[Chester A. Arthur]]; its secretary was [[Richard Theodore Greener]]. The organization would come to be known as the Grant Monument Association (GMA).<ref name=\"Kahn_29\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=29.}}</ref>\n\n====Funding====\nThe Grant Monument Association did not originally announce the function or structure of the monument; however, the idea of any monument in Grant's honor drew public support.<ref name=\"Kahn_29\"/> [[Western Union]] donated $5,000 on July 29, the day the committee announced its proposal.<ref name=\"Kahn_29\"/> The GMA continued to receive donations of large and small amounts. At a membership meeting, former New York State governor [[Alonzo Cornell]] proposed a fundraising goal of $1 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=31.}}</ref> Private industries such as insurance and iron-trading companies donated funds to the project. For every ton of coal the Consumers Coal Company sold, it gave a major donation of 37\u00bd cents to the GMA.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=32.}}</ref> Although there was great enthusiasm for a monument to President Grant, early fundraising efforts were stifled by growing negative public opinion expressed by out-of-state press.<ref name=\"Kahn_33\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=33.}}</ref> The ''Clay County Enterprise'' in [[Brazil, Indiana]], wrote, \"We have not a cent for New York in the undertaking, and would advise that not a dollar of help be sent to the millionaire city from Indiana ... If the billions of New York are not sufficient to embellish the city ... let the remains be placed in Washington or some other American city.\" (September 11)<ref name=\"Kahn_33\"/>\n\nThe opposition was vocal in the view that the monument should be in [[Washington, D.C.]] Mayor Grace tried to calm the controversy by publicly releasing Mrs. Grant's justification for the New York site as the resting place for her husband:\n\n{{quote|Riverside was selected by myself and my family as the burial place of my husband, General Grant. First, because I believed New York was his preference. Second, it is near the residence that I hope to occupy as long as I live, and where I will be able to visit his resting place often. Third, I have believed, and am now convinced, that the tomb will be visited by as many of his countrymen there as it would be at any other place. Fourth, the offer of a park in New York was the first which observed and unreservedly assented to the only condition imposed by General Grant himself, namely, that I should have a place by his side.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=12.}}</ref>}}\n\nCriticism was not limited to the debate about the monument's location. According to ''The New York Times'', there was discontent with the internal management of the GMA. Even though the GMA members were among the wealthiest in New York, they were making comparatively small donations to the effort they themselves were promoting. ''The New York Times'' characterized the members as \"sitting quietly in an office and signing receipts for money voluntarily tendered.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=35.}}</ref> In this early stage, the GMA did not have a model for what the monument was to be; it continued to ask for donations without explaining its purpose, which frustrated and discouraged donors.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=36.}}</ref> [[Joan Waugh]] captured the feelings of the average citizen in her book, ''American Hero American Myth'': \"Why should citizens give money to build a monument whose shape was still a mystery?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Waugh|2009|p=281.}}</ref> The GMA did not propose a definitive plan for the monument until five years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=37.}}</ref> During its first few years, the GMA fell short of the fundraising expectations originally set by Alonzo Cornell. In the first year, 1885, the GMA raised just over $111,000, 10% of its goal. In the two years that followed, it raised just $10,000. The slow pace of fundraising caused some trustees to resign. No design for the structure yet existed, and without such a design, it was believed that fundraising efforts would continue to remain low.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Design competition===\n{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal|total_width=400\n|image1=Abraham Lincoln and the battles of the Civil War (1886) (14576373539).jpg|caption1=Future site of tomb, 1886\n|image2=(King1893NYC) pg867 TOMB OF GEN.

The Grant Memorial Association did not award an overall winner, and a second design competition was ordered. In April 1890, the Grant Memorial Association selected, from only five commissioned entries, the design of [[John H. Duncan|John Hemenway Duncan]],<ref name=\"Kahn 1980 76\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=76.}}</ref> who estimated his design would cost between $496,000 and $900,000.<ref name=\"Kahn_77\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=77.}}</ref> Duncan made his first architectural claims in 1883, designing the Washington Monument at Newburgh, the Newburgh Monument, and the Tower of Victory.

Although the GMA was becoming more organized and the reality of the monument was becoming clearer, the debate over the monument's location reopened in Congress. In October 1890, U.S. Senator Hale introduced legislation to have the sarcophagi placed at a monument in Washington, DC.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=92.}}</ref> The legislation did not pass, but the effort reopened the debate over the proper place for the remains of Grant. A groundbreaking ceremony had already been scheduled for April 27, 1891, and although the parties had not agreed on a location for the monument by that date, a groundbreaking ceremony was still held.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=95.}}</ref> In June 1891, deliberations ended; the monument was to be built in New York City, and that month, the GMA hired a contractor named John T. Brady.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=96.}}</ref>\n\nConstruction began that summer, and by August, preliminary excavation was complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=99.}}</ref> Construction was on schedule until the GMA asked Duncan to alter his design in the spring of 1892; the design could not be as elaborate as originally planned because of the Association's inability to raise the sufficient funds.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=102.}}</ref> Construction was also slowed by a stonecutters' strike in 1892. After 1894, construction proceeded at a faster pace, and by 1896, work on the outside of the tomb was nearly complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=123.}}</ref> One innovative feature of the tomb construction is the use of [[Guastavino tile]] vaulting to support the circular floor above the perimeter of the downstairs atrium.\n\nOn April 17, 1897, Grant's remains were quietly transferred to an 8.5-ton red granite sarcophagus and placed in the mausoleum. The monument was dedicated ten days later on April 27, 1897, on the 75th-anniversary ceremony of Grant's birth on April 27, 1822.<ref>{{harvnb|Waugh|2009|p=162.}}</ref> Julia Dent Grant, Grant's wife of nearly 40 years, died five years later in 1902 and was placed in a matching sarcophagus and laid to rest in the mausoleum beside her husband.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Decay and restoration===\n\n==== 1930s restoration ====\nThe initial restoration project began in December 1935 (38 years after the tomb opened), when [[Works Progress Administration]] laborers installed new marble flooring in the atrium.<ref name=\"Kahn_164\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=164.}}</ref> The WPA played a large role in sustaining the monument. Joan Waugh explains that \"In the 1930s the tomb was barely maintained by funds from the Works Progress Administration.\" Shortly after the restoration project began, the old New York City Post Office was being demolished and donated two statues of eagles to decorate the front of the Grant Monument. The laborers of the WPA worked on several projects throughout the 1930s, including roof restoration, electric lighting and heating systems, and removing the purple stained glass windows. The Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company installed amber glass to replace the purple stained glass. Toward the end of the 1930s, a project began to restore the two reliquary rooms, where battle flags were displayed in trophy cases, and murals of the wars Grant had fought in were painted on the walls. In 1938, the [[Federal Art Project]] selected artists William Mues and Jeno Juszko to design the busts of [[William T. Sherman]], [[Phillip H. Sheridan]], [[George H. Thomas]], [[James B. McPherson]], and [[Edward Ord]].<ref name=\"Kahn_167\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=167.}}</ref> The WPA installed five busts in the circular wall of the atrium surrounding the sarcophagi. After the many contributions of the WPA, the Grant Monument Association held a re-dedication of the tomb on April 27, 1939.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=174.}}</ref>\n\n==== NPS control ====\n[[File:Ellen Bryan OHNY 10-2016 -13.jpg|thumb|left|Grant's Tomb, interior detail]]\n\nIn 1958, the National Park Service (NPS) was granted authority to oversee the monument. According to an NPS report, an historian admitted that when the NPS first assumed authority over the tomb, they \"had no program for the site.\"  Combined with the devastation that New York City was going through financially in the 1960s to the 1990s, that led to great negligence of the site, particularly in the maintenance of the monument.<ref name=\"grantstomb.org\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the tomb was marred by vandalism and [[graffiti]]. Many places in the city, including [[Times Square]], were in the same condition. Trash had heaped up around the monument, its exterior recesses were being used by drug users, the homeless, and criminals for hideouts. Graffiti covered the walls and pedestals, and vandals chipped away at the masonry. The NPS undertook a plan to remove the trophy cases in the reliquary rooms.<ref name=\"grantstomb.org\">{{cite web |title=The Tomb's Decline and Restoration |url=http://www.grantstomb.org/ind-gma.html |website=grantstomb.org |publisher=Grant Monument Association |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923013446/http://www.grantstomb.org/ind-gma.html |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== 1990s restoration ====\nThe abuse of the monument continued until renewed restoration efforts began in the early 1990s; in 1991, [[Frank Scaturro]], a student at Columbia University and volunteer with the NPS, launched an effort to restore the tomb and brought his concerns to Congress. The tomb was still marred by graffiti and, at the time, there were only three maintenance workers and three [[park ranger|rangers]] on daytime duty, with a yearly budget of $235,000.<ref name=\"grantstomb.org\" /> For over two years, Scaturro battled the National Park Service, which was charged with maintaining Grant's Tomb.

State Sen. [[Judy Baar Topinka]] and State Rep. [[Ron Lawfer]] sponsored a resolution to compel the National Park Service to meet its obligations in maintaining and restoring Grant's tomb. If the NPS did not comply, then Topinka and Lawfer demanded that Grant's remains be transported to the state of Illinois.

However, Marx often accepted the answer \"Grant,\" nonetheless, and awarded a consolation prize to those who gave it.

Grant]], 18th [[President of the United States]], and his wife, [[Julia Grant]]. It is a classical domed mausoleum, located in the [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] neighborhood of [[Upper Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. The structure is located in the middle of [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] at 122nd Street, across from [[Riverside Church]] to the southeast and [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] to the west.\n\nOn Grant's death in 1885, his widow declared that he had wished to be buried in New York, and a new committee, the Grant Monument Association, appealed for funds. Progress was slow at first, since many believed that the tomb should be in Washington D.C., and because there was no architectural design to show. Eventually they selected a proposal by [[John H. Duncan|John Hemenway Duncan]] for a tomb of \"unmistakably military character\", modeled after the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], with twin sarcophagi based on [[Napoleon]]\u2019s tomb at [[Les Invalides]]. The tomb was completed in 1897, and has been under the management of the [[National Park Service]] since 1958. After a period of neglect, it has been restored and rededicated.\n\nGrant's Tomb is open to the public from Wednesdays through Saturdays. In addition to being a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] since 1958, Grant's Tomb was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966 and was designated an official [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City landmark]] in 1975.\n\n==History==\n===Creation of Grant Monument Association===\nOn July 23, 1885, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] died of [[throat cancer]] at age 63 in [[Wilton, New York]]. Within hours of Grant's death, [[William Russell Grace]], the [[Mayor of New York City]], sent a telegram to Julia offering New York City to be the burial ground for both Grant and Julia. Grant's only real wish when he died was to be next to his wife when he was buried. In practice this eliminated all military cemeteries and installations (such as [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]) from consideration, as they did not permit women to be interred at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=5.}}</ref> Grant's family agreed to have his remains interred in New York City.<ref name=\"Kahn_28\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=28.}}</ref> Grace wrote a letter to prominent New Yorkers the following day, to gather support for a national monument in Grant's honor:<ref name=\"Kahn_28\"/>\n\n{{quote|Dear Sir: In order that the City of New York, which is to be the last resting place of General Grant, should initiate a movement to provide for the erection of a National Monument to the memory of the great soldier, and that she should do well and thoroughly her part, I respectfully request you to as one of a Committee to consider ways and means for raising the quota to be subscribed by the citizens of New York City for this object, and beg that you will attend a meeting to be held at the Mayor's office on Tuesday next, 28 inst., at three o'clock ...<ref name=\"Kahn_28\"/>}}\n\nThe preliminary meeting was attended by 85 New Yorkers who established the Committee on Organization. Its chairman was former President [[Chester A. Arthur]]; its secretary was [[Richard Theodore Greener]]. The organization would come to be known as the Grant Monument Association (GMA).<ref name=\"Kahn_29\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=29.}}</ref>\n\n====Funding====\nThe Grant Monument Association did not originally announce the function or structure of the monument; however, the idea of any monument in Grant's honor drew public support.<ref name=\"Kahn_29\"/> [[Western Union]] donated $5,000 on July 29, the day the committee announced its proposal.<ref name=\"Kahn_29\"/> The GMA continued to receive donations of large and small amounts. At a membership meeting, former New York State governor [[Alonzo Cornell]] proposed a fundraising goal of $1 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=31.}}</ref> Private industries such as insurance and iron-trading companies donated funds to the project. For every ton of coal the Consumers Coal Company sold, it gave a major donation of 37\u00bd cents to the GMA.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=32.}}</ref> Although there was great enthusiasm for a monument to President Grant, early fundraising efforts were stifled by growing negative public opinion expressed by out-of-state press.<ref name=\"Kahn_33\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=33.}}</ref> The ''Clay County Enterprise'' in [[Brazil, Indiana]], wrote, \"We have not a cent for New York in the undertaking, and would advise that not a dollar of help be sent to the millionaire city from Indiana ... If the billions of New York are not sufficient to embellish the city ... let the remains be placed in Washington or some other American city.\" (September 11)<ref name=\"Kahn_33\"/>\n\nThe opposition was vocal in the view that the monument should be in [[Washington, D.C.]] Mayor Grace tried to calm the controversy by publicly releasing Mrs. Grant's justification for the New York site as the resting place for her husband:\n\n{{quote|Riverside was selected by myself and my family as the burial place of my husband, General Grant. First, because I believed New York was his preference. Second, it is near the residence that I hope to occupy as long as I live, and where I will be able to visit his resting place often. Third, I have believed, and am now convinced, that the tomb will be visited by as many of his countrymen there as it would be at any other place. Fourth, the offer of a park in New York was the first which observed and unreservedly assented to the only condition imposed by General Grant himself, namely, that I should have a place by his side.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=12.}}</ref>}}\n\nCriticism was not limited to the debate about the monument's location. According to ''The New York Times'', there was discontent with the internal management of the GMA. Even though the GMA members were among the wealthiest in New York, they were making comparatively small donations to the effort they themselves were promoting. ''The New York Times'' characterized the members as \"sitting quietly in an office and signing receipts for money voluntarily tendered.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=35.}}</ref> In this early stage, the GMA did not have a model for what the monument was to be; it continued to ask for donations without explaining its purpose, which frustrated and discouraged donors.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=36.}}</ref> [[Joan Waugh]] captured the feelings of the average citizen in her book, ''American Hero American Myth'': \"Why should citizens give money to build a monument whose shape was still a mystery?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Waugh|2009|p=281.}}</ref> The GMA did not propose a definitive plan for the monument until five years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=37.}}</ref> During its first few years, the GMA fell short of the fundraising expectations originally set by Alonzo Cornell. In the first year, 1885, the GMA raised just over $111,000, 10% of its goal. In the two years that followed, it raised just $10,000. The slow pace of fundraising caused some trustees to resign. No design for the structure yet existed, and without such a design, it was believed that fundraising efforts would continue to remain low.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Design competition===\n{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal|total_width=400\n|image1=Abraham Lincoln and the battles of the Civil War (1886) (14576373539).jpg|caption1=Future site of tomb, 1886\n|image2=(King1893NYC) pg867 TOMB OF GEN.

The Grant Memorial Association did not award an overall winner, and a second design competition was ordered. In April 1890, the Grant Memorial Association selected, from only five commissioned entries, the design of [[John H. Duncan|John Hemenway Duncan]],<ref name=\"Kahn 1980 76\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=76.}}</ref> who estimated his design would cost between $496,000 and $900,000.<ref name=\"Kahn_77\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=77.}}</ref> Duncan made his first architectural claims in 1883, designing the Washington Monument at Newburgh, the Newburgh Monument, and the Tower of Victory.

Although the GMA was becoming more organized and the reality of the monument was becoming clearer, the debate over the monument's location reopened in Congress. In October 1890, U.S. Senator Hale introduced legislation to have the sarcophagi placed at a monument in Washington, DC.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=92.}}</ref> The legislation did not pass, but the effort reopened the debate over the proper place for the remains of Grant. A groundbreaking ceremony had already been scheduled for April 27, 1891, and although the parties had not agreed on a location for the monument by that date, a groundbreaking ceremony was still held.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=95.}}</ref> In June 1891, deliberations ended; the monument was to be built in New York City, and that month, the GMA hired a contractor named John T. Brady.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=96.}}</ref>\n\nConstruction began that summer, and by August, preliminary excavation was complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=99.}}</ref> Construction was on schedule until the GMA asked Duncan to alter his design in the spring of 1892; the design could not be as elaborate as originally planned because of the Association's inability to raise the sufficient funds.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=102.}}</ref> Construction was also slowed by a stonecutters' strike in 1892. After 1894, construction proceeded at a faster pace, and by 1896, work on the outside of the tomb was nearly complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=123.}}</ref> One innovative feature of the tomb construction is the use of [[Guastavino tile]] vaulting to support the circular floor above the perimeter of the downstairs atrium.\n\nOn April 17, 1897, Grant's remains were quietly transferred to an 8.5-ton red granite sarcophagus and placed in the mausoleum. The monument was dedicated ten days later on April 27, 1897, on the 75th-anniversary ceremony of Grant's birth on April 27, 1822.<ref>{{harvnb|Waugh|2009|p=162.}}</ref> Julia Dent Grant, Grant's wife of nearly 40 years, died five years later in 1902 and was placed in a matching sarcophagus and laid to rest in the mausoleum beside her husband.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Decay and restoration===\n\n==== 1930s restoration ====\nThe initial restoration project began in December 1935 (38 years after the tomb opened), when [[Works Progress Administration]] laborers installed new marble flooring in the atrium.<ref name=\"Kahn_164\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=164.}}</ref> The WPA played a large role in sustaining the monument. Joan Waugh explains that \"In the 1930s the tomb was barely maintained by funds from the Works Progress Administration.\" Shortly after the restoration project began, the old New York City Post Office was being demolished and donated two statues of eagles to decorate the front of the Grant Monument. The laborers of the WPA worked on several projects throughout the 1930s, including roof restoration, electric lighting and heating systems, and removing the purple stained glass windows. The Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company installed amber glass to replace the purple stained glass. Toward the end of the 1930s, a project began to restore the two reliquary rooms, where battle flags were displayed in trophy cases, and murals of the wars Grant had fought in were painted on the walls. In 1938, the [[Federal Art Project]] selected artists William Mues and Jeno Juszko to design the busts of [[William T. Sherman]], [[Phillip H. Sheridan]], [[George H. Thomas]], [[James B. McPherson]], and [[Edward Ord]].<ref name=\"Kahn_167\">{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=167.}}</ref> The WPA installed five busts in the circular wall of the atrium surrounding the sarcophagi. After the many contributions of the WPA, the Grant Monument Association held a re-dedication of the tomb on April 27, 1939.<ref>{{harvnb|Kahn|1980|p=174.}}</ref>\n\n==== NPS control ====\n[[File:Ellen Bryan OHNY 10-2016 -13.jpg|thumb|left|Grant's Tomb, interior detail]]\n\nIn 1958, the National Park Service (NPS) was granted authority to oversee the monument. According to an NPS report, an historian admitted that when the NPS first assumed authority over the tomb, they \"had no program for the site.\"  Combined with the devastation that New York City was going through financially in the 1960s to the 1990s, that led to great negligence of the site, particularly in the maintenance of the monument.<ref name=\"grantstomb.org\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the tomb was marred by vandalism and [[graffiti]]. Many places in the city, including [[Times Square]], were in the same condition. Trash had heaped up around the monument, its exterior recesses were being used by drug users, the homeless, and criminals for hideouts. Graffiti covered the walls and pedestals, and vandals chipped away at the masonry. The NPS undertook a plan to remove the trophy cases in the reliquary rooms.<ref name=\"grantstomb.org\">{{cite web |title=The Tomb's Decline and Restoration |url=http://www.grantstomb.org/ind-gma.html |website=grantstomb.org |publisher=Grant Monument Association |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923013446/http://www.grantstomb.org/ind-gma.html |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== 1990s restoration ====\nThe abuse of the monument continued until renewed restoration efforts began in the early 1990s; in 1991, [[Frank Scaturro]], a student at Columbia University and volunteer with the NPS, launched an effort to restore the tomb and brought his concerns to Congress. The tomb was still marred by graffiti and, at the time, there were only three maintenance workers and three [[park ranger|rangers]] on daytime duty, with a yearly budget of $235,000.<ref name=\"grantstomb.org\" /> For over two years, Scaturro battled the National Park Service, which was charged with maintaining Grant's Tomb.

State Sen. [[Judy Baar Topinka]] and State Rep. [[Ron Lawfer]] sponsored a resolution to compel the National Park Service to meet its obligations in maintaining and restoring Grant's tomb. If the NPS did not comply, then Topinka and Lawfer demanded that Grant's remains be transported to the state of Illinois.
