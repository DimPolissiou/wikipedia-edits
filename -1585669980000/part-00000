The voiceless aspirated plosives have two allophonic variants each: those with a delay in voicing {{IPA|([p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0])}}, and those with velar friction {{IPA|([p\u02e3 t\u02e3 k\u02e3])}}, which occur before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0129/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0169/}} (thus, {{lang|lkt|lakh\u00f3ta}}, {{IPA|/la\u02c8k\u02b0ota/}} is phonetically {{IPA|[la\u02c8k\u02e3ota]}}). For some speakers, there is a phonemic distinction between the two, and both occur before {{IPA|/e/}}. No such variation occurs for the affricate /t\u0283\u02b0/. Some orthographies mark this distinction; others do not. The uvular fricatives {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} and {{IPA|/\u0281/}} are commonly spelled {{angle bracket|\u021f}} and {{angle bracket|\u01e7}}.\n\nAll [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words have one vowel which carries primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and has a higher tone than all other vowels in the word. This is generally the vowel of the second syllable of the word, but often the first syllable can be stressed, and occasionally other syllables as well. Stress is generally indicated with an acute accent: {{angle bracket|\u00e1}}, etc. Compound words will have stressed vowels in each component; proper spelling will write compounds with a hyphen. Thus {{lang|lkt|m\u00e1za-sk\u00e1}}, literally \"metal-white\", i.e. \"silver; money\" has two stressed vowels, the first ''a'' in each component. If it were written without the hyphen, as {{lang|lkt|mazaska}}, it would imply a single main stress.\n\n===Orthography===\nThe majority of educational institutions across Lakota country adopted the writing system of the ''New Lakota Dictionary'' as the standard orthography. It is used, among other places, at [[Sitting Bull College]], Oglala Lakota College, by all schools of the [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]], by the majority of teachers of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and in almost all schools on Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>.

An apostrophe, \u2019, is used for the [[glottal stop]].\n\nA [[caron]] is used for sounds, other than {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, which are not written with Latin letters in the IPA: ''\u010d'' {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, ''\u01e7'' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, ''\u021f'' {{IPA|/\u03c7/}}, ''\u0161'' {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, ''\u017e'' {{IPA|/\u0292/}}. Aspirates are written with ''h'': ''\u010dh, kh, ph, th,'' and velar frication with ''\u021f'': ''k\u021f, p\u021f, t\u021f.'' Ejectives are written with an apostrophe: ''\u010d\u2019, \u021f\u2019, k\u2019, p\u2019, s\u2019, \u0161\u2019, t\u2019&zwnj;''.\n\nThe spelling used in modern popular texts is often written without diacritics. Besides failing to mark stress, this also results in the confusion of numerous consonants: {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} are both written ''s'', {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} are both written ''h'', and the aspirate stops are written like the unaspirates, as ''p, t, c, k''.\n\n====Alphabet====\n\nStandard Lakota Orthography, as used by the majority of schools, is in principle phonemic, which means that each character ([[grapheme]]) represents one distinctive sound ([[phoneme]]), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration, which is treated phonetically.\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Lakota alphabet\n|-\n!Letter\n!Name of the letter\n!Usual phonetic value ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n|-\n|'''A&nbsp;a'''\n|a\n|{{IPA|[a]}}\n|-\n|'''A\u014b&nbsp;a\u014b'''\n|a\u014b\n|{{IPA|[\u0259\u0303]}}\n|-\n|'''B&nbsp;b'''\n|be\n|{{IPA|[b]}}\n|-\n|'''\u010c&nbsp;\u010d'''\n|\u010du\n|{{IPA|[t\u0283]}}\n|-\n|'''\u010ch&nbsp;\u010dh'''\n|\u010dhi\n|{{IPA|[t\u0283\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''\u010c\u2019&nbsp;\u010d\u2019'''\n|\u010d\u2019\u00f3\n|{{IPA|[t\u0283\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''E&nbsp;e'''\n|e\n|{{IPA|[\u025b]}}\n|-\n|'''G&nbsp;g'''\n|gli\n|{{IPA|[\u0261]}}\n|-\n|'''\u01e6&nbsp;\u01e7'''\n|\u01e7u\n|{{IPA|[\u0281] / [\u0280]}}\n|-\n|'''H&nbsp;h'''\n|ha\n|{{IPA|[h]}}\n|-\n|'''\u021e&nbsp;\u021f'''\n|\u021fe\n|{{IPA|[\u03c7]}}\n|-\n|'''I&nbsp;i'''\n|i\n|{{IPA|[\u026a]}}\n|-\n|'''I\u014b&nbsp;i\u014b'''\n|i\u014b\n|{{IPA|[\u026a\u0303]}}\n|-\n|'''K&nbsp;k'''\n|ku\n|{{IPA|[k]}}\n|-\n|'''Kh&nbsp;kh'''\n|khi\n|{{IPA|[k\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''K\u021f&nbsp;k\u021f'''\n|k\u021fa\n|{{IPA|[k\u02e3]}}\n|-\n|'''K\u2019&nbsp;k\u2019'''\n|k\u2019o\n|{{IPA|[k\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''L&nbsp;l'''\n|la\n|{{IPA|[l]}}\n|-\n|'''M&nbsp;m'''\n|ma\n|{{IPA|[m]}}\n|-\n|'''N&nbsp;n'''\n|na\n|{{IPA|[n]}}\n|-\n|'''O&nbsp;o'''\n|o\n|{{IPA|[\u0254]}}\n|-\n|'''P&nbsp;p'''\n|pu\n|{{IPA|[p]}}\n|-\n|'''Ph&nbsp;ph'''\n|phi\n|{{IPA|[p\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''P\u021f&nbsp;p\u021f'''\n|p\u021fa\n|{{IPA|[p\u02e3]}}\n|-\n|'''P\u2019&nbsp;p\u2019'''\n|p\u2019o\n|{{IPA|[p\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''S&nbsp;s'''\n|sa\n|{{IPA|[s]}}\n|-\n|'''\u0160&nbsp;\u0161'''\n|\u0161e\n|{{IPA|[\u0283]}}\n|-\n|'''T&nbsp;t'''\n|tu\n|{{IPA|[t]}}\n|-\n|'''Th&nbsp;th'''\n|thi\n|{{IPA|[t\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''T\u021f&nbsp;t\u021f'''\n|t\u021fa\n|{{IPA|[t\u02e3]}}\n|-\n|'''T\u2019&nbsp;t\u2019'''\n|t\u2019o\n|{{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''U&nbsp;u'''\n|u\n|{{IPA|[\u028a]}}\n|-\n|'''U\u014b&nbsp;u\u014b'''\n|u\u014b\n|{{IPA|[\u028a\u0303]}}\n|-\n|'''W&nbsp;w'''\n|wa\n|{{IPA|[w]}}\n|-\n|'''Y&nbsp;y'''\n|ya\n|{{IPA|[j]}}\n|-\n|'''Z&nbsp;z'''\n|za\n|{{IPA|[z]}}\n|-\n|'''\u017d&nbsp;\u017e'''\n|\u017ee\n|{{IPA|[\u0292]}}\n|-\n|'''\u2019'''\n|kh\u00e9ze\n|{{IPA|[\u0294]}}\n|}{{col-end}}\n\nAll digraphs (i.e. characters created by two letters, such as kh, k\u021f, k\u2019) are treated as groups of individual letters in alphabetization. Thus for example the word {{lang|lkt|\u010dh\u00ed\u014b}} precedes {{lang|lkt|\u010d\u00f3nala}} in a dictionary.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\nA common phonological process which occurs in rapid speech is ''vowel contraction'', which generally results from the loss of an intervocalic glide. Vowel contraction results in phonetic long vowels ([[phoneme|phonemically]] a sequence of two identical vowels), with falling pitch if the first underlying vowel is stressed, and rising pitch if the second underlying vowel is stressed: ''k\u00ea:'' (falling tone), \"he said that\", from {{lang|lkt|k\u00e9ye}}; ''h\u01ce:pi'' (rising tone), \"clothing\", from {{lang|lkt|hay\u00e1pi}}. If one of the vowels is nasalized, the resulting long vowel is also nasalized: ''\u010dha\u014b\u030c:pi'', \"sugar\", from {{lang|lkt|\u010dha\u014bh\u00e1\u014bpi}}.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nWhen two vowels of unequal height contract, or when feature contrasts exist between the vowels and the glide, two new phonetic vowels, {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}, result:<ref name=\"rood96\" /> ''iy\u00e6\u0302:'', \"he left for there\", from {{lang|lkt|iy\u00e1ye}}; ''mit\u021fa:'', \"it's mine\", from {{lang|lkt|mit\u021f\u00e1wa}}.\n\nThe plural [[clitic|enclitic]] ''=pi'' is frequently changed in rapid speech when preceding the enclitics ''=kte'', ''=ki\u014b'', ''=k\u0161t\u00f3'', or ''=na''. If the vowel preceding ''=pi'' is high/open, ''=pi'' becomes [u]; if the vowel is non-high (mid or closed), ''=pi'' becomes [o] (if the preceding vowel is nasalized, then the resulting vowel is also nasalized): ''hi=pi=kte'', \"they will arrive here\", [hiukte]; ''yatk\u00e1\u014b=pi=na'', \"they drank it and...\", {{IPA|[jatk\u0259\u0303\u00f5na]}}.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nLakota also exhibits some traces of sound symbolism among fricatives, where the [[point of articulation]] changes to reflect intensity: {{lang|lkt|z\u00ed}}, \"it's yellow\", {{lang|lkt|\u017e\u00ed}}, \"it's tawny\", {{lang|lkt|\u01e7\u00ed}}, \"it's brown\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mithun |first=Marianne |year=2007 |title=The Languages of Native North America|location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=33}}</ref> (Compare with the similar examples in [[Mandan language#Vocabulary|Mandan]].)\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Word order===\n\nThe basic word order of Lakota is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], although the order can be changed for expressive purposes (placing the object before the subject to bring the object into focus or placing the subject after the verb to emphasize its status as established information). It is [[adposition#Postpositions|postpositional]], with adpositions occurring after the head nouns: {{lang|lkt|mas'\u00f3phiye \u00e9l}}, \"at the store\" (literally 'store at'); {{lang|lkt|2=th\u00edpi=ki\u014b \u00f3k\u0161a\u014b}}, \"around the house\" (literally 'house=the around') (Rood and Taylor 1996).\n\nRood and Taylor (1996) suggest the following template for basic word order. Items in parenthesis are optional; only the verb is required. It is therefore possible to produce a grammatical sentence that contains only a verb.\n<blockquote>(interjection) (conjunction) (adverb(s)) (nominal) (nominal) (nominal) (adverb(s)) verb (enclitic(s)) (conjunction)</blockquote>\n\n===Interjections===\n\nWhen [[interjection]]s are used, they begin the sentence or end it. A small number of interjections are used only by one gender, for instance the interjection expressing disbelief is {{lang|lkt|e\u010d\u00e9\u0161}} for women but {{lang|lkt|h\u00f3\u021f}} for men; for calling attention women say {{lang|lkt|m\u00e1\u014b}} while men use {{lang|lkt|w\u00e1\u014b}}. Most interjections, however, are used by both genders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Conjunctions===\n\nIt is common for a sentence to begin with a conjunction. Both {{lang|lkt|\u010dha\u014bk\u00e9}} and {{lang|lkt|yu\u014bk\u021f\u00e1\u014b}} can be translated as ''and''; {{lang|lkt|k\u2019\u00e9ya\u0161}} is similar to English ''but''. Each of these conjunctions joins clauses. In addition, the conjunction {{lang|lkt|na}} joins nouns or phrases.\n\n===Adverbs, postpositions and derived modifiers===\n\nLakota uses [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], which are similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. [[Adverb]]s or postpositional phrases can describe manner, location, or reason. There are also [[interrogative word|interrogative]] adverbs, which are used to form questions. \n\nUllrich (2018) is the first one to show that many words traditionally classified as adverbs actually do not function adverbially and that a better term for these words is 'derived modifiers'. A typical example is the word {{lang|lkt|h\u00e9\u010dhel}}, which is traditionally translated with \"in that way\" but when used with transitive verbs, it always modifies the object argument and not the verb, as in H\u00e9\u010dhel wa\u014bbl\u00e1ke. 'I saw such a thing' (and not * 'In such a way I saw it'). (http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~rrgpage/rrg/Ullrich.pdf)\n\n====Synonymity in the postpositions {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} and {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}}====\n\nTo the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} and {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}} sound like they can be interchangeable, but although they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as locational and directional tools. In the English language they can be compared to prepositions like \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as locatives) on the one hand, and \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as directionals), \"to\", \"into\", and \"onto\", on the other. (Pustet 2013)\n\nA pointer for when to use {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} and when to use {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}} can be determined by the concepts of location  (motionless) or motion; and space vs. time. These features can produce four different combinations, also called semantic domains, which can be arranged as follows (Pustet 2013):\n\n# space / rest: \"in the house\" [th\u00edpi ki\u014b \u00e9l] (This sentence is only describing location of an object, no movement indicated)\n# space / motion: \"to the house [th\u00edpi ki\u014b ekt\u00e1] (This sentence is referring to movement of a subject, it is directional in nature)\n# time / rest: \"in the winter\" [wan\u00edyetu ki\u014b \u00e9l] (This sentence refers to a static moment in time, which happens to be during winter)\n# time / motion: \"in/towards the winter\" [wan\u00edyetu ki\u014b ekt\u00e1] (Pustet 2013) (This sentence is delegated to time, but time which is soon to change to another season)\n\nSummed up, when a context describes no motion, {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} is the appropriate postposition; when in motion, {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}} is more appropriate. They are both used in matters of time and space.\n\n===Nouns and pronouns===\n\nAs mentioned above, [[noun phrase|nominals]] are optional in Lakota, but when nouns appear the basic word order is subject\u2013object\u2013verb. Pronouns are not common, but may be used [[contrast (linguistics)|contrastively]] or emphatically.\n\nLakota has four [[article (grammar)|articles]]: {{lang|lkt|wa\u014b}} is indefinite, similar to English ''a'' or ''an'', and {{lang|lkt|ki\u014b}} is definite, similar to English ''the''. In addition, {{lang|lkt|wa\u014b\u017e\u00ed}} is an indefinite article used with hypothetical or [[irrealis mood|irrealis]] objects, and {{lang|lkt|k\u2019u\u014b}} is a definite article used with nouns that have been mentioned previously.\n\n===Demonstratives===\n\nThere are also nine [[demonstrative]]s, which can function either as pronouns or as [[determiner (class)|determiners]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| \n! colspan=3 | Distance from speaker\n|-\n| \n!'''near the speaker'''\n!'''near the listener'''\n!'''away from the listener'''\n|-\n\n| '''singular''' || {{lang|lkt|l\u00e9}} || {{lang|lkt|h\u00e9}} || {{lang|lkt|k\u00e1}}\n|-\n| '''dual''' || {{lang|lkt|len\u00e1os}} || {{lang|lkt|hen\u00e1os}} || {{lang|lkt|kan\u00e1os}} \n|-\n| '''plural''' || {{lang|lkt|len\u00e1}} || {{lang|lkt|hen\u00e1}} || {{lang|lkt|kan\u00e1}}\n|}\n\nIn traditional grammars, the three groups of demonstratives are described as pointing to objects \"near\", \"neutral distance\" and \"far\", but New Lakota Dictionary (Second Edition, 2012) is the first publication to show that the choice of demonstratives is in fact based on the position respective to the speaker and the listener, and that the {{lang|lkt|k\u00e1}} series refer to objects away from both the speaker and listener.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nVerbs are the only word class that are obligatory in a Lakota sentence. Verbs can be active, naming an action, or [[Stative verb|stative]], describing a property. (Note that in English, such descriptions are usually made with [[adjective]]s.)\n\nVerbs are [[Inflection|inflected]] for first-, second- or third [[Grammatical person|person]], and for singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] or plural [[grammatical number]].\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Verb inflection====\n\nThere are two paradigms for verb [[inflection]]. One set of [[morpheme]]s indicates the [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of active verbs. The other set of morphemes [[Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]] with the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[Transitive verb|transitive]] action verbs ''or'' the subject of stative verbs.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nMost of the morphemes in each paradigm are prefixes, but plural subjects are marked with a suffix and third-person plural objects with an [[infix]].\n\nFirst person arguments may be singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], or plural; second or third person arguments may be singular or plural.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Subject of active verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || wa- || u\u014b(k)- || u\u014b(k)- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ya- ||  || ya- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''[[Markedness|unmarked]]'' ||  || -pi\n|}\n\n'''Examples:''' ''m\u00e1ni'' \"He walks.\" ''m\u00e1nipi'' \"They walk.\"\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Subject of stative verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || ma- || u\u014b(k)- || u\u014b(k)- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ni- ||  || ni- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''unmarked'' ||  || -pi\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Object of transitive verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || ma- ||  || u\u014b(k)- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ni- ||  || ni- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''unmarked'' ||  || -wicha-\n|}\n\n'''Example:''' ''wa\u014bw\u00ed\u010dhaya\u014bke'' \"He looked at them\" from ''wa\u014by\u00e1\u014bkA'' \"to look at something/somebody\".\n\n'''Subject and object pronouns in one verb'''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br/>\nIf both the subject and object need to be marked, two affixes occur on the verb. Below is a table illustrating this. Subject affixes are marked in ''italics'' and object affixes are marked in <u>underline</u>. Some affixes encompass both subject and object (such as ''\u010dhi''- ...). The symbol '''\u2205''' indicates a lack of marking for a particular subject/object (as in the case of 3rd Person Singular forms). Cells with three forms indicate Class I, Class II, and Class III verb forms in this order.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''<u>me</u>'''\n|'''<u>you (sg.)</u>'''\n|'''<u>him/her/it; them (inanimate)</u>'''\n|'''<u>us</u>'''\n|'''<u>you (pl.)</u>'''\n|'''<u>them (animate)</u>'''\n|-\n| '''''I''''' || || ''\u010dhi''-<sup>1</sup> ... || ''wa''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''bl''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''m''<u>\u2205</u>- ... ||  || ''\u010dhi''- ... -<u>pi</u> || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''wa''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''bl''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''m''- ...\n|-\n| '''''you (sg.)''''' || <u>ma</u>''ya''- ...<br><u>ma</u>''yal''-<sup>2</sup> ...<br><u>ma</u>''yan''- ... || || ''ya''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''l''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''n''<u>\u2205</u>- ... || <u>u\u014b</u>''ya''- ... -<u>pi</u><br><u>u\u014b</u>''l''- ... -<u>pi</u><br><u>u\u014b</u>''n''- ... -<u>pi</u> || || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''ya''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''l''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''n''- ...\n|-\n| '''''he/she/it''''' || <u>ma</u>''\u2205''- ... || <u>ni</u>''\u2205''- ... || <u>\u2205</u>''\u2205''- ... || <u>u\u014b(k)</u>''\u2205''- ... -<u>pi</u> || <u>ni</u>''\u2205''- ... -<u>pi</u> || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''\u2205''- ...\n|-\n| '''''we''''' || || ''u\u014b''<u>ni</u>-<sup>3</sup> ... -''pi'' || ''u\u014b(k)''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi'' || || ''u\u014b''<u>ni</u>- ... -''<u>pi</u>'' || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''u\u014b(k)''-<sup>4</sup> ... -''pi''\n|-\n| '''''you (pl.)''''' || <u>ma</u>''ya''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>ma</u>''yal''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>ma</u>''yan''- ... -''pi'' || || ''ya''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi''<br> ''l''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi''<br> ''n''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi'' || <u>u\u014b</u>''ya''- ... -''<u>pi</u>''<sup>5</sup><br>  <u>u\u014b</u>''l''- ... -''<u>pi</u>''<br>  <u>u\u014b</u>''n''- ... -''<u>pi</u>'' || || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''ya''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>wi\u010dha</u>''l''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>wi\u010dha</u>''n''- ... -''pi''\n|-\n| '''''they''''' || <u>ma</u>- ... -''pi'' || <u>ni</u>- ... -''pi'' || ... -<u>\u2205</u>''pi'' || <u>u\u014b</u>- ... -''<u>pi</u>'' || <u>ni</u>- ... -''pi'' || <u>wi\u010dha</u>- ... -''pi''\n|}\n\n*<sup>1</sup> The affix ''\u010dhi''- covers cases where I-subject and you-object occurs in transitive verbs.\n*<sup>2</sup> Class II and Class III verbs have irregular ''yal''- and ''yan''- respectively.\n*<sup>3</sup> These prefixes are separated when ''u\u014b(k)''- must be prefixed while ''ni''- et al. must be infixed.\n'''Example:''' '''''u\u014bk'''\u00e1'''ni'''p\u021fepi'' \"We are waiting for you\" from ''ap\u021f\u00e9'' \"to wait for somebody\".\n*<sup>4</sup> ''u\u014b(k)''- precedes all affixes except ''wi\u010dha''-. In the last column, verbs which require ''u\u014b(k)''- to be prefixed are more complex because of competing rules: ''u\u014b(k)''- must be prefixed, but must also follow ''wi\u010dha''-. Most speakers resolve this issue by infixing ''wi\u010dhau\u014b(k)'' after the initial vowel, then repeating the initial vowel again.\n'''Example:''' ''i'''w\u00ed\u010dhau\u014bk'''i\u010du'''pi''''' \"We took them\" from ''i\u010d\u00fa'' \"to take something/somebody\".\n*<sup>5</sup> Since the suffix -''pi'' can appear only once in each verb, but may pluralize either subject or object (or both), some ambiguity exists in the forms: ''u\u014b- ... -pi'', ''u\u014bni- ... -pi'', and ''u\u014bya-/u\u014bl-/u\u014bn- ... -pi''.\n\n====Enclitics====\n\nLakota has a number of [[enclitic]] [[Grammatical particle|particles]] which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.\n\nSome enclitics indicate the aspect, mood, or number of the verb they follow. There are also various [[interrogative]] enclitics, which in addition to marking an utterance as a question show finer distinctions of meaning. For example, while ''he'' is the usual question-marking enclitic, ''hu\u014bw\u00f3'' is used for [[rhetorical question]]s or in formal [[Public speaking|oratory]], and the [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] ''wa'' functions somewhat like a [[tag question]] in English (Rood and Taylor 1996; Buchel 1983). (See also the section below on men and women's speech.)\n\n=====Men's and women's speech=====\nA small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. ''Yel\u00f3'' (men) ''ye'' (women) mark mild assertions. ''K\u0161t\u00f3'' (women only according to most sources) marks strong assertion. ''Yo'' (men) and ''ye'' (women) mark neutral commands, ''yet\u021f\u00f3'' (men) and ''nit\u021f\u00f3'' (women) mark familiar, and ''ye'' (both men and women) and ''na'' mark requests. ''He'' is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use ''h\u0173w\u00f3'' in more formal situations. ''So'' (men) and ''se'' (women) mark [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).\n\nWhile many [[First language|native speakers]] and [[Linguistics|linguists]] agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular [[gender]]s, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa (Trechter 1999).\n\n'''Examples of enclitic usage'''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Enclitic'''\n|'''Meaning'''\n|'''Example'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Deloria |first=Ella |year=1932 |title=Dakota Texts|location=New York|publisher=G.E.

Compare these sentences.\n\n''\u0160\u00fa\u014bka ki\u014b s\u00e1pa \u010dha wa\u014bbl\u00e1ke.'' <br />\n''\u0160\u00fa\u014bka ki\u014b s\u00e1pe.'' <br />\n''\u0160\u00fa\u014bka ki\u014b s\u00e1pi\u014b na t\u021f\u00e1\u014bka.''\n\nThe last vowel in the word \"''S\u00e1pA''\" changed each time. This vowel change is called \"ablaut\". Words which undergo this change are referred to as A-words, since, in dictionary citations, they are written ending in either -A or -A\u014b. These words are never written with a final capital letter in actual texts. Derivatives of these words generally take the ablaut as well, however there are exceptions.\n\nThere are three forms for ablauted words: ''-a/-a\u014b'', ''-e'', ''-i\u014b''. These are referred to as a/a\u014b-ablaut, e-ablaut, and i\u014b-ablaut respectively. Some words are ablauted by some and not others, like \"gray\" ''h\u00f3ta'' or ''h\u00f3tA''. Ablaut always depends on what word follows the ablauted word.\n\n====A/a\u014b-ablaut====\n\nThis is the basic form of the word, and is used everywhere in which the other forms are not utilized.\n\n====E-ablaut====\n\nThere are two cases in which e-ablaut is used.\n# Last word in the sentence\n# Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut\n\n=====1. Last word in sentence=====\n;Examples\n\n:''H\u00e9\u010dhiya y\u00e9'' He went there. (e-ablaut of the verb ''y\u00c1'')\n:''Y\u00fate'' She ate it. (e-ablaut of the verb ''y\u00fatA'')\n:''Th\u00edpi ki\u014b pah\u00e1 ak\u00e1\u014bl h\u00e9.'' The house stands on a cliff. (e-ablaut of the verb ''h\u00c1\u014b'')\n\n=====2. Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut=====\nThere are three classes of words which trigger e-ablaut\n\na) various enclitics, such as ''\u021f\u010da, \u021f\u010di\u014b, i\u014b\u010dh\u00e9ye, ka\u010dh\u00e1\u0161, kil\u00f3, k\u0161t\u00f3, kt\u00f3k, lak\u021fa, -la, l\u00e1\u021f, l\u00e1\u021f\u010daka, l\u00f3, s\u00e9\u010dA, s\u00e9kse, s\u2019el\u00e9\u010dhe\u010da, so, s\u2019a, s\u2019e, \u0161a\u014b, \u0161ni, u\u014b\u0161t\u00f3''<br />\nb) some conjunctions and articles, such as ''ki\u014b, ki\u014bh\u00e1\u014b, k\u2019\u00e9a\u0161, k\u2019u\u014b, eh\u00e1\u014bta\u014b\u0161''<br />\nc) some auxiliary verbs, such as ''kap\u00ed\u014b, kin\u00ed\u010da (kin\u00edl), lakA (la), k\u00fa\u014bzA, phi\u010da, \u0161i, wa\u010dh\u00ed\u014b, -yA, -khiyA''<br />\n\n;Examples\n\n:''\u0160k\u00e1te \u0161ni.''

He pretended to go home. (auxiliary verb)\n:''Yatk\u00e9-phi\u010da.'' It is drinkable. (auxiliary verb)\n\n====I\u014b-ablaut====\n\nThe ''i\u014b''-ablaut (pronounced ''i'' by some) occurs only before the following words:\n\n''ktA'' (irrealis enclitic)<br />\n''yet\u021f\u00f3'' (familiar command enclitic)<br />\n''na, nah\u00e1\u014b'' (and)<br />\n''na\u00ed\u014b\u0161'' (or, and or)<br />\n''y\u00e9'' (polite request or entreaty enclitic)\n\n;Examples\n\n:''Wa\u014by\u00e1\u014bki\u014b yet\u021f\u00f3.''

Please, look at it.\n\n==Phrases==\n\n\"''H\u00e1u k\u021fol\u00e1''\", literally \"Hello, friend\", is the most common greeting, and was transformed into the generic motion picture American Indian \"[[How (greeting)|How]]!\", just as the traditional feathered headdress of the Teton was \"given\" to all movie Indians. As ''h\u00e1u'' is the only word in Lakota which contains a [[diphthong]], {{IPA|/au/}}, it may be a loanword from a non-Siouan language.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nOther than using the word \"friend\", one often uses the word \"cousin\" or \"cross-cousin\" since everyone in the tribe was as family to each other. These words are very important to the speaker's tone of proper respect. The terms are as follow:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n''T\u021fa\u014bh\u00e1\u014b\u0161i'' N - my male cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n''T\u021fa\u014bh\u00e1\u014b\u0161itku'' N - his male cross-cousin<br>\n''T\u021fa\u014bh\u00e1\u014b\u0161iyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n''Ha\u014bk\u00e1\u0161i'' N - my female cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n''Ha\u014bk\u00e1\u0161itku'' N - his female cross-cousin<br>\n''Ha\u014bk\u00e1\u0161iyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n''(S)\u010d\u00e9p\u021fa\u014b\u0161i'' N - my female cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n''(S)\u010d\u00e9p\u021fa\u014b\u0161itku'' N - her female cross-cousin<br>\n''(S)\u010d\u00e9p\u021fa\u014b\u0161iyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n\"\u0161i\u010d'\u00e9\u0161i\" N - my male cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"\u0161i\u010d'\u00e9\u0161itku\" N - her male cross-cousin<br>\n\"\u0161i\u010d'\u00e9\u0161iyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n''Hak\u00e1taku'' N - her brothers and male cross cousins, his sisters and female cross-cousins (i.e. relative requiring respect)<br>\n''Hak\u00e1tayA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a sibling or cross-cousin of the opposite sex\n\n== Learning Lakota: language revitalization efforts ==\n[[File:Kimberly_speaking_Lakota.webm|thumb|Lakota prayer song recorded in 2013]]\nAssimilating indigenous tribes into the expanding American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries depended on suppression or full eradication of each tribe's unique language as the central aspect of its culture. Government boarding schools that separated tribal children from their parents and relatives enforced this assimilation process by corporal punishment for speaking tribal languages (Powers). The Lakota language survived this suppression. \"Lakota persisted through the recognized natural immersion afforded by daily conversation in the home, the community at reservation-wide events, even in texts written in the form of letters to family and friends. people demonstrated their cultural resilience through the positive application of spoken and written Lakota.\" (Powers)\n\nEven so, employment opportunities were based on speaking English; a Lakota who was bilingual or spoke only English was more likely to be hired. (Powers)<ref name=\"Andrews\"/>\n\nSchools on the five Lakota reservation started offering Lakota language classes beginning in the early 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported repeatedly that Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere rote memorization of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).\n\nIn the mid 1970s the situation with Lakota language instruction improved on the Rosebud Reservation where the Lakota Language and Culture department was established at the Sinte Gle\u0161k\u00e1 University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who promoted standardization of orthography and curricula. He employed college level textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat who discontinued the use of the consistent phonemic orthography and the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published an elementary level textbook and promoted it as the only teaching material for schools of all levels in Rosebud. White Hat established his own orthography, one that is very diacritic heavy and impractical. This had a detrimental impact on the quality of instruction in Rosebud and resulted in almost complete disintegration of Lakota language teaching infrastructure in Rosebud, because school boards and administrators gradually lost trust in the effectiveness of Lakota language teachers and classes. By 2015, only one Rosebud school offered Lakota language classes and there were only 2 Lakota language teachers.\n\nLakota language classes continued to be offered between 1970s and 2000s on other Lakota reservations (Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River and Standing Rock), but the three decades did not result in developing any proficiency among students. The situation started improving gradually in the early 2000s when teacher training started to be offered to Lakota language teachers and especially after 2006 when the Lakota Summer Institute was established by the Lakota Language Consortium and the Sitting Bull College on Standing Rock. The institute offers high quality training for Lakota language teachers, educating them in Lakota linguistics and language teaching methodology. Since 2008 the institute also started offering classes for Lakota language learners.\n\nBy 2015, there has been a major improvement of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students for the first time to teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly that students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders. Revitalization efforts were further strengthened by the establishment of several Lakota language immersion schools (such as the Language Nest in Standing Rock and the immersion school in Oglala, Pine Ridge).\n\nOne of the most influential and consistent figures of the Lakota Language Revitalization has been Ben Black Bear, Jr., who established the Lakota Language Department at the S\u012ft\u00e9 Gle\u0161k\u00e1 University in 1970s. Since 2009 he has been teaching Lakota at the Lakota Summer Institute at Sitting Bull College in Standing Rock. He has been a long term board member of the Lakota Language Consortium and he co-authored the Lakota Audio Series and the Lakota Grammar Handbook, which is the most accurate grammar of the language and probably the most detailed grammar ever written for a Native American language.<ref>''Lakota Grammar Handbook'' (2016)</ref>\n\nIn 2004 five Lakota tribes (Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Lower Brule) united with second-language education professionals and academic linguists to form the Lakota Language Consortium,<ref name=\"lakhota.org\"/> to produce and implement a comprehensive educational effort to standardize and professionalize Lakota language teaching in tribal and neighboring public and parochial schools. This intertribal movement has resulted in sequenced textbooks, audio materials, reference books and professional teacher trainings that create a new Lakota-centered career path. In November 2012, the incoming president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Bryan Brewer, announced that he intended \"to lead a Lakota Language Revitalization Initiative that will focus on the creation and operation of Lakota language immersion schools and identifying all fluent Lakota speakers.\"<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Cook\n| first = Andrea\n| title = Brewer pledges to preserve Lakota language\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2012-11-16\n| url = http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/brewer-pledges-to-preserve-lakota-language/article_ae488230-138c-50e6-ab55-55976752169d.html\n}}</ref> A Lakota language immersion daycare center is scheduled to open at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]].<ref>{{Cite news\n |last        = Aaron Moselle\n |title       = Chestnut Hill native looks to revitalize \"eroded\" American Indian language\n |work        = NewsWorks, WHYY\n |accessdate  = 2012-11-29\n |date        = November 2012\n |url         = http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/47231\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130518165344/http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/47231\n |archivedate = 2013-05-18\n}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2012}}, Lakota [[Language immersion|immersion classes]] are provided for children in an experimental program at [[Sitting Bull College]] on the [[Standing Rock Reservation]], where children speak only Lakota for their first year (Powers).<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Donovan\n| first = Lauren\n| title = Learning Lakota, one word at a time\n| work = Bismarck Tribune\n| location = Bismarck, ND\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2012-11-11\n| url = http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/learning-lakota-one-word-at-a-time/article_0352569a-2a97-11e2-9c5c-001a4bcf887a.html\n}}</ref> \n{{As of|2014}}, it is estimated that about five percent of children age four to six on [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] speak Lakota.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Doering\n| first = Christopher\n| title = Indians press for funds to teach Native languages\n| work = Argus Leader\n| accessdate = 2014-06-28\n| date = 2014-06-19\n| url = http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/06/19/indians-press-funds-teach-native-languages/10833145/\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014 Lakota speakers could upload photos with Lakota language audio descriptions at the ''LiveAndTell'' website.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Glader\n| first = Paul\n| title = LiveAndTell, A Crowdsourced Quest To Save Native American Languages | work = Fast Company\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2011-07-04\n| url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1764575/liveandtell-crowdsourced-quest-save-native-american-languages\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liveandtell.com/ |title=LiveAndTell |date=2011-07-08 |access-date=2018-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209100508/http://liveandtell.com/ |archive-date=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Lakota Language Education Program (LLEAP) ===\nIn 2011, Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates, North Dakota, Standing Rock) and the University of South Dakota began degree programs to create effective Lakota language teachers.

At the end of the initial phase, SBC and USD will permanently offer the Lakota Language Teaching and Learning degree as part of their regular undergraduate Education curriculum. The current LLEAP students' tuition and expenses are covered by the grant from the U.S. Department of Education. LLEAP is the first program of its kind, offering courses to create effective teachers in order to save a Native American language from going extinct, and potentially educate the 120,000 prospective Lakota speakers in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Kimberlee | year = 2011 | title = Sitting Bull Offers New Lakota Curriculum | url = | journal = Tribal College Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 69\u201370 }}</ref>\n\n===Government support===\nIn 1990, Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] (D-HI) sponsored the [[Native American Languages Act of 1990|Native American Languages Act]] in order to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedoms of Native people in America to practice, develop and conduct business in their native language.

The voiceless aspirated plosives have two allophonic variants each: those with a delay in voicing {{IPA|([p\u02b0 t\u02b0 k\u02b0])}}, and those with velar friction {{IPA|([p\u02e3 t\u02e3 k\u02e3])}}, which occur before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0129/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0169/}} (thus, {{lang|lkt|lakh\u00f3ta}}, {{IPA|/la\u02c8k\u02b0ota/}} is phonetically {{IPA|[la\u02c8k\u02e3ota]}}). For some speakers, there is a phonemic distinction between the two, and both occur before {{IPA|/e/}}. No such variation occurs for the affricate /t\u0283\u02b0/. Some orthographies mark this distinction; others do not. The uvular fricatives {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} and {{IPA|/\u0281/}} are commonly spelled {{angle bracket|\u021f}} and {{angle bracket|\u01e7}}.\n\nAll [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words have one vowel which carries primary [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and has a higher tone than all other vowels in the word. This is generally the vowel of the second syllable of the word, but often the first syllable can be stressed, and occasionally other syllables as well. Stress is generally indicated with an acute accent: {{angle bracket|\u00e1}}, etc. Compound words will have stressed vowels in each component; proper spelling will write compounds with a hyphen. Thus {{lang|lkt|m\u00e1za-sk\u00e1}}, literally \"metal-white\", i.e. \"silver; money\" has two stressed vowels, the first ''a'' in each component. If it were written without the hyphen, as {{lang|lkt|mazaska}}, it would imply a single main stress.\n\n===Orthography===\nThe majority of educational institutions across Lakota country adopted the writing system of the ''New Lakota Dictionary'' as the standard orthography. It is used, among other places, at [[Sitting Bull College]], Oglala Lakota College, by all schools of the [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]], by the majority of teachers of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and in almost all schools on Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>.

''Y'' has its English value of {{IPA|/j/}}. An apostrophe, \u2019, is used for the [[glottal stop]].\n\nA [[caron]] is used for sounds, other than {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, which are not written with Latin letters in the IPA: ''\u010d'' {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, ''\u01e7'' {{IPA|/\u0281/}}, ''\u021f'' {{IPA|/\u03c7/}}, ''\u0161'' {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, ''\u017e'' {{IPA|/\u0292/}}.

Besides failing to mark stress, this also results in the confusion of numerous consonants: {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}} are both written ''s'', {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} are both written ''h'', and the aspirate stops are written like the unaspirates, as ''p, t, c, k''.\n\n====Alphabet====\n\nStandard Lakota Orthography, as used by the majority of schools, is in principle phonemic, which means that each character ([[grapheme]]) represents one distinctive sound ([[phoneme]]), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration, which is treated phonetically.\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Lakota alphabet\n|-\n!Letter\n!Name of the letter\n!Usual phonetic value ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n|-\n|'''A&nbsp;a'''\n|a\n|{{IPA|[a]}}\n|-\n|'''A\u014b&nbsp;a\u014b'''\n|a\u014b\n|{{IPA|[\u0259\u0303]}}\n|-\n|'''B&nbsp;b'''\n|be\n|{{IPA|[b]}}\n|-\n|'''\u010c&nbsp;\u010d'''\n|\u010du\n|{{IPA|[t\u0283]}}\n|-\n|'''\u010ch&nbsp;\u010dh'''\n|\u010dhi\n|{{IPA|[t\u0283\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''\u010c\u2019&nbsp;\u010d\u2019'''\n|\u010d\u2019\u00f3\n|{{IPA|[t\u0283\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''E&nbsp;e'''\n|e\n|{{IPA|[\u025b]}}\n|-\n|'''G&nbsp;g'''\n|gli\n|{{IPA|[\u0261]}}\n|-\n|'''\u01e6&nbsp;\u01e7'''\n|\u01e7u\n|{{IPA|[\u0281] / [\u0280]}}\n|-\n|'''H&nbsp;h'''\n|ha\n|{{IPA|[h]}}\n|-\n|'''\u021e&nbsp;\u021f'''\n|\u021fe\n|{{IPA|[\u03c7]}}\n|-\n|'''I&nbsp;i'''\n|i\n|{{IPA|[\u026a]}}\n|-\n|'''I\u014b&nbsp;i\u014b'''\n|i\u014b\n|{{IPA|[\u026a\u0303]}}\n|-\n|'''K&nbsp;k'''\n|ku\n|{{IPA|[k]}}\n|-\n|'''Kh&nbsp;kh'''\n|khi\n|{{IPA|[k\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''K\u021f&nbsp;k\u021f'''\n|k\u021fa\n|{{IPA|[k\u02e3]}}\n|-\n|'''K\u2019&nbsp;k\u2019'''\n|k\u2019o\n|{{IPA|[k\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''L&nbsp;l'''\n|la\n|{{IPA|[l]}}\n|-\n|'''M&nbsp;m'''\n|ma\n|{{IPA|[m]}}\n|-\n|'''N&nbsp;n'''\n|na\n|{{IPA|[n]}}\n|-\n|'''O&nbsp;o'''\n|o\n|{{IPA|[\u0254]}}\n|-\n|'''P&nbsp;p'''\n|pu\n|{{IPA|[p]}}\n|-\n|'''Ph&nbsp;ph'''\n|phi\n|{{IPA|[p\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''P\u021f&nbsp;p\u021f'''\n|p\u021fa\n|{{IPA|[p\u02e3]}}\n|-\n|'''P\u2019&nbsp;p\u2019'''\n|p\u2019o\n|{{IPA|[p\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''S&nbsp;s'''\n|sa\n|{{IPA|[s]}}\n|-\n|'''\u0160&nbsp;\u0161'''\n|\u0161e\n|{{IPA|[\u0283]}}\n|-\n|'''T&nbsp;t'''\n|tu\n|{{IPA|[t]}}\n|-\n|'''Th&nbsp;th'''\n|thi\n|{{IPA|[t\u02b0]}}\n|-\n|'''T\u021f&nbsp;t\u021f'''\n|t\u021fa\n|{{IPA|[t\u02e3]}}\n|-\n|'''T\u2019&nbsp;t\u2019'''\n|t\u2019o\n|{{IPA|[t\u02bc]}}\n|-\n|'''U&nbsp;u'''\n|u\n|{{IPA|[\u028a]}}\n|-\n|'''U\u014b&nbsp;u\u014b'''\n|u\u014b\n|{{IPA|[\u028a\u0303]}}\n|-\n|'''W&nbsp;w'''\n|wa\n|{{IPA|[w]}}\n|-\n|'''Y&nbsp;y'''\n|ya\n|{{IPA|[j]}}\n|-\n|'''Z&nbsp;z'''\n|za\n|{{IPA|[z]}}\n|-\n|'''\u017d&nbsp;\u017e'''\n|\u017ee\n|{{IPA|[\u0292]}}\n|-\n|'''\u2019'''\n|kh\u00e9ze\n|{{IPA|[\u0294]}}\n|}{{col-end}}\n\nAll digraphs (i.e. characters created by two letters, such as kh, k\u021f, k\u2019) are treated as groups of individual letters in alphabetization. Thus for example the word {{lang|lkt|\u010dh\u00ed\u014b}} precedes {{lang|lkt|\u010d\u00f3nala}} in a dictionary.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\nA common phonological process which occurs in rapid speech is ''vowel contraction'', which generally results from the loss of an intervocalic glide. Vowel contraction results in phonetic long vowels ([[phoneme|phonemically]] a sequence of two identical vowels), with falling pitch if the first underlying vowel is stressed, and rising pitch if the second underlying vowel is stressed: ''k\u00ea:'' (falling tone), \"he said that\", from {{lang|lkt|k\u00e9ye}}; ''h\u01ce:pi'' (rising tone), \"clothing\", from {{lang|lkt|hay\u00e1pi}}. If one of the vowels is nasalized, the resulting long vowel is also nasalized: ''\u010dha\u014b\u030c:pi'', \"sugar\", from {{lang|lkt|\u010dha\u014bh\u00e1\u014bpi}}.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nWhen two vowels of unequal height contract, or when feature contrasts exist between the vowels and the glide, two new phonetic vowels, {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254\u02d0]}}, result:<ref name=\"rood96\" /> ''iy\u00e6\u0302:'', \"he left for there\", from {{lang|lkt|iy\u00e1ye}}; ''mit\u021fa:'', \"it's mine\", from {{lang|lkt|mit\u021f\u00e1wa}}.\n\nThe plural [[clitic|enclitic]] ''=pi'' is frequently changed in rapid speech when preceding the enclitics ''=kte'', ''=ki\u014b'', ''=k\u0161t\u00f3'', or ''=na''. If the vowel preceding ''=pi'' is high/open, ''=pi'' becomes [u]; if the vowel is non-high (mid or closed), ''=pi'' becomes [o] (if the preceding vowel is nasalized, then the resulting vowel is also nasalized): ''hi=pi=kte'', \"they will arrive here\", [hiukte]; ''yatk\u00e1\u014b=pi=na'', \"they drank it and...\", {{IPA|[jatk\u0259\u0303\u00f5na]}}.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nLakota also exhibits some traces of sound symbolism among fricatives, where the [[point of articulation]] changes to reflect intensity: {{lang|lkt|z\u00ed}}, \"it's yellow\", {{lang|lkt|\u017e\u00ed}}, \"it's tawny\", {{lang|lkt|\u01e7\u00ed}}, \"it's brown\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mithun |first=Marianne |year=2007 |title=The Languages of Native North America|location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=33}}</ref> (Compare with the similar examples in [[Mandan language#Vocabulary|Mandan]].)\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Word order===\n\nThe basic word order of Lakota is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], although the order can be changed for expressive purposes (placing the object before the subject to bring the object into focus or placing the subject after the verb to emphasize its status as established information). It is [[adposition#Postpositions|postpositional]], with adpositions occurring after the head nouns: {{lang|lkt|mas'\u00f3phiye \u00e9l}}, \"at the store\" (literally 'store at'); {{lang|lkt|2=th\u00edpi=ki\u014b \u00f3k\u0161a\u014b}}, \"around the house\" (literally 'house=the around') (Rood and Taylor 1996).\n\nRood and Taylor (1996) suggest the following template for basic word order. Items in parenthesis are optional; only the verb is required. It is therefore possible to produce a grammatical sentence that contains only a verb.\n<blockquote>(interjection) (conjunction) (adverb(s)) (nominal) (nominal) (nominal) (adverb(s)) verb (enclitic(s)) (conjunction)</blockquote>\n\n===Interjections===\n\nWhen [[interjection]]s are used, they begin the sentence or end it. A small number of interjections are used only by one gender, for instance the interjection expressing disbelief is {{lang|lkt|e\u010d\u00e9\u0161}} for women but {{lang|lkt|h\u00f3\u021f}} for men; for calling attention women say {{lang|lkt|m\u00e1\u014b}} while men use {{lang|lkt|w\u00e1\u014b}}. Most interjections, however, are used by both genders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Conjunctions===\n\nIt is common for a sentence to begin with a conjunction. Both {{lang|lkt|\u010dha\u014bk\u00e9}} and {{lang|lkt|yu\u014bk\u021f\u00e1\u014b}} can be translated as ''and''; {{lang|lkt|k\u2019\u00e9ya\u0161}} is similar to English ''but''. Each of these conjunctions joins clauses. In addition, the conjunction {{lang|lkt|na}} joins nouns or phrases.\n\n===Adverbs, postpositions and derived modifiers===\n\nLakota uses [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], which are similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. [[Adverb]]s or postpositional phrases can describe manner, location, or reason. There are also [[interrogative word|interrogative]] adverbs, which are used to form questions. \n\nUllrich (2018) is the first one to show that many words traditionally classified as adverbs actually do not function adverbially and that a better term for these words is 'derived modifiers'. A typical example is the word {{lang|lkt|h\u00e9\u010dhel}}, which is traditionally translated with \"in that way\" but when used with transitive verbs, it always modifies the object argument and not the verb, as in H\u00e9\u010dhel wa\u014bbl\u00e1ke. 'I saw such a thing' (and not * 'In such a way I saw it'). (http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~rrgpage/rrg/Ullrich.pdf)\n\n====Synonymity in the postpositions {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} and {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}}====\n\nTo the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} and {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}} sound like they can be interchangeable, but although they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as locational and directional tools. In the English language they can be compared to prepositions like \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as locatives) on the one hand, and \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as directionals), \"to\", \"into\", and \"onto\", on the other. (Pustet 2013)\n\nA pointer for when to use {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} and when to use {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}} can be determined by the concepts of location  (motionless) or motion; and space vs. time. These features can produce four different combinations, also called semantic domains, which can be arranged as follows (Pustet 2013):\n\n# space / rest: \"in the house\" [th\u00edpi ki\u014b \u00e9l] (This sentence is only describing location of an object, no movement indicated)\n# space / motion: \"to the house [th\u00edpi ki\u014b ekt\u00e1] (This sentence is referring to movement of a subject, it is directional in nature)\n# time / rest: \"in the winter\" [wan\u00edyetu ki\u014b \u00e9l] (This sentence refers to a static moment in time, which happens to be during winter)\n# time / motion: \"in/towards the winter\" [wan\u00edyetu ki\u014b ekt\u00e1] (Pustet 2013) (This sentence is delegated to time, but time which is soon to change to another season)\n\nSummed up, when a context describes no motion, {{lang|lkt|\u00e9l}} is the appropriate postposition; when in motion, {{lang|lkt|ekt\u00e1}} is more appropriate. They are both used in matters of time and space.\n\n===Nouns and pronouns===\n\nAs mentioned above, [[noun phrase|nominals]] are optional in Lakota, but when nouns appear the basic word order is subject\u2013object\u2013verb. Pronouns are not common, but may be used [[contrast (linguistics)|contrastively]] or emphatically.\n\nLakota has four [[article (grammar)|articles]]: {{lang|lkt|wa\u014b}} is indefinite, similar to English ''a'' or ''an'', and {{lang|lkt|ki\u014b}} is definite, similar to English ''the''. In addition, {{lang|lkt|wa\u014b\u017e\u00ed}} is an indefinite article used with hypothetical or [[irrealis mood|irrealis]] objects, and {{lang|lkt|k\u2019u\u014b}} is a definite article used with nouns that have been mentioned previously.\n\n===Demonstratives===\n\nThere are also nine [[demonstrative]]s, which can function either as pronouns or as [[determiner (class)|determiners]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| \n! colspan=3 | Distance from speaker\n|-\n| \n!'''near the speaker'''\n!'''near the listener'''\n!'''away from the listener'''\n|-\n\n| '''singular''' || {{lang|lkt|l\u00e9}} || {{lang|lkt|h\u00e9}} || {{lang|lkt|k\u00e1}}\n|-\n| '''dual''' || {{lang|lkt|len\u00e1os}} || {{lang|lkt|hen\u00e1os}} || {{lang|lkt|kan\u00e1os}} \n|-\n| '''plural''' || {{lang|lkt|len\u00e1}} || {{lang|lkt|hen\u00e1}} || {{lang|lkt|kan\u00e1}}\n|}\n\nIn traditional grammars, the three groups of demonstratives are described as pointing to objects \"near\", \"neutral distance\" and \"far\", but New Lakota Dictionary (Second Edition, 2012) is the first publication to show that the choice of demonstratives is in fact based on the position respective to the speaker and the listener, and that the {{lang|lkt|k\u00e1}} series refer to objects away from both the speaker and listener.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nVerbs are the only word class that are obligatory in a Lakota sentence. Verbs can be active, naming an action, or [[Stative verb|stative]], describing a property. (Note that in English, such descriptions are usually made with [[adjective]]s.)\n\nVerbs are [[Inflection|inflected]] for first-, second- or third [[Grammatical person|person]], and for singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] or plural [[grammatical number]].\n\n===Morphology===\n\n====Verb inflection====\n\nThere are two paradigms for verb [[inflection]]. One set of [[morpheme]]s indicates the [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of active verbs. The other set of morphemes [[Agreement (linguistics)|agrees]] with the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[Transitive verb|transitive]] action verbs ''or'' the subject of stative verbs.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nMost of the morphemes in each paradigm are prefixes, but plural subjects are marked with a suffix and third-person plural objects with an [[infix]].\n\nFirst person arguments may be singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], or plural; second or third person arguments may be singular or plural.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Subject of active verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || wa- || u\u014b(k)- || u\u014b(k)- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ya- ||  || ya- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''[[Markedness|unmarked]]'' ||  || -pi\n|}\n\n'''Examples:''' ''m\u00e1ni'' \"He walks.\" ''m\u00e1nipi'' \"They walk.\"\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Subject of stative verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || ma- || u\u014b(k)- || u\u014b(k)- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ni- ||  || ni- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''unmarked'' ||  || -pi\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Object of transitive verbs\n| \n|'''singular'''\n|'''dual'''\n|'''plural'''\n|-\n| '''first person''' || ma- ||  || u\u014b(k)- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''second person''' || ni- ||  || ni- \u2026 -pi\n|-\n| '''third person''' || ''unmarked'' ||  || -wicha-\n|}\n\n'''Example:''' ''wa\u014bw\u00ed\u010dhaya\u014bke'' \"He looked at them\" from ''wa\u014by\u00e1\u014bkA'' \"to look at something/somebody\".\n\n'''Subject and object pronouns in one verb'''<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br/>\nIf both the subject and object need to be marked, two affixes occur on the verb. Below is a table illustrating this. Subject affixes are marked in ''italics'' and object affixes are marked in <u>underline</u>. Some affixes encompass both subject and object (such as ''\u010dhi''- ...). The symbol '''\u2205''' indicates a lack of marking for a particular subject/object (as in the case of 3rd Person Singular forms). Cells with three forms indicate Class I, Class II, and Class III verb forms in this order.\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''<u>me</u>'''\n|'''<u>you (sg.)</u>'''\n|'''<u>him/her/it; them (inanimate)</u>'''\n|'''<u>us</u>'''\n|'''<u>you (pl.)</u>'''\n|'''<u>them (animate)</u>'''\n|-\n| '''''I''''' || || ''\u010dhi''-<sup>1</sup> ... || ''wa''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''bl''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''m''<u>\u2205</u>- ... ||  || ''\u010dhi''- ... -<u>pi</u> || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''wa''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''bl''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''m''- ...\n|-\n| '''''you (sg.)''''' || <u>ma</u>''ya''- ...<br><u>ma</u>''yal''-<sup>2</sup> ...<br><u>ma</u>''yan''- ... || || ''ya''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''l''<u>\u2205</u>- ...<br>''n''<u>\u2205</u>- ... || <u>u\u014b</u>''ya''- ... -<u>pi</u><br><u>u\u014b</u>''l''- ... -<u>pi</u><br><u>u\u014b</u>''n''- ... -<u>pi</u> || || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''ya''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''l''- ...<br><u>wi\u010dha</u>''n''- ...\n|-\n| '''''he/she/it''''' || <u>ma</u>''\u2205''- ... || <u>ni</u>''\u2205''- ... || <u>\u2205</u>''\u2205''- ... || <u>u\u014b(k)</u>''\u2205''- ... -<u>pi</u> || <u>ni</u>''\u2205''- ... -<u>pi</u> || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''\u2205''- ...\n|-\n| '''''we''''' || || ''u\u014b''<u>ni</u>-<sup>3</sup> ... -''pi'' || ''u\u014b(k)''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi'' || || ''u\u014b''<u>ni</u>- ... -''<u>pi</u>'' || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''u\u014b(k)''-<sup>4</sup> ... -''pi''\n|-\n| '''''you (pl.)''''' || <u>ma</u>''ya''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>ma</u>''yal''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>ma</u>''yan''- ... -''pi'' || || ''ya''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi''<br> ''l''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi''<br> ''n''<u>\u2205</u>- ... -''pi'' || <u>u\u014b</u>''ya''- ... -''<u>pi</u>''<sup>5</sup><br>  <u>u\u014b</u>''l''- ... -''<u>pi</u>''<br>  <u>u\u014b</u>''n''- ... -''<u>pi</u>'' || || <u>wi\u010dha</u>''ya''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>wi\u010dha</u>''l''- ... -''pi''<br> <u>wi\u010dha</u>''n''- ... -''pi''\n|-\n| '''''they''''' || <u>ma</u>- ... -''pi'' || <u>ni</u>- ... -''pi'' || ... -<u>\u2205</u>''pi'' || <u>u\u014b</u>- ... -''<u>pi</u>'' || <u>ni</u>- ... -''pi'' || <u>wi\u010dha</u>- ... -''pi''\n|}\n\n*<sup>1</sup> The affix ''\u010dhi''- covers cases where I-subject and you-object occurs in transitive verbs.\n*<sup>2</sup> Class II and Class III verbs have irregular ''yal''- and ''yan''- respectively.\n*<sup>3</sup> These prefixes are separated when ''u\u014b(k)''- must be prefixed while ''ni''- et al. must be infixed.\n'''Example:''' '''''u\u014bk'''\u00e1'''ni'''p\u021fepi'' \"We are waiting for you\" from ''ap\u021f\u00e9'' \"to wait for somebody\".\n*<sup>4</sup> ''u\u014b(k)''- precedes all affixes except ''wi\u010dha''-. In the last column, verbs which require ''u\u014b(k)''- to be prefixed are more complex because of competing rules: ''u\u014b(k)''- must be prefixed, but must also follow ''wi\u010dha''-. Most speakers resolve this issue by infixing ''wi\u010dhau\u014b(k)'' after the initial vowel, then repeating the initial vowel again.\n'''Example:''' ''i'''w\u00ed\u010dhau\u014bk'''i\u010du'''pi''''' \"We took them\" from ''i\u010d\u00fa'' \"to take something/somebody\".\n*<sup>5</sup> Since the suffix -''pi'' can appear only once in each verb, but may pluralize either subject or object (or both), some ambiguity exists in the forms: ''u\u014b- ... -pi'', ''u\u014bni- ... -pi'', and ''u\u014bya-/u\u014bl-/u\u014bn- ... -pi''.\n\n====Enclitics====\n\nLakota has a number of [[enclitic]] [[Grammatical particle|particles]] which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.\n\nSome enclitics indicate the aspect, mood, or number of the verb they follow. There are also various [[interrogative]] enclitics, which in addition to marking an utterance as a question show finer distinctions of meaning. For example, while ''he'' is the usual question-marking enclitic, ''hu\u014bw\u00f3'' is used for [[rhetorical question]]s or in formal [[Public speaking|oratory]], and the [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] ''wa'' functions somewhat like a [[tag question]] in English (Rood and Taylor 1996; Buchel 1983). (See also the section below on men and women's speech.)\n\n=====Men's and women's speech=====\nA small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. ''Yel\u00f3'' (men) ''ye'' (women) mark mild assertions. ''K\u0161t\u00f3'' (women only according to most sources) marks strong assertion. ''Yo'' (men) and ''ye'' (women) mark neutral commands, ''yet\u021f\u00f3'' (men) and ''nit\u021f\u00f3'' (women) mark familiar, and ''ye'' (both men and women) and ''na'' mark requests. ''He'' is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use ''h\u0173w\u00f3'' in more formal situations. ''So'' (men) and ''se'' (women) mark [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).\n\nWhile many [[First language|native speakers]] and [[Linguistics|linguists]] agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular [[gender]]s, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa (Trechter 1999).\n\n'''Examples of enclitic usage'''\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Enclitic'''\n|'''Meaning'''\n|'''Example'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Deloria |first=Ella |year=1932 |title=Dakota Texts|location=New York|publisher=G.E.

Compare these sentences.\n\n''\u0160\u00fa\u014bka ki\u014b s\u00e1pa \u010dha wa\u014bbl\u00e1ke.'' <br />\n''\u0160\u00fa\u014bka ki\u014b s\u00e1pe.'' <br />\n''\u0160\u00fa\u014bka ki\u014b s\u00e1pi\u014b na t\u021f\u00e1\u014bka.''\n\nThe last vowel in the word \"''S\u00e1pA''\" changed each time. This vowel change is called \"ablaut\". Words which undergo this change are referred to as A-words, since, in dictionary citations, they are written ending in either -A or -A\u014b. These words are never written with a final capital letter in actual texts. Derivatives of these words generally take the ablaut as well, however there are exceptions.\n\nThere are three forms for ablauted words: ''-a/-a\u014b'', ''-e'', ''-i\u014b''. These are referred to as a/a\u014b-ablaut, e-ablaut, and i\u014b-ablaut respectively. Some words are ablauted by some and not others, like \"gray\" ''h\u00f3ta'' or ''h\u00f3tA''. Ablaut always depends on what word follows the ablauted word.\n\n====A/a\u014b-ablaut====\n\nThis is the basic form of the word, and is used everywhere in which the other forms are not utilized.\n\n====E-ablaut====\n\nThere are two cases in which e-ablaut is used.\n# Last word in the sentence\n# Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut\n\n=====1. Last word in sentence=====\n;Examples\n\n:''H\u00e9\u010dhiya y\u00e9'' He went there. (e-ablaut of the verb ''y\u00c1'')\n:''Y\u00fate'' She ate it. (e-ablaut of the verb ''y\u00fatA'')\n:''Th\u00edpi ki\u014b pah\u00e1 ak\u00e1\u014bl h\u00e9.'' The house stands on a cliff. (e-ablaut of the verb ''h\u00c1\u014b'')\n\n=====2. Followed by a word which triggers e-ablaut=====\nThere are three classes of words which trigger e-ablaut\n\na) various enclitics, such as ''\u021f\u010da, \u021f\u010di\u014b, i\u014b\u010dh\u00e9ye, ka\u010dh\u00e1\u0161, kil\u00f3, k\u0161t\u00f3, kt\u00f3k, lak\u021fa, -la, l\u00e1\u021f, l\u00e1\u021f\u010daka, l\u00f3, s\u00e9\u010dA, s\u00e9kse, s\u2019el\u00e9\u010dhe\u010da, so, s\u2019a, s\u2019e, \u0161a\u014b, \u0161ni, u\u014b\u0161t\u00f3''<br />\nb) some conjunctions and articles, such as ''ki\u014b, ki\u014bh\u00e1\u014b, k\u2019\u00e9a\u0161, k\u2019u\u014b, eh\u00e1\u014bta\u014b\u0161''<br />\nc) some auxiliary verbs, such as ''kap\u00ed\u014b, kin\u00ed\u010da (kin\u00edl), lakA (la), k\u00fa\u014bzA, phi\u010da, \u0161i, wa\u010dh\u00ed\u014b, -yA, -khiyA''<br />\n\n;Examples\n\n:''\u0160k\u00e1te \u0161ni.''

(auxiliary verb)\n\n====I\u014b-ablaut====\n\nThe ''i\u014b''-ablaut (pronounced ''i'' by some) occurs only before the following words:\n\n''ktA'' (irrealis enclitic)<br />\n''yet\u021f\u00f3'' (familiar command enclitic)<br />\n''na, nah\u00e1\u014b'' (and)<br />\n''na\u00ed\u014b\u0161'' (or, and or)<br />\n''y\u00e9'' (polite request or entreaty enclitic)\n\n;Examples\n\n:''Wa\u014by\u00e1\u014bki\u014b yet\u021f\u00f3.''

Please, look at it.\n\n==Phrases==\n\n\"''H\u00e1u k\u021fol\u00e1''\", literally \"Hello, friend\", is the most common greeting, and was transformed into the generic motion picture American Indian \"[[How (greeting)|How]]!\", just as the traditional feathered headdress of the Teton was \"given\" to all movie Indians. As ''h\u00e1u'' is the only word in Lakota which contains a [[diphthong]], {{IPA|/au/}}, it may be a loanword from a non-Siouan language.<ref name=\"rood96\" />\n\nOther than using the word \"friend\", one often uses the word \"cousin\" or \"cross-cousin\" since everyone in the tribe was as family to each other. These words are very important to the speaker's tone of proper respect. The terms are as follow:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n''T\u021fa\u014bh\u00e1\u014b\u0161i'' N - my male cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n''T\u021fa\u014bh\u00e1\u014b\u0161itku'' N - his male cross-cousin<br>\n''T\u021fa\u014bh\u00e1\u014b\u0161iyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n''Ha\u014bk\u00e1\u0161i'' N - my female cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n''Ha\u014bk\u00e1\u0161itku'' N - his female cross-cousin<br>\n''Ha\u014bk\u00e1\u0161iyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n''(S)\u010d\u00e9p\u021fa\u014b\u0161i'' N - my female cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n''(S)\u010d\u00e9p\u021fa\u014b\u0161itku'' N - her female cross-cousin<br>\n''(S)\u010d\u00e9p\u021fa\u014b\u0161iyA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n\"\u0161i\u010d'\u00e9\u0161i\" N - my male cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"\u0161i\u010d'\u00e9\u0161itku\" N - her male cross-cousin<br>\n\"\u0161i\u010d'\u00e9\u0161iyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n''Hak\u00e1taku'' N - her brothers and male cross cousins, his sisters and female cross-cousins (i.e. relative requiring respect)<br>\n''Hak\u00e1tayA'' V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a sibling or cross-cousin of the opposite sex\n\n== Learning Lakota: language revitalization efforts ==\n[[File:Kimberly_speaking_Lakota.webm|thumb|Lakota prayer song recorded in 2013]]\nAssimilating indigenous tribes into the expanding American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries depended on suppression or full eradication of each tribe's unique language as the central aspect of its culture. Government boarding schools that separated tribal children from their parents and relatives enforced this assimilation process by corporal punishment for speaking tribal languages (Powers). The Lakota language survived this suppression. \"Lakota persisted through the recognized natural immersion afforded by daily conversation in the home, the community at reservation-wide events, even in texts written in the form of letters to family and friends. people demonstrated their cultural resilience through the positive application of spoken and written Lakota.\" (Powers)\n\nEven so, employment opportunities were based on speaking English; a Lakota who was bilingual or spoke only English was more likely to be hired. (Powers)<ref name=\"Andrews\"/>\n\nSchools on the five Lakota reservation started offering Lakota language classes beginning in the early 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported repeatedly that Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere rote memorization of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).\n\nIn the mid 1970s the situation with Lakota language instruction improved on the Rosebud Reservation where the Lakota Language and Culture department was established at the Sinte Gle\u0161k\u00e1 University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who promoted standardization of orthography and curricula. He employed college level textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat who discontinued the use of the consistent phonemic orthography and the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published an elementary level textbook and promoted it as the only teaching material for schools of all levels in Rosebud. White Hat established his own orthography, one that is very diacritic heavy and impractical. This had a detrimental impact on the quality of instruction in Rosebud and resulted in almost complete disintegration of Lakota language teaching infrastructure in Rosebud, because school boards and administrators gradually lost trust in the effectiveness of Lakota language teachers and classes. By 2015, only one Rosebud school offered Lakota language classes and there were only 2 Lakota language teachers.\n\nLakota language classes continued to be offered between 1970s and 2000s on other Lakota reservations (Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River and Standing Rock), but the three decades did not result in developing any proficiency among students. The situation started improving gradually in early 2000\u2019s when teacher training started to be offered to Lakota language teachers and especially after 2006 when the Lakota Summer Institute was established by the Lakota Language Consortium and the Sitting Bull College on Standing Rock. The institute offers high quality training for Lakota language teachers, educating them in Lakota linguistics and language teaching methodology. Since 2008 the institute also started offering classes for Lakota language learners.\n\nBy 2015, there has been a major improvement of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students for the first time to teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly that students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders. Revitalization efforts were further strengthened by the establishment of several Lakota language immersion schools (such as the Language Nest in Standing Rock and the immersion school in Oglala, Pine Ridge).\n\nOne of the most influential and consistent figures of the Lakota Language Revitalization has been Ben Black Bear, Jr., who established the Lakota Language Department at the S\u012ft\u00e9 Gle\u0161k\u00e1 University in 1970s. Since 2009 he has been teaching Lakota at the Lakota Summer Institute at Sitting Bull College in Standing Rock. He has been a long term board member of the Lakota Language Consortium and he co-authored the Lakota Audio Series and the Lakota Grammar Handbook, which is the most accurate grammar of the language and probably the most detailed grammar ever written for a Native American language.<ref>''Lakota Grammar Handbook'' (2016)</ref>\n\nIn 2004 five Lakota tribes (Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Lower Brule) united with second-language education professionals and academic linguists to form the Lakota Language Consortium,<ref name=\"lakhota.org\"/> to produce and implement a comprehensive educational effort to standardize and professionalize Lakota language teaching in tribal and neighboring public and parochial schools. This intertribal movement has resulted in sequenced textbooks, audio materials, reference books and professional teacher trainings that create a new Lakota-centered career path. In November 2012, the incoming president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Bryan Brewer, announced that he intended \"to lead a Lakota Language Revitalization Initiative that will focus on the creation and operation of Lakota language immersion schools and identifying all fluent Lakota speakers.\"<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Cook\n| first = Andrea\n| title = Brewer pledges to preserve Lakota language\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2012-11-16\n| url = http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/brewer-pledges-to-preserve-lakota-language/article_ae488230-138c-50e6-ab55-55976752169d.html\n}}</ref> A Lakota language immersion daycare center is scheduled to open at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation|Pine Ridge]].<ref>{{Cite news\n |last        = Aaron Moselle\n |title       = Chestnut Hill native looks to revitalize \"eroded\" American Indian language\n |work        = NewsWorks, WHYY\n |accessdate  = 2012-11-29\n |date        = November 2012\n |url         = http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/47231\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130518165344/http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/47231\n |archivedate = 2013-05-18\n}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2012}}, Lakota [[Language immersion|immersion classes]] are provided for children in an experimental program at [[Sitting Bull College]] on the [[Standing Rock Reservation]], where children speak only Lakota for their first year (Powers).<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Donovan\n| first = Lauren\n| title = Learning Lakota, one word at a time\n| work = Bismarck Tribune\n| location = Bismarck, ND\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2012-11-11\n| url = http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/learning-lakota-one-word-at-a-time/article_0352569a-2a97-11e2-9c5c-001a4bcf887a.html\n}}</ref> \n{{As of|2014}}, it is estimated that about five percent of children age four to six on [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] speak Lakota.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Doering\n| first = Christopher\n| title = Indians press for funds to teach Native languages\n| work = Argus Leader\n| accessdate = 2014-06-28\n| date = 2014-06-19\n| url = http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2014/06/19/indians-press-funds-teach-native-languages/10833145/\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014 Lakota speakers could upload photos with Lakota language audio descriptions at the ''LiveAndTell'' website.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Glader\n| first = Paul\n| title = LiveAndTell, A Crowdsourced Quest To Save Native American Languages | work = Fast Company\n| accessdate = 2012-11-20\n| date = 2011-07-04\n| url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1764575/liveandtell-crowdsourced-quest-save-native-american-languages\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liveandtell.com/ |title=LiveAndTell |date=2011-07-08 |access-date=2018-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209100508/http://liveandtell.com/ |archive-date=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Lakota Language Education Program (LLEAP) ===\nIn 2011, Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates, North Dakota, Standing Rock) and the University of South Dakota began degree programs to create effective Lakota language teachers.

At the end of the initial phase, SBC and USD will permanently offer the Lakota Language Teaching and Learning degree as part of their regular undergraduate Education curriculum. The current LLEAP students' tuition and expenses are covered by the grant from the U.S. Department of Education. LLEAP is the first program of its kind, offering courses to create effective teachers in order to save a Native American language from going extinct, and potentially educate the 120,000 prospective Lakota speakers in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Kimberlee | year = 2011 | title = Sitting Bull Offers New Lakota Curriculum | url = | journal = Tribal College Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 69\u201370 }}</ref>\n\n===Government support===\nIn 1990, Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] (D-HI) sponsored the [[Native American Languages Act of 1990|Native American Languages Act]] in order to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedoms of Native people in America to practice, develop and conduct business in their native language.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly scattered in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Every phone call after their first to Art, removes money from the pot for receiving a hint. The candidates are unaware each duo is in a different country.

With a \u20ac1,000.- note and a photograph, the group must find the vendor in the photo to exchange their note for two \u20ac500.- notes and a new photograph of the next vendor with money. The candidates have 30 minutes to exchange their money and staple to the board to cover the negative money.\n\nDespite the wind blowing off the money immediately after the time limit was up, the production was gracious and totalled up the full amount including the blown off notes.\n\nThe group earned \u20ac860.- for the pot.\n\n'''Aanschuiven (Joining In) - Max. \u20ac2,000.-'''\nAttending a performance of Julius Caesar at the Rustaveli Theatre, the candidates were separated into spectator boxes in the wings of the theatre.

In the middle of the assignment, Ron, the first candidate executed in the game back in Moscow, texted the group that he was attending the play with them. He held crucial information for the upcoming test, and if any of the candidates were to join him in his box within the next ten minutes, he would share that knowledge and re-enter the game.\n\nThe candidates, including Ron's starting partner Loes, stopped each other from meeting with Ron, sending him home at the end of the assignment.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment as well, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Opscheppen (Shovel) - Max. \u20ac3,000.-'''\nUsing heavy machinery, the candidates excavate dirt in order to drive a Lada car along a path in a construction yard.

The remaining four candidates were dropped off in Tbilisi and instructed to find where the three missing candidates were hidden underground. The Underground candidates have no idea where they have been hidden, but hold the information in which the Searchers could use to find them. The underground candidates were hidden in a tunnel maze, where throughout the tunnels they could find simple instructions and photographs of where the Searchers had to go in order to receive new instructions.

With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park.

On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly split across 5 different countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine) for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

The remaining four candidates were dropped off in Tbilisi and instructed to find where the three missing candidates were hidden underground. The Underground candidates have no idea where they have been hidden, but hold the information in which the Searchers could use to find them. The underground candidates were hidden in a tunnel maze, where throughout the tunnels they could find simple instructions and photographs of where the Searchers had to go in order to receive new instructions. The Underground candidate's phone could only receive signal at a small opening far from the instructions board in the maze. With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park.

On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route.

During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-.

He played as an [[outfielder]] and [[designated hitter]] in [[Major League Baseball]] from {{mlby|1981}} to {{mlby|1999}} for the [[San Francisco Giants]] (1981\u201387), [[California Angels]] (1988\u201390, 1993\u201396), [[Minnesota Twins]] (1991\u201392), [[Kansas City Royals]] (1997) and [[New York Yankees]] (1998\u201399). His first Major League coaching position after his playing career was with the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 2012 to 2014. He also coached for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Chicago Cubs]]. He is currently the hitting coach for the [[New York Mets]]. Davis was a [[switch-hitter]] and threw right-handed. He is the [[List of countries with their first Major League Baseball player|first ballplayer born in Jamaica to appear in a Major League game]].\n\n==Amateur career==\nBorn in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], Davis moved with his three brothers and sister to Los Angeles at the age of 10. Davis originally attended [[John C. Fremont High School|Fremont High School]] before transferring to [[Susan Miller Dorsey High School]] in Los Angeles. In high school, Davis played [[catcher]] and [[first base]]. Prior to his first year in the minor leagues, Davis was exclusively a right-handed hitter.<ref>http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/f842dfbd</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nIn a 19-year career, Davis was a .274 hitter with 350 [[home run]]s and 1,372 [[runs batted in|RBI]] in 2,436 [[games played|games]].\n\n[[Image:1985 Mother's Cookies - Chili Davis.JPG|thumb|left|Davis batting for the Giants in 1985]]\nDavis was an [[outfielder]] developed in the Giants [[minor league baseball|minors]] system. In his first regular season in 1982, he hit .261 with 19 HR, 76 RBI and 24 [[stolen base]]s, and also led all [[National League]] outfielders in [[assist (baseball)|assists]]. In 1984 Davis finished third in NL [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.315), behind [[Tony Gwynn]] (.351) and [[Lee Lacy]] (.321). When he led the league in fielding [[error (baseball statistics)|errors]] in 1986, his nine errors tied the major league record for fewest errors by a category leader. After seven seasons in San Francisco, including two [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances in 1984 and 1986, Davis signed with the Angels as a [[free agent]] before the 1988 season.\n\nIn his first two years with California, Davis hit 21 HR and 93 RBI in 1988, and then 22 HR and 90 RBI in 1989. In 1990, hampered by chronic back problems and defensive shortcomings, Davis moved from full-time outfield duty to a DH role. After signing with Minnesota the following year, Davis remained a DH and would do so for the rest of his career.\n\nDavis contributed to the Twins with his switch-hitting ability, as the Twins' lineup already possessed right-handed batting [[Kirby Puckett]] and left-handed batting [[Kent Hrbek]]. Though he hit well from both sides of the plate, Davis performed better from the left side, as many switch hitters do as a result of facing more right-handed pitching. In 1991 he led the Twins in home runs (29), RBI (93), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (34), [[base on balls|walks]] (95), intentional walks (13), [[times on base]] (244), pitches seen (2,469), [[games played]] (153), [[slugging average]] (.507), [[on-base percentage]] (.385), [[on-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.892), home run frequency (18.4 [[at bat]] per HR), and most pitches seen per plate appearance (3.89). With these numbers, Davis helped Minnesota rise from a last-place finish the previous year to the [[American League|AL West title]]. In the [[1991 World Series]], in which he hit two home runs, Davis and the Twins defeated the [[Atlanta Braves]] in seven games. Davis declined in production in 1992 (12 HR and 66 RBI), and as a free agent the following year returned to the Angels.\n\nDavis provided four years of solid production for California, including 27 HR and a career-high 112 RBI in 1993. In 1994, he hit .311, with 26 HR and 84 RBI, and appeared in the All-Star game in the strike-shortened 1994 season.  In 1995, he hit .318 with 20 HR and 86 RBI, and in 1996 hit .292, 28 HR and 96 RBI. In 1997 he was traded to Kansas City for [[starting pitcher|starter]] [[Mark Gubicza]]. In his one year with the Royals, Davis hit .279 with 90 RBI and a career-high 30 HR. Davis spent his final two seasons with the Yankees, winning his second and third [[World Series ring]]s.  He finished his career in 1999 hitting .269 with 19 HR and 78 RBI.\n\nDavis finished his career with 350 home runs. That total ranks seventh all-time in home runs by a switch hitter, following [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Eddie Murray]], [[Chipper Jones]], [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] and [[Lance Berkman]]. Eleven times, Davis hit a home run from both sides of the plate in the same game and finished his career tied with Eddie Murray for first in this category, which has since been broken by Mark Teixeira, [[Nick Swisher]] and Carlos Beltr\u00e1n.\n\nDavis played in the outfield from 1981 to 1989. By 1990, he started to see more time as [[designated hitter]] in the [[American League]]. In 1993 he appeared as a pitcher for the only time in his career, pitching the final 2 innings of a game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. He faced 7 batters, while allowing no runs, no hits, and surrendering no walks. However he did hit batter [[Jose Canseco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-18/sports/sp-4283_1_chili-davis |title=Chili Cooly Shuts Down Rangers: Angels: However, Davis' two-inning stint comes after 18 Texas runs |author=Scott Miller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 18, 1993 |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420235602/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-18/sports/sp-4283_1_chili-davis |archivedate=April 20, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Davis was specifically a designated hitter from 1995 to 1999, and did not log any innings played in the field the final five seasons of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davisch01.shtml |title=Chili Davis |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408205712/http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davisch01.shtml |archivedate=April 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Breakout performances===\n[[File:Chili Davis 1996.jpg|thumb|Davis with the Angels in 1996]]\n*On August 2, 1984, Chili Davis went a perfect 4-for-4 outdoing his teammates who only combined for three hits as the San Francisco Giants found a way to get past the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 5-2.

He played as an [[outfielder]] and [[designated hitter]] in [[Major League Baseball]] from {{mlby|1981}} to {{mlby|1999}} for the [[San Francisco Giants]] (1981\u201387), [[California Angels]] (1988\u201390, 1993\u201396), [[Minnesota Twins]] (1991\u201392), [[Kansas City Royals]] (1997) and the [[New York Yankees]] (1998\u201399). His first major league coaching position after his playing career was with the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 2012 to 2014. He also coached for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Chicago Cubs]]. He is currently the hitting coach for the [[New York Mets]]. Davis was a [[switch-hitter]] and threw right-handed. He is the [[List of countries with their first Major League Baseball player|first ballplayer born in Jamaica to appear in a major league game]].\n\n==Amateur career==\nBorn in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], Davis moved with his three brothers and sister to Los Angeles at the age of ten. Davis originally attended [[John C. Fremont High School|Fremont High School]] before transferring to [[Susan Miller Dorsey High School]] in Los Angeles. In high school, Davis played [[catcher]] and [[first base]]. Prior to his first year in the minor leagues, Davis was exclusively a right-handed hitter.<ref>http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/f842dfbd</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nIn a 19-year career, Davis was a .274 hitter with 350 [[home run]]s and 1,372 [[runs batted in|RBI]] in 2,436 [[games played|games]].\n\n[[Image:1985 Mother's Cookies - Chili Davis.JPG|thumb|left|Davis batting for the Giants in 1985]]\nDavis was an [[outfielder]] developed in the Giants [[minor league baseball|minors]] system. In his first regular season in 1982, he hit .261 with 19 HR, 76 RBI and 24 [[stolen base]]s, and also led all [[National League]] outfielders in [[assist (baseball)|assists]]. In 1984 Davis finished third in NL [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (.315), behind [[Tony Gwynn]] (.351) and [[Lee Lacy]] (.321). When he led the league in fielding [[error (baseball statistics)|errors]] in 1986, his nine errors tied the major league record for fewest errors by a category leader. After seven seasons in San Francisco, including two [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances in 1984 and 1986, Davis signed with the Angels as a [[free agent]] before the 1988 season.\n\nIn his first two years with California, Davis hit 21 HR and 93 RBI in 1988, and then 22 HR and 90 RBI in 1989. In 1990, hampered by chronic back problems and defensive shortcomings, Davis moved from full-time outfield duty to a DH role. After signing with Minnesota the following year, Davis remained a DH and would do so for the rest of his career.\n\nDavis contributed to the Twins with his switch-hitting ability, as the Twins' lineup already possessed right-handed batting [[Kirby Puckett]] and left-handed batting [[Kent Hrbek]]. Though he hit well from both sides of the plate, Davis performed better from the left side, as many switch hitters do as a result of facing more right-handed pitching. In 1991 he led the Twins in home runs (29), RBI (93), [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (34), [[base on balls|walks]] (95), intentional walks (13), [[times on base]] (244), pitches seen (2,469), [[games played]] (153), [[slugging average]] (.507), [[on-base percentage]] (.385), [[on-base plus slugging|OPS]] (.892), home run frequency (18.4 [[at bat]] per HR), and most pitches seen per plate appearance (3.89). With these numbers, Davis helped Minnesota rise from a last-place finish the previous year to the [[American League|AL West title]]. In the [[1991 World Series]], in which he hit two home runs, Davis and the Twins defeated the [[Atlanta Braves]] in seven games. Davis declined in production in 1992 (12 HR and 66 RBI), and as a free agent the following year returned to the Angels.\n\nDavis provided four years of solid production for California, including 27 HR and a career-high 112 RBI in 1993. In 1994, he hit .311, with 26 HR and 84 RBI, and appeared in the All-Star game in the strike-shortened 1994 season.  In 1995, he hit .318 with 20 HR and 86 RBI, and in 1996 hit .292, 28 HR and 96 RBI. In 1997 he was traded to Kansas City for [[starting pitcher|starter]] [[Mark Gubicza]]. In his one year with the Royals, Davis hit .279 with 90 RBI and a career-high 30 HR. Davis spent his final two seasons with the Yankees, winning his second and third [[World Series ring]]s.  He finished his career in 1999 hitting .269 with 19 HR and 78 RBI.\n\nDavis finished his career with 350 home runs. That total ranks seventh all-time in home runs by a switch hitter, following [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Eddie Murray]], [[Chipper Jones]], [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] and [[Lance Berkman]]. Eleven times, Davis hit a home run from both sides of the plate in the same game and finished his career tied with Eddie Murray for first in this category, which has since been broken by Mark Teixeira, [[Nick Swisher]] and Carlos Beltr\u00e1n.\n\nDavis played in the outfield from 1981 to 1989. By 1990, he started to see more time as [[designated hitter]] in the [[American League]]. In 1993 he appeared as a pitcher for the only time in his career, pitching the final 2 innings of a game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. He faced 7 batters, while allowing no runs, no hits, and surrendering no walks. However he did hit batter [[Jose Canseco]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-18/sports/sp-4283_1_chili-davis |title=Chili Cooly Shuts Down Rangers: Angels: However, Davis' two-inning stint comes after 18 Texas runs |author=Scott Miller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 18, 1993 |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420235602/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-18/sports/sp-4283_1_chili-davis |archivedate=April 20, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Davis was specifically a designated hitter from 1995 to 1999, and did not log any innings played in the field the final five seasons of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davisch01.shtml |title=Chili Davis |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408205712/http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davisch01.shtml |archivedate=April 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Breakout performances===\n[[File:Chili Davis 1996.jpg|thumb|Davis with the Angels in 1996]]\n*On August 2, 1984, Chili Davis went a perfect 4-for-4 outdoing his teammates who only combined for three hits as the San Francisco Giants found a way to get past the [[Cincinnati Reds]], 5-2.
