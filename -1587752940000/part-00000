The five main areas of concern are:\n\n* What is the annual attendance of the fair?\n* What economic impact does the fair have on people and businesses in the surrounding area?\n* How much money does the State Fair provide for the benefit of improvements at [[Fair Park]] and elsewhere\n* State fair staff compensation levels\n* Audits\n\n===Attendance===\n\nStaff of the State Fair have traditionally reported that attendance at the fair runs in the vicinity each year of between 3 and 3.5 million people. These figures were disputed in an April 2016 study published by Tom Kelly, Ph.D, a professor of Economics at [[Baylor University]] and the Director of Baylor University Center for Business and Economic Research, along with Bennet Hickok, an Economics student at Baylor. The Kelly/Hickok report argues that the attendance at the fair is about 1.5-1.7 million visitors a year, or about half of what state fair staff reported it to be.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Tom|last2=Hickok|first2=Bennet|title=Reassessing the Economic Impact of Fair Park and the State Fair|url=http://www.baylor.edu/business/economic_research/doc.php/262623.pdf|accessdate=27 July 2016|publisher=Baylor University|date=April 2016}}</ref> According to the 2017 State Fair of Texas Annual Report,<ref>[https://bigtex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/9910_AnnualReport_2017_Reduced.pdf 2017 State Fair of Texas Annual Report] Retrieved Jul 15, 2018</ref> the Fair attracted a total of 2,250,433 attendees during the 2017 event with roughly 93,000 daily guests.

The first designated day for African-Americans to attend the fair was held in 1889 and was called \"Colored People's Day.\" Educator Norman Washington Harllee organized exhibits and planned events and speakers including Booker T. Washington in 1900. In 1910, \"Colored People's Day\" was discontinued and reappeared in 1936 as \"Negro Achievement Day\" set to coincide with the Texas Centennial Exposition. Contrary to the fact that African-Americans weren't allowed to participate in entertainment or eat at restaurants and concession stands on other days during the run, fair officials touted \"Negro Achievement Day\" as a way to recognize the accomplishments and progress of the Negro race in Texas and the United States.

The current El Monstruo has fallen on hard times and works as a henchmen for local crime lord Teddy \"Bear\" Haynes. With the help of the corrupt [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] Agent Fowler, Teddy kidnaps illegal immmigrants for the prostitution and organ harvesting ring run out of the basement of his taco shack. One day when El Monstruo escorts a customer to one of Teddy's sex slaves, the girl appears to believe he is there to save her, but he shamefully replies \"I am not that El Monstruo\". El Monstruo lives in contempt and hopes that his unborn son, carried by Teddy's adopted daughter Kaylee, will be able to bring honour back to the legacy he disgraced.\n\nWhen El Monstruo fails to get Teddy's money back from a man, Teddy fires him and implies that he's going to have them both killed. Kaylee quickly begins to pack but El Monstruo refuses to believe that his \"Jefe Teddy\" would betray them. When Kaylee threatens to hurt their baby if El Monstruo won't let her leave, he falls into a rage and wakes up to find Kaylee gone and their house a ruin. \n\nHe prays to his ancestors when he is attacked by Fowler. He falls into a rage and wakes outside a run down motel, holding Fowler's disembodied hand and gun. He uses the motels pay phone to ask Teddy's help in finding Kaylee. He goes outside to pray to his ancestors to guide him to his wife and son where he is confronted by the Motel's manager Crystal with a shotgun. \n\n'''Fiends''':\n\nCrystal and Dan are are recovering drug addicts who manage a run down motel. They are the biological parents of Kaylee and sold her to Teddy, believing she would have a better life. Instead, unbeknownst to them, Teddy prostituted her before El Monstruo \"saved her\". Dan needs a kidney transplant and Teddy arrives one day saying that Kaylee has offered one of hers. Crystal reluctantly agrees and pays Teddy the agreed amount. \n\nWhen Crystal begins to have concerns, she drives to Teddy's house, sees Kaylee in the garden and realizes she's pregnant. She calls Teddy to say it's off but he feigns ignorance and implies that it's too late for her to back out anyway. As she hangs up, she sees two men, including one with a swastika tattoo on his face, force Kaylee into a car. Crystal flees back to the motel and finds that Dan has committed suicide with a shotgun after discovering Crystal was buying Kaylee's kidney. Guilt stricken, Crystal takes the shotgun with her behind the motel counter. Just then the men who kidnapped Kaylee arrive and get a room, a shocked Crystal gives them the key before El Monstruo arrives and uses the payphone. However, El Monstruo mistakenly uses the intercom function, instead of leaving a message Crystal is able to hear that he is also looking for Kaylee. She loads the shotgun and confronts him in the parking lot. She asks if he is looking for Kayleigh, and when he answers \"yes\" she tells him the number of the room where the men took her. El Monstruo rushes to the door and she follows. They kick the door in and a shot is heard.\n\n'''Thugs''':\n\nEx-convict turned accountant Keith arrives at [[California State Prison]] to pick up his friend Randy who is being released after an 11 year stretch. Keith, an African-America, is disgusted to find that while in prison, Randy had a nazi swastika tattoo over his entire face. Randy denies being a nazi, and tells Keith that it was something he was forced to do in order to stay alive in prison. He explains that prison has given him an understanding of different cultures and he has learned fluent Spanish. Keith was Teddy's accountant and was embezzling money from him before Teddy discovered the theft. Teddy gives the pair an ultimatum; they must kidnap Kaylee to settle the debt, or Teddy will kill Randy's wife and children. \n\nThe pair arrive at Teddy's house and kidnap Kaylee. She explains that Teddy will kill them even if they do bring her to him. Randy wants to go through with it, fearing Teddy's wrath, but Keith is unsure. They decide to stop at a nearby motel, the same from earlier in the film. After they get a room, Kaylee begins giving birth. As the pair argue about what do to, the door bursts open and El Monstruo and Crystal enter. \n\n'''Criminals''':\n\nTeddy drives to Crystal's motel and enters room 101 to find Kaylee and the others helping her. Teddy orders El Monstruo to bring him Kaylee. Having learned about the legend of El Monstruo, Randy appeals to Monstruo in his native tongue. El Monstruo, honoured that someone has treated him as an equal, turns on Teddy. However, Teddy manages to kidnap Kaylee and keep the group at bay with an assault rifle. After he drives off, the group run out and attempt to follow him when they realize Keith has been shot in the arm. The group follow in Crystal's van. They discuss what to do with Keith, who is dying of blood loss. Keith implores that they rescue the girl as he dies. Arriving at Teddy's taco shack, El Monstruo leads the trio into the basement. They find Kaylee and the baby, now born, alive and unharmed in a meat fridge. When El Monstruo holds his son in his arms, he inexplicably runs out of the building exclaiming \"The legacy is all!\". Randy and Crystal try to escape with Kaylee but are shot at by Teddy. They barricade themselves in to buy time. \n\nOutside, El Monstruo walks the street holding his baby in his arms, he notices more corrupt ICE agents entering the restaurant. He has second thoughts and arrives to save the others just as the agents open the fridge. Randy attacks Teddy while Kaylee and Crystal flee, but they are stopped by Agent Fowler. He chokes Crystal and almost kills her before he is hit by Kaylee which allows Crystal to slit his throat. Meanwhile, Teddy knocks out Randy and shoots El Monstruo, who has killed the ICE agents, and he appears to die. Having been severely wounded, Teddy lies screaming threats and obscenities at Kayleigh and Crystal while clumsily loading his pistol. El Monstruo recovers enough to drag himself over to Teddy and punches his head to pulp using the power of his legendary rage. \n\nMoments later, Randy awakes to find a mortally wounded El Monstruo. He promises to look after the mask until his son can take up the mantle, but El Monstruo does not want the mask to burden his sons life as it did his. Randy implores El Monstruo not to allow the lineage to be broken, but Monstruo dies and asks Randy to free the prostitutes. Randy himself takes up the mask, it perfectly covers his swastika tattoo. He frees the prostitutes and vows to lead them back to \"our native land\" where he says they will flourish.  Crystal and Kaylee sit together in the van. Kaylee asks if Crystal is her mother, Crystal doesn't reply but gives Kaylee a tearful, telling glance. They hug each other and Kaylee remarks \"I'm going to need some help\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicki Micheaux]] as Crystal\n* Ricardo Adam Zarate as El Monstruo\n* Jon Oswald as Randy\n* Shaye Ogbonna as Keith\n* Santana Dempsey as Kaylee\n* Mark Burnham as Teddy \"Bear\" Haynes\n* King Orba as Dan\n\n==Production==\n{{Empty section|1=\n|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90%, based on 31 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.3/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lowlife_2018 |title=Lowlife (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lowlife |title=Lowlife Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that it \"Nicely calibrates a twisty course between straight crime melodrama and black comedy, one that has cult-following potential among adventurous genre fans.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/lowlife-review-1202742107/|title=Film Review: \u2018Lowlife\u2019|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=April 3, 2018|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref> John DeFore from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that it's \"A captivating feature debut despite some missteps, it flashes back to a time when every other filmmaking newcomer wanted to be [[Quentin Tarantino]]; surprisingly, it does not provoke the weary eye-rolling that greeted so many of those films.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/lowlife-1026244|title='Lowlife': Fantasia Review|last=DeFore|first=John|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.lowlifethemovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|7012864|Lowlife}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|lowlife_2018|Lowlife}}\n\n[[Category:2017 films]]\n[[Category:2010s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2010s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{missing information|the film's production, theatrical/home media releases, and awards|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Lowlife\n| image          = Lowlife poster.png\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = Ryan Prows\n| producer       = {{plainlist|\n* Narineh Hacopian\n* Derek Bish\u00e9\n* Tim Cairo\n}}\n| writer         = {{plainlist|\n* Tim Cairo\n* Jake Gibson\n* Shaye Ogbonna\n* Ryan Prows\n* Maxwell Michael Towson\n}}\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Nicki Micheaux]]\n* Ricardo Adam Zarate\n* Jon Oswald\n* Shaye Ogbonna\n* Santana Dempsey\n* Mark Burnham\n* King Orba\n}}\n| music          = [[Kreng (musician)|Kreng]]\n| cinematography = Benjamin Kitchens\n| editing        = {{plainlist|\n* Brett W.

The cast also features [[Helen Hunt]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], [[John Schuck]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[David Ogden Stiers]] and [[Charlize Theron]]. The [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] concerns an insurance investigator and an efficiency expert who are both hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels. The film bears much more in common with Allen's earlier [[screwball comedy film]]s than with other films made by him around the same time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n''The Curse of the Jade Scorpion'' received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1940, C.W. Briggs ([[Woody Allen]]) is an insurance investigator in New York City who is highly successful, owing to his many connections and ability to think like a criminal. His work does not impress Betty Ann Fitzgerald ([[Helen Hunt]]), an efficiency expert who butts heads with C.W. over his old-fashioned views. Her advice is usually followed, however, because she secretly is in a relationship with her boss, Chris Magruder ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), who constantly reassures her that they will be free to pursue their relationship in public once he finalizes his divorce with his wife.\n\nWhile attending a dinner with some employees, Voltan ([[David Ogden Stiers]]), a stage magician calls on Betty Ann and C.W. to be in his hypnotism act. Using the words \"Madagascar\" and \"Constantinople\" on them, respectively, as trigger words to put them in a trance, the two are given the suggestion that they are newlyweds who are madly in love before being reawakened. When C.W. returns home for the evening, he receives a call from Voltan, who uses C.W.'s trigger word to put him back in a trance and orders him to steal jewels for him. C.W. has no recollections of these crimes after he is woken up and is determined to prove himself by solving the crimes. He starts investigating Betty Ann on the grounds of her suspicious behavior (actually related to her affair with Chris) and sneaks into her house one evening. There, he witnesses Chris telling her that he has reconciled with his wife and will not have a divorce. When Magruder leaves, Betty Ann becomes drunk in a fit of depression and tries to jump out of a window. C.W. stops her and spends the night keeping her from other self-destructive activities.\n\nEventually, investigations start picking up evidence pointing to C.W., leading to his arrest. He manages to escape to Betty Ann's place, where she grudgingly hides him. Thinking that C.W. is no longer available, Voltan calls Betty Ann, using her trigger word of \"Madagascar\" to put her in a hypnotic state and steal for him. On her return, still in a trance, the subliminal suggestion of being in love leads her to seduce C.W. Eventually his co-workers and friends George Bond ([[Wallace Shawn]]) and Alvin \"Al\" ([[Brian Markinson]]) recall the initial hypnotism and realize that it is the cause of the robberies. George, an amateur magician, frees C.W. of the trigger word and restores his memories. C.W. realizes what has happened and goes back to Betty Ann's apartment to find her missing. He then realizes that she must have been hypnotized again and manages to locate the site where the still-hypnotized Betty Ann is delivering the jewels to Voltan. Voltan discovers C.W. and holds him at gunpoint. However, C.W. deduces that a small-time criminal like Voltan would not have the nerve to do something as drastic as murder. Voltan tries escaping, but the police catch him shortly after. The still-hypnotized Betty Ann expresses her love for C.W. who takes advantage of her state to passionately kiss her before erasing her memories of the event.\n\nBack at work, the employees talk about Betty Ann and Chris going on a romantic getaway. C.W. goes to Chris to inform him of his resignation. An apologetic Chris understands and lets him know that if C.W. leaves, the company will give him his blessing and if he stays, Chris will give him a raise. He also promises C.W. that if he stays, he will make sure that Betty Ann will no longer interfere with his work, letting him know that he intends on forcing her to retire after they get married, as he does not want his wife to be working with him. This visibly disturbs C.W., who then heads to Betty Ann's office to let her know of his resignation and say goodbye. The two have a parting drink during which Betty Ann playfully insults C.W. a few more times and he expresses his amazement that an intelligent woman like Betty Ann would be with Chris, stating that she refuses to be vulnerable even at the price of finding true love and happiness. Outside, Al says that he will quit if C.W. does, and the rest of the staff hail him as a hero. C.W. dismisses his success as luck. When Al notes that hypnotism can make people do things that they do not want to do, George reveals that a hypnotized would not do anything that they would not when in a normal state, leading everyone to realize that both C.W. and Betty Ann have secret criminal instincts. Al then privately gets C.W. to admit that he loves Betty Ann. At Al's urging, C.W. decides to go after Betty Ann, who is about to leave for Paris with Chris. C.W. proceeds to propose to Betty Ann, confess his love for her, and convince her that she loves him, too. She repeatedly rejects and insults C.W. while Chris tries to get C.W. to leave. As Betty Ann and Chris are about to leave, a desperate C.W. uses her trigger word to hypnotize Betty Ann. Betty Ann, who is now in an amorous state, dreamily tells Chris that she is staying with C.W. and announces that the two are getting married, confessing to C.W. that she fell in love with him the moment that they met. A frantic Chris runs to stop his divorce while Al presents C.W. with the jade scorpion as a gift. C.W. and Betty Ann decide to go to her apartment to have sex. As they are leaving, Al notes that it was lucky that George forgot to deprogram Betty Ann, but George reveals that he had done that the night before. Meanwhile, Betty Ann continues to gush out her love for C.W., and C.W. promises her that he will be able to make her love him for real. Betty Ann notes that anything is possible, pointing out that she was able to make C.W. fall in love with her without using his trigger word. At that moment, he realizes that Betty Ann is no longer hypnotized and finds her grinning knowingly. Understanding that she is going with him willingly, the two head off with Betty Ann putting her arm around him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] \u2013 C.W.

Approximately 70% of Egyptian migrants live in Arab countries (923,600 in [[Saudi Arabia]], 332,600 in [[Libya]], 226,850 in [[Jordan]], 190,550 in [[Kuwait]] with the rest elsewhere in the region) and the remaining 30% are living mostly in Europe and North America (318,000 in the [[United States]], 110,000 in [[Canada]] and 90,000 in [[Italy]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |title=Migration And Development In Egypt |accessdate=2017-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501234716/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |archive-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Their characteristic rootedness as Egyptians, commonly explained as the result of centuries as a farming people clinging to the banks of the [[Nile]], is reflected in sights, sounds and atmosphere that are meaningful to all Egyptians. Dominating the intangible pull of Egypt is the ever present Nile, which is more than a constant backdrop. Its varying colors and changing water levels signal the coming and going of the Nile flood that sets the rhythm of farming in a rainless country and holds the attention of all Egyptians. No Egyptian is ever far from his river and, except for the [[Alexandria|Alexandrines]] whose personality is split by looking outward toward the Mediterranean, the Egyptians are a hinterland people with little appetite for travel, even inside their own country. They glorify their national dishes, including the [[Ful Medames|variety of concoctions surrounding the simple bean]]. Most of all, they have a sense of all-encompassing familiarity at home and a sense of alienation when abroad ...

During this period, Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of [[Egyptian mythology|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs.\n\nEgypt fell under [[Hyksos]] rule in the Middle [[Bronze Age]]. The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the [[Late Bronze Age]], thereby initiating the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. During this period, the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. It remained a super-regional power throughout the [[Amarna Period]] as well as during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties (the Ramesside Period), lasting into the Early [[Iron Age]].\n\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse]] that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. The [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] of [[Nubian people|Nubian]] rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]].\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] was greeted as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. The [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] is taken to end with his death in 323 BC. The [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty]] ruled Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC and introduced [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] culture to Egyptians. 4,000 [[Celts|Celtic]] mercenaries under Ptolemy II had even attempted an ambitious but doomed coup d'\u00e9tat around the year 270 BC.\n\nThroughout the Pharaonic epoch (viz., from 2920 BC to 525 BC in [[conventional Egyptian chronology]]), [[divine kingship]] was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.<ref>Grimal, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe role of the king was considerably weakened after the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]]. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|Ma'at]], the principle of truth, justice, and order, and to enhance the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]]. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father [[Osiris]]. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.\n\nThe attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian society]]. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the [[Great Pyramids]]. The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for tomb ''{{transl|egy|pr n\u1e25\u1e25}}'' means '[[House of Eternity' (Ancient Egypt)|House of Eternity]]'. The Egyptians also celebrated life, as is shown by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.<ref>Watterson, p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File: Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 005.jpg|thumb|300px|A boat scene, the tomb of Nebamun, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], Thebes.]]\nAnother important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners\u2014those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of ''rm\u1e6f'' or \"the people\" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed [[Nubia]] through [[Jebel Barkal]] and parts of the [[Levant]].\n\nThe Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of ''Ta-Meri'' (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat\u2014a view most clearly expressed by the [[Ipuwer papyrus|admonitions of Ipuwer]] in reaction to the chaotic events of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms, e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the Hyksos, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Berber people|Libyans]], Persians and Greeks\u2014their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. The calendar revolved around the annual [[Nile]] Inundation (''akh.t''), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian ''[[fellah]]in'' calculate the agricultural seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner.\n\nThe importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation was the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god [[Hapy]] and dedicated a ''Hymn to the Nile'' to celebrate it. ''km.t'', the Black Land, was as [[Herodotus]] observed, \"the gift of the river.\"\n\n===Graeco-Roman period===\n{{Main|Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Fayum-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman-era portrait of an Egyptian mummy from the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Fayum collection]], ''c.'' AD 125 \u2212 AD 150]]\n\nWhen Alexander died, a story began to circulate that [[Nectanebo II]] was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.<ref>Watterson, p. 192</ref> The new Ptolemaic rulers, however, exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created between Egyptians and Greeks.<ref>Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 11</ref> The local priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the Dynastic age. Egyptians continued to practice their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.<ref>Watterson, p. 215</ref> The language of administration became [[Greek language|Greek]], but the mass of the Egyptian population was [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.<ref>Jankowski, p. 28</ref>\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by great native pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]]. Prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks, and frequent revolts by the Egyptians took place throughout the Ptolemaic period.<ref>Kamil, p. 12</ref> A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about to fill a spiritual void as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and weary due to successive waves of foreign invasions.<ref>Watterson, p. 214</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. The art of [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraiture]] flourished, but Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, Greeks and [[Jews]] occupied the middle stratum, while Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, were at the bottom. Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.<ref>Watterson, p. 237</ref>\n\nThe Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying \"genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech.\"<ref>qtd. in Alan K. Bowman ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC \u2212 AD 642''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. p. 126.</ref> This attitude lasted until AD 212 when Roman citizenship was finally granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.<ref>Jankowski, p. 29</ref> The Romans, like the Ptolemies, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered and fled to the desert.<ref>Kamil, p. 16</ref>\n\nThe cult of [[Isis]], like those of [[Osiris]] and [[Serapis]], had been popular in Egypt and throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child [[Horus]] with that of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and her son [[Jesus]] escaping the emperor [[Herod the Great|Herod]].<ref>Kamil, p. 21</ref>\n\nConsequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt\" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the early 40s of the 1st century, under the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The earliest converts were Jews residing in [[Alexandria]], a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean ''[[oikoumene]]''.\n\n[[File:Coptic manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|A Coptic-Arabic manuscript, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period, AD 1249\u201350. Images depict [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane, the kiss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], the arrest of Christ, his appearance before [[Caiaphas]], Peter's denial at cockcrow, Christ before [[Pilate]], and the baptism of Jesus in the [[Jordan River]].]]\nSt. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]]. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\">Jankowski, p. 32</ref>\n\nThis event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\"/>\n\nThe Catachetical School of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century by [[Pantaenus]], becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The [[Psalms]] and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] along with its [[Coptic alphabet|alphabet]]. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of [[Origen]]. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential [[Church Fathers]]. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the ''[[Hexapla]]'', an [[exegesis]] of various translations of the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Bible]].\n\nAt the threshold of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptian temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.<ref>Kamil, p. 35</ref>\n\nOne of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek [[Melkite]]s had both theological and national implications. As [[Coptologist]] Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians \"paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. [[Coptic art]] developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power.\"<ref>Kamil, p. 39</ref>\n\n===Islamic period from Late antiquity to Middle Ages===\n<!-- [[File:Abdelbaset.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Abdul Basit 'Abd us-Samad|Qari Abdul Baset]], renowned Egyptian [[Quran]] reciter.]] -->\n[[File:Dhulnun tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Egyptian saint [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (AD 796\u2013859) in Cairo's [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|City of the Dead]].]]\n[[File:Invitation-d'un-marriage-arab.jpg|thumb|right|En Route to an [[Arab Wedding]] or Katb el-Kit\u0101b in Cairo, Egypt]]\nBefore the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] was able to reclaim the country after a brief [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|Persian invasion]] in AD 616, and subsequently appointed [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.<ref>Watterson, p. 232</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the new religion of [[Islam]] was making headway in [[Arabia]], culminating in the [[Muslim conquests]] that took place following [[Muhammad]]'s Passing on. In AD 639, the Arab general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Heliopolis]] that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that most Egyptians did not put up heavy resistance against the Arabs.<ref>Kamil, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe new Muslim rulers moved the capital to [[Fustat]] and, through the 7th century, retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with [[Greek language|Greek]] as its language. Native Egyptians filled administrative ranks and continued to worship freely so long as they paid the [[jizya]] poll tax, in addition to a [[kharaj|land tax]] that all Egyptians irrespective of religion also had to pay. The authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was for the first time nationally recognized.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\">Watterson, p. 268</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]], repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Muslim Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\"/> The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids\u2014a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen \"within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq.\"<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 165</ref>\n\nThe form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was [[Sunni]], though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early [[monasticism]] so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, [[Sufism]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 140</ref> Various Sufi [[tariqa|orders]] were founded in the 8th century and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in [[Akhmim]] in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. p. 26</ref>\n\nDhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of [[Gnosis]] into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 164</ref> He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.<ref>El-Daly, p. 112</ref>\n\n[[File:Al Azhar1.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Azhar Mosque]] founded in AD 970 by the Fatimids]]\n[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.04.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque of Abu Haggag]] built in the 11th century over the ruins of a pharaonic temple.

In time the power of the Arabs waned throughout the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] so that in the 10th century, the Turkish [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshids]] were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire.\n\nEgyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] of Arabic, which was to eventually slowly supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language.\n\n[[Al-Azhar]] was founded in AD 970 in the new capital [[Cairo]], not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper\n\nThe [[Mamluks of Egypt]] (AD 1258\u20131517)  as a whole were,  some of the most enlightened rulers of Egypt, not only in the arts and in providing for the welfare of their subjects, but also in many other ways, such as efficient organisation of law and order and postal services, and the building of canals, roads, bridges and aqueducts.<ref>[http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/world_history/A_Short_History_of_Egypt.pdf A Short History of Egypt \u2013 to about 1970 from University of Standford]\n</ref> Though turbulent, often treacherous and brutal in their feuds, and politically and economically inept, the later Mameluks maintained the splendour and artistic traditions of their predecessors.

It was a period in which learning flourished.\n\nTheir rule is generally {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered.

Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]]. Historian James Jankwoski writes:{{quote|Ultimately, Mamluk rule rested on force. The chronicles of the period are replete with examples of Mamluk violence against the indigenous population of Egypt...From horseback, they simply terrorized those lesser breeds who crossed their paths. The sudden and arbitrary use of force by the government and its dominant military elite; frequent resort to cruelty to make a point; ingenious methods of torture employed both for exemplary purpose and to extract wealth from others: all these measures were routine in the Mamluk era. Egypt under the Mamluks was not a very secure place to live.<ref>''A Short History of Egypt'', p. 47</ref>}}\n\n===Ottoman period===\nEgyptians under the [[Ottoman Turks]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term ''atrak'' (Turks) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk [[Bey]]s took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim '''ulama'' or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt, native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt, particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha.\n\n{{quote|From the Egyptian side, literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam, but retained an awareness of Egypt's distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world, as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor...

The [[French people|French]] defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], and soon they were able to seize control of the country.\n\nThe French occupation was short-lived, ending when [[British Empire|British]] troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence.\n\nWhen Napoleon invited the Egyptian ''ulama'' to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]'', was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition.\n\nThe withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], an Ottoman officer of [[Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim ''ulama'' as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar-cane]]), increased industrialization, and a new educational system\u2014the results of which are felt to this day.<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\">Jankowskil, p. 74</ref>\n\nIn order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the [[Levant]], [[Sudan]] and against the [[Wahhabism|Wahabis]] in [[Arabia]].<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\"/> Many Egyptians student missions were sent to Europe in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.\n\n====Nationalism====\n[[File:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]], 1801\u20131873, laid the groundwork for the modern Egyptian Renaissance.]]\nThe period between 1860\u20131940 was characterized by an Egyptian ''nahda'', renaissance or rebirth. It is best known for the renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\">Vatikiotis, p. 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe first Egyptian renaissance intellectual was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]]. In 1831, Tahtawi undertook a career in journalism, education and translation. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral [[philosophy]]. In them he introduces his students to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or \"good Egyptian\"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\"/>\n\nTahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. He also co-founded with his contemporary [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]], the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like [[Suyuti]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Maqrizi]], who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities.<ref>El-Daly, p. 29</ref> Tahtawi encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]] who had enlisted the [[Greeks]]' help in organizing the Egyptian army.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Silk weavers.JPG|thumb|Egyptian silk weavers during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]], 1880.]]\nAmong Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was [[Isma'il Pasha]] who became [[khedive]] in 1863. Ismail's reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Khedivial Opera House|Royal Opera House]], the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt, including villages, which meant that native Egyptians came to exert increasing political and economic influence over their country.<ref>Jankowski, p. 83</ref> Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of [[constitutionalism]] made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of Turks, Greeks, [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIsmail's massive modernization campaign, however, left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in local affairs. This led to the formation of secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 135</ref>\n\nWhen the British deposed Ismail and installed his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfik]], the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by Minister of War [[Ahmed Urabi]], self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|military failure]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Mohammed Ali family]] ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place.\n\n====Liberal age====\n{{Main|Liberalism in Egypt}}\n[[File:Mustafa Kamil.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] (1874\u22121908), an anti-colonial nationalist famous for coining the phrase, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one\".]]\nEgyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 189</ref>\n\nSheikh [[Muhammad Abduh]], the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar [[Mufti]], was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the [[modernism|modernist]] interpretations of [[Islam]] that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.\"\n\nEgyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 [[Dinshaway Incident]], when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-[[colonialism|colonial]] resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal ''Umma'' (the Nation, 1907) headed by [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and the more radical, pro-Islamic ''Watani'' Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of [[Ad Daqahliyah|Daqahliya]] in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: \"El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.\"<ref>qtd. in Vatikiotis, p. 227</ref>\n\nBoth the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]]) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] and the People's Party. Prominent among these was [[Saad Zaghlul]] who led the new movement through the [[Wafd Party]]. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to [[Malta]], the Egyptian people staged their [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.<ref>Jankowski, p. 112</ref>\n\nThe Wafd Party drafted a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|new Constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the radical [[Misr El-Fatah (Young Egypt) Party|Young Egypt Party]]. In 1920, [[Banque Misr]] (Bank of Egypt) was founded by [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] as \"an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only\",<ref>qtd. in Jankowski p. 123</ref> which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.\n\n[[File:Farouk family official.jpg|thumb|[[King Farouk I]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida]] and their first-born daughter [[Princess Farial of Egypt|Princess Ferial]] c. 1940.]]\nUnder the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], were [[Qasim Amin]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Abbas Al-Akkad|Abbas el-'Akkad]], [[Tawfiq al-Hakeem|Tawfiq el-Hakeem]], and [[Salama Moussa]]. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]], an [[evolution]]ary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.<ref>Jankowski, p. 130</ref> This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a [[Golden Age]] of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage.\n\nWhen Egyptian novelist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]] died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had died. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as ''Mon \u00c9gypte'', Mahfouz had this to say:\n\n{{quote|Egypt is not just a piece of land. Egypt is the inventor of civilisation ... The strange thing is that this country of great history and unsurpassed civilisation is nothing but a thin strip along the banks of the Nile ... This thin strip of land created moral values, launched the concept of monotheism, developed arts, invented science and gave the world a stunning administration. These factors enabled the Egyptians to survive while other cultures and nations withered and died ... Throughout history Egyptians have felt that their mission is to tend to life. They were proud to turn the land green, to make it blossom with life. The other thing is that Egyptians invented morality long before the major religions appeared on earth. Morality is not just a system for control but a protection against chaos and death ... Egypt gave Islam a new voice. It didn't change the basic tenets of Islam, but its cultural weight gave Islam a new voice, one it didn't have back in Arabia. Egypt embraced an Islam that was moderate, tolerant and non-extremist. Egyptians are very pious, but they know how to mix piety with joy, just as their ancestors did centuries ago. Egyptians celebrate religious occasions with flair. For them, religious festivals and the month of Ramadan are occasions to celebrate life.<ref>Salmawy, Mohamed.

The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic.

Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat revived an ''Egypt Above All'' orientation, switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike.\n\nEgyptians fought one last time in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|October War]] in an attempt to liberate Egyptian territories captured by Israel six years earlier. The October War presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai.

Sadat was [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassinated]] in [[Cairo]] by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] in 1981, and was succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].\n\nHosni Mubarak was the president from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011, when he resigned under pressure of [[2011 Egyptian protests|popular protest]].

It is represented in a body of [[vernacular literature]] comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Classical Arabic]] is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.\n\nWhile the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language, it has also been influenced by many other languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and the old [[Egyptian language]]. This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions, including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion. As each nation came and went, the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language among the [[Arab world]]. This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread. As a result, most Arabic countries have grown up listening to the dialect and therefore have no trouble understanding it, even though they actually speak their own.\n\nOriginally the Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphics. At first the meaning of the hieroglyphics was unknown; until one day in the year 1799 Napole\u00f3n Bonaparte's soldiers dug up the Rosetta stone. The Rosetta Stone was found broken and incomplete. It features 14 lines of hieroglyphic script, 32 lines in Demotic and 53 lines of Ancient Greek.\n\n==Identity==\n{{Life in Egypt}}\n{{further|Pan-Arabism|Pharaonism|Coptic identity|Islamism}}\n[[File:The-irrepressible-donkey-boys-at-Cairo.jpg|thumb|300px|Egyptian donkey herders at the start of the British occupation of Egypt, circa 1860s.]]\n\nThe degree to which Egyptians identify with each layer of Egypt's history in articulating a sense of collective identity can vary and was hugely influenced by Islamization and Arabization, same as almost all [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabic-speaking countries]].  \n\n===Ancient Egypt===\nThe categorization of people as ''Egyptians'', ''Asiatics'', ''Libyans'' and ''Nubians'' occurred in Egyptian documents of state ideology and were contingent on [[Sociocultural system|Social]] and [[Culture|Cultural]] factors among the ancient populations themselves.<ref name=JournalofEgyptianHistory>{{Cite Web| url=https://brill.com/view/journals/jeh/11/1-2/article-p243_10.xml?lang=en |title=Ethnic Identities in Ancient Egypt and the Identity of Egyptology: Towards a \"Trans-Egyptology\" |author=Thomas Schneider }}</ref>\n\n===Egypt and Africa===\nEven though Egypt is mostly located in North Africa, Egypt and the Egyptian people do not generally have an [[Culture of Africa|African identity]].<ref name=Egypt,Africa>{{Cite Web |quote=Many Egyptians do not consider themselves Africans.

The Egyptians were discriminated against in the military where they weren't allowed to hold any important positions. That contributed to forming an early sense of a collective imagined community among Arab soldiers as opposed to Turks, Kurds, and Albanians. Throughout the Ottoman Empire, all Arabic speakers, especially Muslims, were viewed as Arabs. As a consequence, being \"Arab\" was equivalent to being Egyptian in modern day. In an attempt to prove to his soldiers that he is one of them, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of Mohammed Ali Pasha, who was an [[Albanians|Albanian]], told one of his soldiers after criticizing Turks: \"I am not a Turk, I came to Egypt when I was a child, and since that time, its sun has changed my blood, and I became fully Arab\".<ref>All the Pasha's Men, Arabic Version, P 337</ref>\n\n===British Rule===\nBeginning 1860, the state started making efforts to shape a collective Egyptian Identity, and the word \"Misreyeen\" started slowly replacing the word \"Evlad Arab\".

The Orabi movement in the 1870s and 1880s was the first major Egyptian nationalist movement that demanded an end to the alleged despotism of the Muhammad Ali family and demanded curbing the growth of European influence in Egypt, it campaigned under the nationalist slogan of \"''Egypt for Egyptians''\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=138}}\n\nAs a result of the increasing European influence, western ideas started becoming prevalent among the upper classes in Egypt {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Especially after the British occupation of Egypt which brought a westernized style of education with it. Among the western ideas, the French Enlightenment notion of reviving Pre-Christian civilizations and cultures found a special place among Egyptian Nationalists {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}, who sought to revive the Pharaonic culture as the main Pre-Islamic civilization of Egypt. Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as \"Pharaonism\"). After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain, other forms of nationalism developed, including secular [[Arab nationalism]] as well as [[Islamism]].\n\n\"Pharaonism\" rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation, as Egypt developed separately from the [[Arab world]]. A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean civilization]]. This ideology largely developed out of the country's lengthy pre-Islamic pre-Arab history, the relative isolation of the [[Nile Valley]] and the mostly homogeneous indigenous non-Arab genetic ancestry/ethnicity of the inhabitants,<ref name=\"Hinnesbusch\">Hinnesbusch, p. 93.</ref> regardless of current religious identity.

According to Dawisha, the terms \"Arab\", \"Arabism\" and \"Arab unity\", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.<ref>Dawisha, pp. 264\u201365, 267</ref> (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Republic]] sections.) However, despite Sadat's systematic attempts to root out Arab sentiment, Arab nationalism in Egypt remained a potent force.<ref name=\"Barakat4\"/>\n\nDuring this era, in 1978, Egyptian-American sociologist [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] studied the national discourse between 17 Egyptian intellectuals relating to Egypt's identity and peace with Israel. He noted that in 18 articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict]] opposed, while in eight articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality supported and only in three articles written by author [[Louis Awad]] was Arab identity rejected and neutrality supported.<ref name=\"Barakat5\"/> Egyptian scholar [[Gamal Hamdan]] stressed that Egyptian identity was unique, but that Egypt was the center and \"cultural hub\" of the Arab world, arguing that \"Egypt in the Arab world is like Cairo in Egypt.\" Hamdan further contended \"We do not see the Egyptian personality, no matter how distinct it may be, as anything other than a part of the personality of the greater Arab homeland.\"<ref name=\"Barakat4\">Barakat, p. 4.</ref>\n\nMany Egyptians today feel that Egyptian and Arab identities are inextricably linked, and emphasize the central role that Egypt plays in the Arab world. Others continue to believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage, culture and independent polity, pointing to the perceived failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies. Egyptian anthropologist Laila el-Hamamsy illustrates the modern-day relationship between the two trends, stating: \"in light of their history, Egyptians ... should be conscious of their national identity and consider themselves, above all, Egyptians. How is the Egyptian, with this strong sense of Egyptian identity, able to look himself as an Arab too?\"<ref>Barakat, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Her explanation is that Egyptianization translated as Arabization with the result being \"an increased tempo of Arabization, for facility in the Arabic language opened the windows into the rich legacy of Arabic culture. ...

Ancient Egypt was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the [[Near East]] and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christianity]] and [[Muslim culture|Islamic]] culture.

Chech arab.jpg|thumb|An Egyptian elder, 1860s]] \nToday, Egyptians carry names that have Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, Greek and Western meanings (especially Coptic ones) among others. The concept of a [[surname]] is lacking in Egypt. Rather, Egyptians tend to carry their father's name as their first middle name, and stop at the 2nd or 3rd first name, which thus becomes one's surname. In this manner, surnames continuously change with generations, as first names of 4th or 5th generations get dropped.\n[[File:Charmeur des serpents 1860s.jpg|thumb|A serpent charmer in Egypt, 1860s]]\n\nSome Egyptians tend to have Surnames based on their cities, like ''Monoufi'' (from [[Monufia]]), ''Banhawy'' (from [[Benha]]), ''Aswany'' (from [[Aswan]]), ''Tahtawy'' (from [[Tahta]]), ''Fayoumi'' (from [[Fayoum]]), ''Sakandary / Eskandrani'' (from [[Alexandria]]) and so on. \n\nAs a result of the Long Islamic history of Egypt, and as a result of several mass migration waves into Egypt such as the [[Banu Hilal]] Exodus. Some Egyptian muslims carry historical Arabic last names. For example the surname \"Al Sharif\" (The Noble) from the Ashraf tribes \"Al Juhaini\", from Juhainah, \"Al Qarmouti\" from Al Qaramita, \"Al Hawary\" from Hawara.\n\nOther people have their family names based on their traditional crafts, like ''El Nagar'' ([[Carpenter]]), ''El Fawal'' (the one who sells [[Ful medames|Foul]]), ''El Hadad'' ([[Blacksmith]]), ''El Khayat'' ([[Tailor]]) and so on. \n\nThe Majority of people, however, have surnames that used to be their great grand parents first names, this habit is especially dominant among the fellahin, where Surnames isn't really strong tradition. For example, if a person named Khaled Mohamed Ali has a son named Ashraf, his son's full name may become Ashraf Khaled Mohamed. Thus, a son may have a different last name than his father.\n\nHowever,It is not entirely unusual for families to have Ancient Egyptian based names (especially Coptic ones) and have their first names or surnames beginning with the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] masculine possessive [[pronoun]] ''pa'' (generally ''ba'' in Arabic, which lost the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the course of developing from [[Proto-Semitic]]). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) \"of Fayyoum\", Fayyoum meaning \"of the big water (yom)\", Basyouni (of [[Aswan]]), Bashandi, Bakhoum (\"the eagle\"), Bekhit, Bahur (\"of [[Horus]]\") and Banoub (\"of [[Anubis]]\").\n\nThe name Shenouda, which is very common among [[Copt]], means \"child of God\". Hence, names and many [[toponym]]s may end with ''-nouda'', ''-noudi'' or ''-nuti'', which means ''Of God'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as Minyawi from [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] and [[Suyuti]] from [[Asyut]]; or from one of the local [[Sufi]] orders such as el-Shazli and el-Sawy. More examples of prominent surnames are [[Qozman]] and [[Habib]].\n\nWith the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and [[Arabization|Arabized]], meaning they were altered to sound [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix ''-ios'' to Egyptian names; for example, Pakhom to Pakhomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article ''el'' to names such as Baymoui to el-Bayoumi.\n\nNames starting with the [[Ancient Egyptian]] affix ''pu'' (\"of the place of\") were sometimes Arabized to ''abu'' (\"father of\"); for example, Busiri (\"of the place of [[Osiris]]\") occasionally became [[Abusir]] and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shamy (\"the Levantine\") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Dewidar indicating an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri (\"the Egyptian\") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are more likely to retain indigenous names given their relative isolation throughout the Egyptian people's history.\n\nWith [[French people|French]] influence, names like [[Mounier]], [[Pierre]], and many others became common, particularly in the Christian community.\n\n==Genetic history==\n{{main article|DNA history of Egypt}}\n{{see also|Population history of Egypt}}\nBeginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]], some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]] pattern north to south.<ref>Batrawi A (1945).

[the] [[Badari|Badarian people]], who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a [Nile Valley] continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-[Nile Valley] population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct Afro-Asiatic African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.\"<ref>Frank Yurco, \"An Egyptological Review\" in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, eds. ''Black Athena Revisited''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996. p. 62-100</ref></blockquote>\n\nA 2006 [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] study on the dental [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[ancient Egyptians]] by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n and southern European populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which clustered very closely with the [[Badarian]] series of the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:\n<blockquote>[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced [[dentition]]s that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a\u2013c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing [[phenetic]] distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD \u00bc 0.050), 11\u201312th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th\u201330th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... [[Gebel Ramlah]] [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from [[Badari]] based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.<ref>Irish pp. 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nA study published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from Abusir. The study was able to measure the mitochondrial DNA of 90 individuals, and it showed that [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptians]] had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern ([[Arabs]], [[Levant|Levantine]] and [[Anatolia|Anatolian]]) and [[North Africa|North African]] populations and had significantly more affinity with south-eastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Genome-wide data could only be successfully extracted from three of these individuals. Of these three, the Y-chromosome haplogroups of two individuals could be assigned to the Middle-Eastern haplogroup J, and one to haplogroup E1b1b1 common in North Africa. The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African ancestry in these three individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is slightly lower than the level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in Egyptians from Abusir, who range from 14 to 21%. The study's authors cautioned that the Mummies may be unrepresentative of the whole Ancient Egyptian population, since they were recovered from the northern part of Egypt and that the Southern part might have more Sub-Saharan component being closer to [[Nubia]].<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999|bibcode=2017NatCo...815694S}}</ref> and that they only dated from the late New Kingdom to the Roman Period.

During this period, Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of [[Egyptian mythology|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs.\n\nEgypt fell under [[Hyksos]] rule in the Middle [[Bronze Age]]. The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the [[Late Bronze Age]], thereby initiating the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. During this period, the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. It remained a super-regional power throughout the [[Amarna Period]] as well as during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties (the Ramesside Period), lasting into the Early [[Iron Age]].\n\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse]] that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. The [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] of [[Nubian people|Nubian]] rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]].\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] was greeted as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. The [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] is taken to end with his death in 323 BC. The [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty]] ruled Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC and introduced [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] culture to Egyptians. 4,000 [[Celts|Celtic]] mercenaries under Ptolemy II had even attempted an ambitious but doomed coup d'\u00e9tat around the year 270 BC.\n\nThroughout the Pharaonic epoch (viz., from 2920 BC to 525 BC in [[conventional Egyptian chronology]]), [[divine kingship]] was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.<ref>Grimal, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe role of the king was considerably weakened after the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]]. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|Ma'at]], the principle of truth, justice, and order, and to enhance the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]]. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father [[Osiris]]. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.\n\nThe attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian society]]. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the [[Great Pyramids]]. The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for tomb ''{{transl|egy|pr n\u1e25\u1e25}}'' means '[[House of Eternity' (Ancient Egypt)|House of Eternity]]'. The Egyptians also celebrated life, as is shown by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.<ref>Watterson, p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File: Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 005.jpg|thumb|300px|A boat scene, the tomb of Nebamun, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], Thebes.]]\nAnother important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners\u2014those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of ''rm\u1e6f'' or \"the people\" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed [[Nubia]] through [[Jebel Barkal]] and parts of the [[Levant]].\n\nThe Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of ''Ta-Meri'' (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat\u2014a view most clearly expressed by the [[Ipuwer papyrus|admonitions of Ipuwer]] in reaction to the chaotic events of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms, e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the Hyksos, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Berber people|Libyans]], Persians and Greeks\u2014their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. The calendar revolved around the annual [[Nile]] Inundation (''akh.t''), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian ''[[fellah]]in'' calculate the agricultural seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner.\n\nThe importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation was the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god [[Hapy]] and dedicated a ''Hymn to the Nile'' to celebrate it. ''km.t'', the Black Land, was as [[Herodotus]] observed, \"the gift of the river.\"\n\n===Graeco-Roman period===\n{{Main|Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Fayum-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman-era portrait of an Egyptian mummy from the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Fayum collection]], ''c.'' AD 125 \u2212 AD 150]]\n\nWhen Alexander died, a story began to circulate that [[Nectanebo II]] was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.<ref>Watterson, p. 192</ref> The new Ptolemaic rulers, however, exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created between Egyptians and Greeks.<ref>Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 11</ref> The local priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the Dynastic age. Egyptians continued to practice their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.<ref>Watterson, p. 215</ref> The language of administration became [[Greek language|Greek]], but the mass of the Egyptian population was [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.<ref>Jankowski, p. 28</ref>\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by great native pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]]. Prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks, and frequent revolts by the Egyptians took place throughout the Ptolemaic period.<ref>Kamil, p. 12</ref> A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about to fill a spiritual void as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and weary due to successive waves of foreign invasions.<ref>Watterson, p. 214</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. The art of [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraiture]] flourished, but Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, Greeks and [[Jews]] occupied the middle stratum, while Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, were at the bottom. Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.<ref>Watterson, p. 237</ref>\n\nThe Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying \"genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech.\"<ref>qtd. in Alan K. Bowman ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC \u2212 AD 642''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. p. 126.</ref> This attitude lasted until AD 212 when Roman citizenship was finally granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.<ref>Jankowski, p. 29</ref> The Romans, like the Ptolemies, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered and fled to the desert.<ref>Kamil, p. 16</ref>\n\nThe cult of [[Isis]], like those of [[Osiris]] and [[Serapis]], had been popular in Egypt and throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child [[Horus]] with that of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and her son [[Jesus]] escaping the emperor [[Herod the Great|Herod]].<ref>Kamil, p. 21</ref>\n\nConsequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt\" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the early 40s of the 1st century, under the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The earliest converts were Jews residing in [[Alexandria]], a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean ''[[oikoumene]]''.\n\n[[File:Coptic manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|A Coptic-Arabic manuscript, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period, AD 1249\u201350. Images depict [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane, the kiss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], the arrest of Christ, his appearance before [[Caiaphas]], Peter's denial at cockcrow, Christ before [[Pilate]], and the baptism of Jesus in the [[Jordan River]].]]\nSt. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]]. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\">Jankowski, p. 32</ref>\n\nThis event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\"/>\n\nThe Catachetical School of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century by [[Pantaenus]], becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The [[Psalms]] and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] along with its [[Coptic alphabet|alphabet]]. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of [[Origen]]. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential [[Church Fathers]]. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the ''[[Hexapla]]'', an [[exegesis]] of various translations of the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Bible]].\n\nAt the threshold of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptian temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.<ref>Kamil, p. 35</ref>\n\nOne of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek [[Melkite]]s had both theological and national implications. As [[Coptologist]] Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians \"paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. [[Coptic art]] developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power.\"<ref>Kamil, p. 39</ref>\n\n===Islamic period from Late antiquity to Middle Ages===\n<!-- [[File:Abdelbaset.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Abdul Basit 'Abd us-Samad|Qari Abdul Baset]], renowned Egyptian [[Quran]] reciter.]] -->\n[[File:Dhulnun tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Egyptian saint [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (AD 796\u2013859) in Cairo's [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|City of the Dead]].]]\n[[File:Invitation-d'un-marriage-arab.jpg|thumb|right|En Route to an [[Arab Wedding]] or Katb el-Kit\u0101b in Cairo, Egypt]]\nBefore the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] was able to reclaim the country after a brief [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|Persian invasion]] in AD 616, and subsequently appointed [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.<ref>Watterson, p. 232</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the new religion of [[Islam]] was making headway in [[Arabia]], culminating in the [[Muslim conquests]] that took place following [[Muhammad]]'s Passing on. In AD 639, the Arab general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Heliopolis]] that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that most Egyptians did not put up heavy resistance against the Arabs.<ref>Kamil, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe new Muslim rulers moved the capital to [[Fustat]] and, through the 7th century, retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with [[Greek language|Greek]] as its language. Native Egyptians filled administrative ranks and continued to worship freely so long as they paid the [[jizya]] poll tax, in addition to a [[kharaj|land tax]] that all Egyptians irrespective of religion also had to pay. The authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was for the first time nationally recognized.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\">Watterson, p. 268</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]], repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Muslim Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\"/> The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids\u2014a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen \"within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq.\"<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 165</ref>\n\nThe form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was [[Sunni]], though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early [[monasticism]] so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, [[Sufism]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 140</ref> Various Sufi [[tariqa|orders]] were founded in the 8th century and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in [[Akhmim]] in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. p. 26</ref>\n\nDhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of [[Gnosis]] into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 164</ref> He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.<ref>El-Daly, p. 112</ref>\n\n[[File:Al Azhar1.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Azhar Mosque]] founded in AD 970 by the Fatimids]]\n[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.04.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque of Abu Haggag]] built in the 11th century over the ruins of a pharaonic temple.

In time the power of the Arabs waned throughout the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] so that in the 10th century, the Turkish [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshids]] were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire.\n\nEgyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] of Arabic, which was to eventually slowly supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language.\n\n[[Al-Azhar]] was founded in AD 970 in the new capital [[Cairo]], not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper\n\nThe [[Mamluks of Egypt]] (AD 1258\u20131517)  as a whole were,  some of the most enlightened rulers of Egypt, not only in the arts and in providing for the welfare of their subjects, but also in many other ways, such as efficient organisation of law and order and postal services, and the building of canals, roads, bridges and aqueducts.<ref>[http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/world_history/A_Short_History_of_Egypt.pdf A Short History of Egypt \u2013 to about 1970 from University of Standford]\n</ref> Though turbulent, often treacherous and brutal in their feuds, and politically and economically inept, the later Mameluks maintained the splendour and artistic traditions of their predecessors. The reign of Kait Bey (1468-1496) was one of high achievement in architecture, showing great refinement of taste in the building of elegant tombs, mosques and palaces. It was a period in which learning flourished.\n\nTheir rule is generally {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered. By the 15th century most Egyptians had already been converted to Islam, while Coptic Christians were reduced to a minority.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape|first1=Bego\u00f1a|last1=Dobon|first2=Hisham Y.|last2=Hassan|first3=Hafid|last3=Laayouni|first4=Pierre|last4=Luisi|first5=Isis|last5=Rica\u00f1o-Ponce|first6=Alexandra|last6=Zhernakova|first7=Cisca|last7=Wijmenga|first8=Hanan|last8=Tahir|first9=David|last9=Comas|first10=Mihai G.|last10=Netea|first11=Jaume|last11=Bertranpetit|date=28 May 2015|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|pages=9996|doi=10.1038/srep09996|pmid=26017457|pmc=4446898}}</ref><ref>Jankowski, p. 35</ref> The Mamluks were mainly ethnic [[Circassians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] who had been captured as slaves then recruited into the army fighting on behalf of the Islamic empire. Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]]. Historian James Jankwoski writes:{{quote|Ultimately, Mamluk rule rested on force. The chronicles of the period are replete with examples of Mamluk violence against the indigenous population of Egypt...From horseback, they simply terrorized those lesser breeds who crossed their paths. The sudden and arbitrary use of force by the government and its dominant military elite; frequent resort to cruelty to make a point; ingenious methods of torture employed both for exemplary purpose and to extract wealth from others: all these measures were routine in the Mamluk era. Egypt under the Mamluks was not a very secure place to live.<ref>''A Short History of Egypt'', p. 47</ref>}}\n\n===Ottoman period===\nEgyptians under the [[Ottoman Turks]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term ''atrak'' (Turks) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk [[Bey]]s took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim '''ulama'' or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt, native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt, particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha.\n\n{{quote|From the Egyptian side, literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam, but retained an awareness of Egypt's distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world, as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor...

The [[French people|French]] defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], and soon they were able to seize control of the country.\n\nThe French occupation was short-lived, ending when [[British Empire|British]] troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence.\n\nWhen Napoleon invited the Egyptian ''ulama'' to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]'', was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition.\n\nThe withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], an Ottoman officer of [[Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim ''ulama'' as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar-cane]]), increased industrialization, and a new educational system\u2014the results of which are felt to this day.<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\">Jankowskil, p. 74</ref>\n\nIn order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the [[Levant]], [[Sudan]] and against the [[Wahhabism|Wahabis]] in [[Arabia]].<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\"/> Many Egyptians student missions were sent to Europe in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.\n\n====Nationalism====\n[[File:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]], 1801\u20131873, laid the groundwork for the modern Egyptian Renaissance.]]\nThe period between 1860\u20131940 was characterized by an Egyptian ''nahda'', renaissance or rebirth. It is best known for the renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\">Vatikiotis, p. 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe first Egyptian renaissance intellectual was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]]. In 1831, Tahtawi undertook a career in journalism, education and translation. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral [[philosophy]]. In them he introduces his students to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or \"good Egyptian\"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\"/>\n\nTahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. He also co-founded with his contemporary [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]], the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like [[Suyuti]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Maqrizi]], who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities.<ref>El-Daly, p. 29</ref> Tahtawi encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]] who had enlisted the [[Greeks]]' help in organizing the Egyptian army.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Silk weavers.JPG|thumb|Egyptian silk weavers during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]], 1880.]]\nAmong Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was [[Isma'il Pasha]] who became [[khedive]] in 1863. Ismail's reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Khedivial Opera House|Royal Opera House]], the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt, including villages, which meant that native Egyptians came to exert increasing political and economic influence over their country.<ref>Jankowski, p. 83</ref> Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of [[constitutionalism]] made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of Turks, Greeks, [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIsmail's massive modernization campaign, however, left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in local affairs. This led to the formation of secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 135</ref>\n\nWhen the British deposed of Ismail and installed his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfik]], the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by Minister of War [[Ahmed Urabi]], self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|military failure]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Mohammed Ali family]] ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place.\n\n====Liberal age====\n{{Main|Liberalism in Egypt}}\n[[File:Mustafa Kamil.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] (1874\u22121908), an anti-colonial nationalist famous for coining the phrase, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one\".]]\nEgyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 189</ref>\n\nSheikh [[Muhammad Abduh]], the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar [[Mufti]], was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the [[modernism|modernist]] interpretations of [[Islam]] that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.\"\n\nEgyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 [[Dinshaway Incident]], when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-[[colonialism|colonial]] resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal ''Umma'' (the Nation, 1907) headed by [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and the more radical, pro-Islamic ''Watani'' Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of [[Ad Daqahliyah|Daqahliya]] in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: \"El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.\"<ref>qtd. in Vatikiotis, p. 227</ref>\n\nBoth the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]]) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] and the People's Party. Prominent among these was [[Saad Zaghlul]] who led the new movement through the [[Wafd Party]]. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to [[Malta]], the Egyptian people staged their [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.<ref>Jankowski, p. 112</ref>\n\nThe Wafd Party drafted a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|new Constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the radical [[Misr El-Fatah (Young Egypt) Party|Young Egypt Party]]. In 1920, [[Banque Misr]] (Bank of Egypt) was founded by [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] as \"an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only\",<ref>qtd. in Jankowski p. 123</ref> which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.\n\n[[File:Farouk family official.jpg|thumb|[[King Farouk I]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida]] and their first-born daughter [[Princess Farial of Egypt|Princess Ferial]] c. 1940.]]\nUnder the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], were [[Qasim Amin]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Abbas Al-Akkad|Abbas el-'Akkad]], [[Tawfiq al-Hakeem|Tawfiq el-Hakeem]], and [[Salama Moussa]]. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]], an [[evolution]]ary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.<ref>Jankowski, p. 130</ref> This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a [[Golden Age]] of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage.\n\nWhen Egyptian novelist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]] died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had died. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as ''Mon \u00c9gypte'', Mahfouz had this to say:\n\n{{quote|Egypt is not just a piece of land. Egypt is the inventor of civilisation ... The strange thing is that this country of great history and unsurpassed civilisation is nothing but a thin strip along the banks of the Nile ... This thin strip of land created moral values, launched the concept of monotheism, developed arts, invented science and gave the world a stunning administration. These factors enabled the Egyptians to survive while other cultures and nations withered and died ... Throughout history Egyptians have felt that their mission is to tend to life. They were proud to turn the land green, to make it blossom with life. The other thing is that Egyptians invented morality long before the major religions appeared on earth. Morality is not just a system for control but a protection against chaos and death ... Egypt gave Islam a new voice. It didn't change the basic tenets of Islam, but its cultural weight gave Islam a new voice, one it didn't have back in Arabia. Egypt embraced an Islam that was moderate, tolerant and non-extremist. Egyptians are very pious, but they know how to mix piety with joy, just as their ancestors did centuries ago. Egyptians celebrate religious occasions with flair. For them, religious festivals and the month of Ramadan are occasions to celebrate life.<ref>Salmawy, Mohamed.

The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new regime.<ref>Jankowski, p. 137</ref>\n\nNasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and began a [[nationalization]] process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society.

Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat revived an ''Egypt Above All'' orientation, switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike.\n\nEgyptians fought one last time in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|October War]] in an attempt to liberate Egyptian territories captured by Israel six years earlier. The October War presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel leading to the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords|peace treaty]], which was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians,<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 443</ref> in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat was [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassinated]] in [[Cairo]] by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] in 1981, and was succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].\n\nHosni Mubarak was the president from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011, when he resigned under pressure of [[2011 Egyptian protests|popular protest]]. Although power was ostensibly organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], in practice it rested almost solely with the president. In late February 2005, for the first time since the 1952 coup d'\u00e9tat, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates, most prominently [[Ayman Nour]].

In antiquity, Egyptians spoke the [[Egyptian language]]. It constitutes its own branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. The [[Coptic language]] is the direct descendant of the Egyptian language, written in [[Coptic alphabet]]. It is worth noting that other languages, such as Nubian, Arabic, and other Libyan languages also existed in Egypt outside of the Nile valley and in the mountains surrounding it since at least the time of Herodotus, with Arabic being used mainly in the [[Eastern Desert]] and [[Sinai (peninsula)|Sinai]] <ref name=\"RAWLINSON p9\">The History of Herodotus By GEORGE RAWLINSON, Page 9</ref>, Nubian (referred to as Ethiopian By Herodotus) South of the first cataract of the Nile <ref>The History of Herodotus By GEORGE RAWLINSON, Page 33</ref>, and other Libyan Languages in the [[Libyan]] Desert<ref name=\"RAWLINSON p9\"/>\n\nAlthough Arabic was spoken in parts of Egypt in the pre-islamic era such as the Eastern Desert and Sinai<ref name=\"RAWLINSON p9\"/>, Coptic was the Language of the majority of Egyptians residing in the Nile Valley.

It is represented in a body of [[vernacular literature]] comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Classical Arabic]] is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.\n\nWhile the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language, it has also been influenced by many other languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and the old [[Egyptian language]]. This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions, including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion. As each nation came and went, the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language among the [[Arab world]]. This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread.

That contributed to forming an early sense of a collective imagined community among Arab soldiers as opposed to Turks, Kurds, and Albanians. Throughout the Ottoman Empire, all Arabic speakers, especially Muslims, were viewed as Arabs. As a consequence, being \"Arab\" was equivalent to being Egyptian in modern day. In an attempt to prove to his soldiers that he is one of them, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of Mohammed Ali Pasha, who was an [[Albanians|Albanian]], told one of his soldiers after criticizing Turks: \"I am not a Turk, I came to Egypt when I was a child, and since that time, its sun has changed my blood, and I became fully Arab\".<ref>All the Pasha's Men, Arabic Version, P 337</ref>\n\n===British Rule===\nBeginning 1860, the state started making efforts to shape a collective Egyptian Identity, and the word \"Misreyeen\" started slowly replacing the word \"Evlad Arab\".

Especially after the British occupation of Egypt which brought a westernized style of education with it. Among the western ideas, the French Enlightenment notion of reviving Pre-Christian civilizations and cultures found a special place among Egyptian Nationalists {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}, who sought to revive the Pharaonic culture as the main Pre-Islamic civilization of Egypt. Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as \"Pharaonism\"). After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain, other forms of nationalism developed, including secular [[Arab nationalism]] as well as [[Islamism]].\n\n\"Pharaonism\" rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation, as Egypt developed separately from the [[Arab world]]. A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean civilization]].

In particular, the growth of [[Zionism]] in neighboring Palestine was seen as a threat by many Egyptians and the cause of resistance there was adopted by rising Islamic movements such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] as well as the political leadership including [[Faruq I|King Faruq I]] and Prime Minister [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]].<ref name=\"Hinnesbusch\"/>.\n\n===Nasserism===\nIt was not until the [[Nasser era]] more than a decade later that Arab nationalism, and by extension [[Arab socialism]], became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world,<ref>\"Before Nasser, Egypt, which had been ruled by Britain since 1882, was more in favor of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan-Arab ideology.

Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives, and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics.<ref>Dawisha, p. 237.</ref> Although the Arabism instilled in the country by Nasser was not deeply embedded in society, a certain kinship with the rest of the Arab world was firmly established and Egypt saw itself as the leader of this larger cultural entity. Nasser's version of [[pan-Arabism]] stressed Egyptian sovereignty and leadership of Arab unity instead of the eastern Arab states.<ref name=\"Hinnesbusch94\"/>\n\nNasser's successor [[Anwar el-Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with Israel, revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. According to Dawisha, the terms \"Arab\", \"Arabism\" and \"Arab unity\", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.<ref>Dawisha, pp. 264\u201365, 267</ref> (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Republic]] sections.) However, despite Sadat's systematic attempts to root out Arab sentiment, Arab nationalism in Egypt remained a potent force.<ref name=\"Barakat4\"/>\n\nDuring this era, in 1978, Egyptian-American sociologist [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] studied the national discourse between 17 Egyptian intellectuals relating to Egypt's identity and peace with Israel. He noted that in 18 articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict]] opposed, while in eight articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality supported and only in three articles written by author [[Louis Awad]] was Arab identity rejected and neutrality supported.<ref name=\"Barakat5\"/> Egyptian scholar [[Gamal Hamdan]] stressed that Egyptian identity was unique, but that Egypt was the center and \"cultural hub\" of the Arab world, arguing that \"Egypt in the Arab world is like Cairo in Egypt.\" Hamdan further contended \"We do not see the Egyptian personality, no matter how distinct it may be, as anything other than a part of the personality of the greater Arab homeland.\"<ref name=\"Barakat4\">Barakat, p. 4.</ref>\n\nMany Egyptians today feel that Egyptian and Arab identities are inextricably linked, and emphasize the central role that Egypt plays in the Arab world. Others continue to believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage, culture and independent polity, pointing to the perceived failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies. Egyptian anthropologist Laila el-Hamamsy illustrates the modern-day relationship between the two trends, stating: \"in light of their history, Egyptians ... should be conscious of their national identity and consider themselves, above all, Egyptians. How is the Egyptian, with this strong sense of Egyptian identity, able to look himself as an Arab too?\"<ref>Barakat, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Her explanation is that Egyptianization translated as Arabization with the result being \"an increased tempo of Arabization, for facility in the Arabic language opened the windows into the rich legacy of Arabic culture. ... Thus in seeking a cultural identity, Egypt has revived its Arab cultural heritage.\"<ref name=\"Barakat5\">Barakat, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Egypt}}\n{{See also|Ancient Egypt}}\nEgyptian culture boasts five millennia of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the [[Near East]] and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christianity]] and [[Muslim culture|Islamic]] culture. Today, many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself influenced by Ancient Egypt.\n\n==Surnames==\n[[File:Zangaki. 0263. Chech arab.jpg|thumb|An Egyptian elder, 1860s]] \nToday, Egyptians carry names that have Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, Greek and Western meanings (especially Coptic ones) among others. The concept of a [[surname]] is lacking in Egypt. Rather, Egyptians tend to carry their father's name as their first middle name, and stop at the 2nd or 3rd first name, which thus becomes one's surname. In this manner, surnames continuously change with generations, as first names of 4th or 5th generations get dropped.\n[[File:Charmeur des serpents 1860s.jpg|thumb|A serpent charmer in Egypt, 1860s]]\n\nSome Egyptians tend to have Surnames based on their cities, like ''Monoufi'' (from [[Monufia]]), ''Banhawy'' (from [[Benha]]), ''Aswany'' (from [[Aswan]]), ''Tahtawy'' (from [[Tahta]]), ''Fayoumi'' (from [[Fayoum]]), ''Sakandary / Eskandrani'' (from [[Alexandria]]) and so on. \n\nAs a result of the Long Islamic history of Egypt, and as a result of several mass migration waves into Egypt such as the [[Banu Hilal]] Exodus. Some Egyptian muslims carry historical Arabic last names. For example the surname \"Al Sharif\" (The Noble) from the Ashraf tribes \"Al Juhaini\", from Juhainah, \"Al Qarmouti\" from Al Qaramita, \"Al Hawary\" from Hawara.\n\nOther people have their family names based on their traditional crafts, like ''El Nagar'' ([[Carpenter]]), ''El Fawal'' (the one who sells [[Ful medames|Foul]]), ''El Hadad'' ([[Blacksmith]]), ''El Khayat'' ([[Tailor]]) and so on. \n\nThe Majority of people, however, have surnames that used to be their great grand parents first names, this habit is especially dominant among the fellahin, where Surnames isn't really strong tradition. For example, if a person named Khaled Mohamed Ali has a son named Ashraf, his son's full name may become Ashraf Khaled Mohamed. Thus, a son may have a different last name than his father.\n\nHowever,It is not entirely unusual for families to have Ancient Egyptian based names (especially Coptic ones) and have their first names or surnames beginning with the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] masculine possessive [[pronoun]] ''pa'' (generally ''ba'' in Arabic, which lost the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the course of developing from [[Proto-Semitic]]). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) \"of Fayyoum\", Fayyoum meaning \"of the big water (yom)\", Basyouni (of [[Aswan]]), Bashandi, Bakhoum (\"the eagle\"), Bekhit, Bahur (\"of [[Horus]]\") and Banoub (\"of [[Anubis]]\").\n\nThe name Shenouda, which is very common among [[Copt]], means \"child of God\". Hence, names and many [[toponym]]s may end with ''-nouda'', ''-noudi'' or ''-nuti'', which means ''Of God'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as Minyawi from [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] and [[Suyuti]] from [[Asyut]]; or from one of the local [[Sufi]] orders such as el-Shazli and el-Sawy. More examples of prominent surnames are [[Qozman]] and [[Habib]].\n\nWith the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and [[Arabization|Arabized]], meaning they were altered to sound [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix ''-ios'' to Egyptian names; for example, Pakhom to Pakhomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article ''el'' to names such as Baymoui to el-Bayoumi.\n\nNames starting with the [[Ancient Egyptian]] affix ''pu'' (\"of the place of\") were sometimes Arabized to ''abu'' (\"father of\"); for example, Busiri (\"of the place of [[Osiris]]\") occasionally became [[Abusir]] and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shamy (\"the Levantine\") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Dewidar indicating an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri (\"the Egyptian\") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are more likely to retain indigenous names given their relative isolation throughout the Egyptian people's history.\n\nWith [[French people|French]] influence, names like [[Mounier]], [[Pierre]], and many others became common, particularly in the Christian community.\n\n==Genetic history==\n{{main article|DNA history of Egypt}}\n{{see also|Population history of Egypt}}\nBeginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]], some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]] pattern north to south.<ref>Batrawi A (1945).

[the] [[Badari|Badarian people]], who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a [Nile Valley] continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-[Nile Valley] population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct Afro-Asiatic African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.\"<ref>Frank Yurco, \"An Egyptological Review\" in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, eds. ''Black Athena Revisited''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996. p. 62-100</ref></blockquote>\n\nA 2006 [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] study on the dental [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[ancient Egyptians]] by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n and southern European populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which clustered very closely with the [[Badarian]] series of the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:\n<blockquote>[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced [[dentition]]s that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a\u2013c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing [[phenetic]] distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD \u00bc 0.050), 11\u201312th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th\u201330th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... [[Gebel Ramlah]] [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from [[Badari]] based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.<ref>Irish pp. 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nA study published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from Abusir. The study was able to measure the mitochondrial DNA of 90 individuals, and it showed that [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptians]] had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern ([[Arabs]], [[Levant|Levantine]] and [[Anatolia|Anatolian]]) and [[North Africa|North African]] populations and had significantly more affinity with south-eastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Genome-wide data could only be successfully extracted from three of these individuals. Of these three, the Y-chromosome haplogroups of two individuals could be assigned to the Middle-Eastern haplogroup J, and one to haplogroup E1b1b1 common in North Africa. The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African ancestry in these three individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is slightly lower than the level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in Egyptians from Abusir, who range from 14 to 21%. The study's authors cautioned that the Mummies may be unrepresentative of the whole Ancient Egyptian population, since they were recovered from the northern part of Egypt and that the Southern part might have more Sub-Saharan component being closer to [[Nubia]].<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999|bibcode=2017NatCo...815694S}}</ref> and that they only dated from the late New Kingdom to the Roman Period.

Aviram Dahan travels to Texas to kill al-Masih, but cannot bring himself to pull the trigger when face to face with him; he is caught in the act on camera by Eva Geller, who races after him. Al-Masih walks past Dahan and hears a wounded dog crying out, following the sound. The dog's owner prepares to shoot the dog, but his son begs al-Masih for a miracle. Instead, al-Masih takes the gun and shoots the dog himself, to the exasperation of the child. Geller, startled at the gun shot, finally catches up with Dahan, and is bewildered to see both Dahan and al-Masih still alive. She demands he tell her what happened, but he doesn't.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = We Will Not All Sleep\n |DirectedBy      = Kate Woods\n |WrittenBy       = Michael Petroni & Michael Bond\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = {{Plot|episode|date=January 2020}}Al-Masih wakes Rev. Iguero, telling him that it's time for them to go, demanding Rev. Iguero choose the destination. A conflicted Rev. Iguero decides to uproot his family, much to the chagrin of his wife, Anna ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]), though to the delight of his daughter. Rev. Iguero leads a convoy out of Dilley, Texas which soon grows to hundreds of cars. Eva Geller finally learns al-Masih's real name from a mysterious source named \"Q\": Payam Golshiri. She heads back to Texas to follow al-Masih, who the media incorrectly report is leading the convoy. She theorizes that al-Masih's plan is to cause \"social disruption\" because he quoted a book by one of his professors, who was an American, but defected to Russia, during an interrogation. Finally deciding to go to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], the American capitol, al-Masih preaches a sermon in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool]] and, in full view of everyone, he then turns and [[Jesus walking on water|walks on the water]] of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]] to the astonishment of the crowd, many of whom record the event from hundreds of cell phones.

Samir, along with many others who defected from the teachings of al-Masih, end up in a compound in the [[Badia Desert]] led by a man who thinks al-Masih is [[al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]; while Jibril, remaining faithful to al-Masih, ends up in [[Ramallah]], greeted as a liberator. Meanwhile, the highest levels of the American government are concerned over the popularity of al-Masih, with the [[White House Chief of Staff]] ([[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]]) demanding the CIA do more to \"discredit\" him. A prostitute is sent to seduce al-Masih at his hotel, but al-Masih recognizes her as having been paid to discredit him.

The next day, al-Masih reveals to the media that the meeting took place, to the anger of Rev. Iguero, who is not informed beforehand. Later, Rev. Iguero's daughter reveals to him that her mother, Anna, took her to [[Austin, Texas]] for a secret abortion; this is against Rev. Iguero's [[anti-abortionist]] beliefs, which he believed his wife shared. His daughter also reveals that al-Masih has been having semi-secret meetings with her, and that al-Masih came to Texas for her, not Rev. Iguero. Later, al-Masih tries to convince Anna Iguero to let \"her [daughter] go\" to be \"her own person\".

Meanwhile, Rev. Iguero asks televangelist Edmund DeGuilles ([[Beau Bridges]]) to have al-Masih on his program, without first asking al-Masih. Al-Masih agrees, but only if Rev. Iguero will bring along his daughter. Eva Geller is shocked to learn that her own father ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) believes al-Masih to be the end times Messiah, and her father compares her to her own mother, who miscarried many times but never gave up trying to conceive. In anger, Geller reveals that she miscarried the last egg fertilized via [[in-vitro fertilization]] from her deceased husband, and that there is no further hope; leaving the house, she goes to the hotel and then has sex with Aviram Dahan, who had in previous episodes made his desire for her obvious. It is revealed that the compound in the Badia is a terrorist training camp, and that Samer is to play the part of a [[suicide bomber]]. While Jibril gives his speech, Samer enters the mosque, shows the explosives tied to his chest, and raises the button. Staring into the eyes of Jibril, he cannot bring himself to pull the trigger; however, the bomb vest is remotely activated by Samer's terrorist mentor. Meanwhile, now back in the good graces of the Mossad, Dahan abducts al-Massih before he can appear on television in a manner similar to the real life Mossad abduction of [[Mordechai Vanunu]], and they make their way to the airport in a black SUV.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = The Wages of Sin\n |DirectedBy      = James McTeigue\n |WrittenBy       = Michael Petroni\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = The White House Chief of Staff decides to leak al-Masih's real name to the press, and that al-Masih was brought up by an illusionist, which causes dismay among al-Masih's followers. Meanwhile, Eva Geller catches wind of the fact that al-Masih has been abducted, despite having been granted asylum in the United States. The CIA tracks the \"diplomatic jet\" as it flies back to the Middle East. In the sky, al-Masih talks to Aviram urging him to free his conscience and that God loves him anyway, that every moment is useful to choose, choose Good or evil and that the last thing he will see before he dies will be the face of the boy he killed in Megiddo. Suddenly the plane begins experiencing severe [[turbulence]] and its lights go off. A fearful Dahan looks into the eyes of al-Masih, who seems not at all concerned; the plane crashes while Eva Geller is tracking it. Geller confronts the President's Chief of Staff for leaking [[classified information]], and accuses him of orchestrating the crash. Meanwhile, a very young shepherd comes across the crash site, which is surrounded by [[poppy|poppies]] despite being in the desert, where he claims to have seen al-Masih raise Dahan, along with another man, from the dead. A shocked Dahan peers out across the desert, and sees one of the other passengers on his knees kissing al-Masih's hand.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn November 17, 2017, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/messiah-netflix-orders-drama-series-mark-burnett-roma-downey-james-mcteigue-direct-1202208898/|title='Messiah': Netflix Orders Religious Drama Series From Mark Burnett & Roma Downey|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=November 16, 2017|work=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=January 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090921/https://deadline.com/2017/11/messiah-netflix-orders-drama-series-mark-burnett-roma-downey-james-mcteigue-direct-1202208898/|archive-date=March 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The series was created by [[Michael Petroni]] who is also credited as an executive producer and lead showrunner of the series.

After a month long sandstorm breaks ISIS's supply chains, they retreat and the city is saved. Then the preacher, who people take to calling [[Messiah|al-Masih]], leads hundreds of his followers into the desert, all the way until the border with the [[Golan Heights]], a journey of around {{Convert|65|km|mi}}. Al-Masih walks over the barbed wire fence and is arrested by the [[Israel Border Police]]. Jailed, al-Masih is interrogated by Aviram Dahan ([[Tomer Sisley]]), who is presumably in the [[Mossad]]; he also refuses to provide a real name. Al-Masih turns the tables on Dahan, revealing his name and other facts Dahan feels he could not reasonably be expected to know. Dahan terminates the interrogation and leaves the room. He returns in the early morning hours, but is shocked to find that al-Masih had escaped from detention.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Tremor\n |DirectedBy      = James McTeigue\n |WrittenBy       = Michael Petroni & Bruce Marshall Romans\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = With al-Masih having escaped, an international incident is brewing as the people he led to Israel's border starve; when news of his escape reaches them, they receive further resolve to stay. The American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] steps in to help the Israeli authorities find al-Masih and figure out who he is, led by Eva Geller ([[Michelle Monaghan]]). After Dahan thinks he sees him, but instead it's just a look-alike, al-Masih resurfaces at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] [no, it was Dome of the Rock]in Jerusalem. He preaches a sermon to the crowd, including apocalyptic phrases like \"history has ended\". His sermon is interrupted by the [[Israel Police|Israeli police]], who move to capture al-Masih, but fail to do so after a gun is heard to go off and it seems a boy is shot. Al-Masih [[laying on of hands|lays hands]] on the boy, who rises unharmed.  A bloody bullet is shown to the crowd. Many Muslims view this as a miracle.

A video of al-Masih is intercepted by the CIA, who set up a social media blockade. Al-Masih enters the preacher's home as a guest, but soon a [[Joint Terrorism Task Force|federal agent]] (JTTF) arrives at the scene, enters the church, and arrests al-Masih. Iguero vows to get al-Masih out of jail, and calls in a favor with a friend to get an [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] lawyer on the case. Geller arrives in Texas to interrogate al-Masih, learning on the way that he arrived via [[Quetzalc\u00f3atl International Airport]], in Mexico, on a [[charter plane]] flying from [[Jordan]]. She demands that the JTTF allow her to speak to the detained al-Masih, but al-Masih's lawyer prevents that from happening.

She then leaves the facility, and the JTTF tips off Eva Geller about that, who despite having had a miscarriage, rushes in to see him. Once again, al-Masih turns the tables on his interrogator by revealing he knows her name, and that both her mother and husband are deceased. Back in her hotel room, she has a call with her boss, who reveals that Israel is seeking to extradite al-Masih, and that the State's attorney will argue that this be allowed. Eva Geller goes to see al-Masih's lawyer, trying to convince her to stop fighting al-Masih's detention, to keep him out of Israel. At the trial, the State argues that al-Masih is lying about being a Muslim, to which he replies that he \"walks with all men\". In a shock decision delivered the next day, the Court decides to grant \"Mr. Masih\" [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]], which permits al-Masih to walk out of the court room a free man into a waiting car driven by Rev.

The refugees are faring badly however, and soon Samer questions why Jibril has so much faith, calling him \"mad\" for not seeking medical care elsewhere as his injuries could kill him. The CIA follows al-Masih and Rev. Iguero back to Dilley, Texas, where Americans from all over begin congregating to be close to al-Masih.  Al-Masih stays in a small tent, attended only by Rev. Iguero.  When Iguero asks him what to do next, al-Masih tells him that he needs to listen to God. Aviram Dahan travels to Texas to kill al-Masih, but cannot bring himself to pull the trigger when face to face with him; he is caught in the act on camera by Eva Geller, who races after him. Al-Masih walks past Dahan and hears a wounded dog crying out, following the sound. The dog's owner prepares to shoot the dog, but his son begs al-Masih for a miracle. Instead, al-Masih takes the gun and shoots the dog himself, to the exasperation of the child. Geller, startled at the gun shot, finally catches up with Dahan, and is bewildered to see both Dahan and al-Masih still alive. She demands he tell her what happened, but he doesn't.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = We Will Not All Sleep\n |DirectedBy      = Kate Woods\n |WrittenBy       = Michael Petroni & Michael Bond\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = {{Plot|episode|date=January 2020}}Al-Masih wakes Rev. Iguero, telling him that it's time for them to go, demanding Rev. Iguero choose the destination. A conflicted Rev. Iguero decides to uproot his family, much to the chagrin of his wife, Anna ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]), though to the delight of his daughter. Rev. Iguero leads a convoy out of Dilley, Texas which soon grows to hundreds of cars. Eva Geller finally learns al-Masih's real name from a mysterious source named \"Q\": Payam Golshiri. She heads back to Texas to follow al-Masih, who the media incorrectly report is leading the convoy. She theorizes that al-Masih's plan is to cause \"social disruption\" because he quoted a book by one of his professors, who was an American, but defected to Russia, during an interrogation. Finally deciding to go to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], the American capitol, al-Masih preaches a sermon in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool]] and, in full view of everyone, he then turns and [[Jesus walking on water|walks on the water]] of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]] to the astonishment of the crowd, many of whom record the event from hundreds of cell phones.  At the same time as al-Masih walks on the water, in the Golan Heights, Jibril, who had been experiencing vivid visions of his deceased mother and al-Masih, strips nude and walks up to and then over the Israeli border, leading the other refugees behind him&mdash;an event likewise widely photographed.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = It Came to Pass as It Was Spoken\n |DirectedBy      = Kate Woods\n |WrittenBy       = Eoghan O'Donnell\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = The world is abuzz after al-Masih's miracle, with even the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] investigating. Samir, along with many others who defected from the teachings of al-Masih, end up in a compound in the [[Badia Desert]] led by a man who thinks al-Masih is [[al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]; while Jibril, remaining faithful to al-Masih, ends up in [[Ramallah]], greeted as a liberator. Meanwhile, the highest levels of the American government are concerned over the popularity of al-Masih, with the [[White House Chief of Staff]] ([[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]]) demanding the CIA do more to \"discredit\" him. A prostitute is sent to seduce al-Masih at his hotel, but al-Masih recognizes her as having been paid to discredit him. They however manage to find al-Masih's brother, who tells them that they were raised by their uncle, a trained [[illusionist]].\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Force Majeure\n |DirectedBy      = Kate Woods\n |WrittenBy       = Eoghan O'Donnell\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = The [[President of the United States]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]) has a secret meeting with al-Masih; al-Masih demands the President withdraw all US troops from everywhere in the world, using the President's [[Mormon]] faith in a bid to convince him. The next day, al-Masih reveals to the media that the meeting took place, to the anger of Rev. Iguero, who is not informed beforehand. Later, Rev. Iguero's daughter reveals to him that her mother, Anna, took her to [[Austin, Texas]] for a secret abortion; this is against Rev. Iguero's [[anti-abortionist]] beliefs, which he believed his wife shared. His daughter also reveals that al-Masih has been having semi-secret meetings with her, and that al-Masih came to Texas for her, not Rev. Iguero. Later, al-Masih tries to convince Anna Iguero to let \"her [daughter] go\" to be \"her own person\".

Meanwhile, Rev. Iguero asks televangelist Edmund DeGuilles ([[Beau Bridges]]) to have al-Masih on his program, without first asking al-Masih. Al-Masih agrees, but only if Rev. Iguero will bring along his daughter. Eva Geller is shocked to learn that her own father ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) believes al-Masih to be the end times Messiah, and her father compares her to her own mother, who miscarried many times but never gave up trying to conceive. In anger, Geller reveals that she miscarried the last egg fertilized via [[in-vitro fertilization]] from her deceased husband, and that there is no further hope; leaving the house, she goes to the hotel and then has sex with Aviram Dahan, who had in previous episodes made his desire for her obvious. It is revealed that the compound in the Badia is a terrorist training camp, and that Samer is to play the part of a [[suicide bomber]]. While Jibril gives his speech, Samer enters the mosque, shows the explosives tied to his chest, and raises the button. Staring into the eyes of Jibril, he cannot bring himself to pull the trigger; however, the bomb vest is remotely activated by Samer's terrorist mentor. Meanwhile, now back in the good graces of the Mossad, Dahan abducts al-Massih before he can appear on television in a manner similar to the real life Mossad abduction of [[Mordechai Vanunu]], and they make their way to the airport in a black SUV.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = The Wages of Sin\n |DirectedBy      = James McTeigue\n |WrittenBy       = Michael Petroni\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = The White House Chief of Staff decides to leak al-Masih's real name to the press, and that al-Masih was brought up by an illusionist, which causes dismay among al-Masih's followers. Meanwhile, Eva Geller catches wind of the fact that al-Masih has been abducted, despite having been granted asylum in the United States. The CIA tracks the \"diplomatic jet\" as it flies back to the Middle East. In the sky, al-Masih talks to Aviram urging him to free his conscience and that God loves him anyway, that every moment is useful to choose, choose Good or evil and that the last thing he will see before he dies will be the face of the boy he killed in Megiddo. Suddenly the plane begins experiencing severe [[turbulence]] and its lights go off. A fearful Dahan looks into the eyes of al-Masih, who seems not at all concerned; the plane crashes while Eva Geller is tracking it. Geller confronts the President's Chief of Staff for leaking [[classified information]], and accuses him of orchestrating the crash. Meanwhile, a very young shepherd comes across the crash site, which is surrounded by [[poppy|poppies]] despite being in the desert, where he claims to have seen al-Masih raise Dahan, along with another man, from the dead. A shocked Dahan peers out across the desert, and sees one of the other passengers on his knees kissing al-Masih's hand.\n |LineColor       = E6DDD5\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn November 17, 2017, it was announced that [[Netflix]] had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/messiah-netflix-orders-drama-series-mark-burnett-roma-downey-james-mcteigue-direct-1202208898/|title='Messiah': Netflix Orders Religious Drama Series From Mark Burnett & Roma Downey|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=November 16, 2017|work=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=January 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090921/https://deadline.com/2017/11/messiah-netflix-orders-drama-series-mark-burnett-roma-downey-james-mcteigue-direct-1202208898/|archive-date=March 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The series was created by [[Michael Petroni]] who is also credited as an executive producer and lead showrunner of the series.

Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\n\n*[[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)\n*[[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)\n*[[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)\n\n=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:\n\n*[[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)\n*[[Joint Implementation]] (JI)\n*[[Emissions trading]]\n\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\n\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).\n\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\n\n* Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\n* Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.\n\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.\n\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).\n\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\">Callick, Rowan. \"Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions.\" The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\" />\n\n=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\n\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\n\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain\u2014from project developer to retailer.<ref name=\"ecosysmarket\">{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170031/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 August 2007|df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nWhile some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that [[forestry]] projects foster.\nProject types in the voluntary market range from avoided [[deforestation]], afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestration]], increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], fuel switching, [[Carbon capture and storage|methane capture]] from coal plants and [[Climate change and agriculture#Livestock|livestock]], and even [[renewable energy]]. Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) sold on the voluntary market are quite controversial due to [[Carbon credit#Additionality and its importance|additionality]] concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acore.org/renewableenergyinfo/includes/resource-files/bios.doc|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707112535/http://www.acore.org/renewableenergyinfo/includes/resource-files/bios.doc|archivedate=7 July 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 August 2007|df=dmy}}</ref> Industrial Gas projects receive criticism because such projects only apply to large industrial plants that already have high fixed costs. Siphoning off industrial gas for sequestration is considered picking the low hanging fruit; which is why credits generated from industrial gas projects are the cheapest in the voluntary market.\n\nThe size and activity of the voluntary carbon market are difficult to measure.

Finally, throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint, but it also adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition, mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas, methane.\n\nOptions to reduce the carbon footprint of humans include [[Waste hierarchy|Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse]]. This can be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones. If that option isn't available, it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use.<ref name=\"environment.about.com\">{{cite web|url=http://environment.about.com/od/globalwarming/tp/globalwarmtips.htm|title=Personal Steps You Can Take to Fight Global Warming|author=Larry West|work=About.com News & Issues}}</ref>{{reliable source|date=December 2012}} When one household recycles at least half of their household waste, they can save 1.2 tons of carbon dioxide annually.{{cite needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAnother option for reducing the [[carbon]] footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home.

By calculating or predicting a process\u2019 carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas.\n\n== Schemes to reduce carbon emissions: Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates ==\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, [[carbon offset]]s can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.\n\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a ''mandatory market'' and a ''voluntary market''. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\n\n*[[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)\n*[[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)\n*[[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)\n\n=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:\n\n*[[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)\n*[[Joint Implementation]] (JI)\n*[[Emissions trading]]\n\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\n\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).\n\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\n\n* Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\n* Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.\n\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.\n\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).\n\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\">Callick, Rowan. \"Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions.\" The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\" />\n\n=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\n\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\n\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain\u2014from project developer to retailer.<ref name=\"ecosysmarket\">{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170031/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 August 2007|df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nWhile some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that [[forestry]] projects foster.\nProject types in the voluntary market range from avoided [[deforestation]], afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestration]], increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], fuel switching, [[Carbon capture and storage|methane capture]] from coal plants and [[Climate change and agriculture#Livestock|livestock]], and even [[renewable energy]].

{"title_page": "Killing Me Softly with His Song", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|1971 song by Lori Lieberman}}\n\"'''Killing Me Softly with His Song'''\" is a song composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] with lyrics by [[Norman Gimbel]]. The lyrics were written in collaboration with [[Lori Lieberman]] after she was inspired by a [[Don McLean]] performance in late 1971. Lieberman released her version of the song in 1972, but it did not chart. In 1973 it became a number-one hit in the United States and Canada for [[Roberta Flack]], also reaching number six in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song has been covered by many artists; the version by [[Fugees]] won the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards|1997 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].\n\nAfter decades of confirming Lieberman's important contribution to the song, Fox and Gimbel changed their version of the origin story, to downplay Lieberman's role. Gimbel threatened McLean with a lawsuit in 2008, to remove words from his website saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly,\" but McLean dismissed the threat by showing Gimbel his own words confirming the inspiration, published in 1973. \n\n==Lori Lieberman version==\nAspiring musician [[Lori Lieberman]] was 19 years old in 1971 when she was introduced to veteran songwriter [[Norman Gimbel]] and composer [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]; the two men signed her to a management contract in which they would write her songs and manage her career, and take 20% of her income.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> The three shared a common Jewish heritage and Scorpio astrological signs, and they began to pool songwriting ideas.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/> Gimbel also began an [[affair]] with Lieberman, even though he was 24 years older and married. They kept the affair a secret for years.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn November 1971, Lieberman, now 20, went out with her friend Michele Willens to see [[Don McLean]] perform at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] nightclub in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\">{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/she-sang-killing-me-softly-before-roberta-flack-now-she-just-wants-you-to-hear-her-side-of-the-story/2020/01/23/9d9dcc7e-3b9d-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html |newspaper = The Washington Post |date = January 24, 2020 |last = Edgers |first = Geoff |title = She sang 'Killing Me Softly' before Roberta Flack.

After the concert, Lieberman phoned Gimbel to read him her napkin notes and share her experience of a singer reaching deep inside her world with his song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman's description reminded Gimbel of a song title that was already in his idea notebook, a title that contained \"killing\" and \"softly\".<ref name=Craft/> Gimbel expanded on Lieberman's notes, fleshing them out into song lyrics. Gimbel said in 1973 that \"Her conversation fed me, inspired me, gave me some language and a choice of words.\"<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Gimbel passed these lyrics to Fox, who set them to music.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/>\n\nLieberman recorded the song in late 1971 and released it as a single in 1972, produced by Gimbel and Fox. This version did not chart. Lieberman promoted the album by touring, and she always introduced the song \"Killing Me Softly\" by describing its origin in the McLean performance. Gimbel and Fox even wrote out for her this introduction of the song so that she could deliver it consistently at each performance. In 1973 in her first appearance on national television, Lieberman described this same origin story on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' after performing the song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> When Lieberman toured through Canada in 1974 to promote her second album, ''Billboard'' magazine carried a public relations piece from [[Capitol Records]] about the three-way \"song-producing team\" of Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox, including a description of the Don McLean performance inspiring the song \"Killing Me Softly\". Gimbel was quoted saying that he relied on Lieberman to inspire his songwriting creativity since he had passed the most creative days of his youth: \"Now I need a reason to write, and Lori is one of the best reasons a lyricwriter could have.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\">{{cite magazine |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 |page = 53 |title = The Lori Lieberman Team |date = June 24, 1974 |magazine = Billboard }}</ref>\n\nDon McLean said in 1973 that he was surprised to find out that the song described his singing. \"I'm absolutely amazed. I've heard both Lori's and Roberta's version and I must say I'm very humbled about the whole thing. You can't help but feel that way about a song written and performed as well as this one is.\"<ref name=\"nydn\">{{cite news |last = O'Haire |first = Patricia |url = https://don-mclean.com/2009/01/21/the-killing-me-softly-story/ |title = A Killer of a Song |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |location = New York |work = Daily News }}</ref>\n\n===Disputed origin===\nIn the 1970s both Gimbel and Fox were in agreement with Lieberman about the song's origin at a McLean concert. Sean Derek, who worked for Gimbel and Fox as an assistant in the 1970s, confirmed that the two men would tell the McLean origin story \"all the time\".<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> However, Gimbel and Fox changed their stories around 1997, to reduce or dismiss Lieberman's contribution.\n\nIn 1976, the Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox songwriting team turned sour. Gimbel had divorced his wife three years earlier, but Lieberman eventually stopped the sexual relationship she had with Gimbel because he \"had become emotionally abusive, controlling and unfaithful.\" She asked to be freed of her contract. Gimbel and Fox directed their lawyers to demand $27,000 from Lieberman to pay expenses, and to demand another $250,000 of her future income. Lieberman's lawyer, Frederic Ansis, recalled later that Gimbel and Fox could have been \"nice guys\" like other managers in the industry who released their unsuccessful artists, but they chose the other route.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nBy 1997, Lieberman had long severed her ties to Gimbel, but she reconnected with Fox, who attended a concert of hers.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' about her recent songwriting work. In this interview she said that when she was young, Gimbel and Fox had been \"very, very controlling. I felt like I was pushed on stage, and I was singing other people's material, although that material was based on my private diaries. I felt victimized for most of my early career.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/arts/living-in-the-shadow-of-a-famous-song.html |date = June 8, 1997 |title = Living in the Shadow of a Famous Song |last = Pond |first = Steve |page = 34 |newspaper = The New York Times }}</ref> Fox never spoke to her again after this revelation.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn 2008, Gimbel demanded that McLean remove text from his website, the text saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly\". McLean did not remove the text; instead, McLean's lawyer sent Gimbel a copy of a 1973 ''New York Daily News'' article in which Gimbel is quoted and seems to agree with Lieberman's account.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg</ref> In the article, Lieberman is asked how the song came about and what its inspiration was.<ref>{{cite news |last = O'Haire |first = Patricia |location = New York |work = Daily News |year = 1973 }}{{full|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\n{{quote|\"Don McLean,\" she said simply. \"I saw him at the Troubadour in LA last year. (\"And there he was this young boy / A stranger to my eyes\") I had heard about him from some friends but up to then all I knew about him really was what others had told me. But I was moved by his performance, by the way he developed his numbers, he got right through to me. (\"Strumming my pain with his fingers / Killing me softly with his song/ Telling my whole life with his words.\")}}\n\nGimbel's contribution supports Lieberman's stance:\n\n{{quote|\"Lori is only 20 and she really is a very private person,\" he said. \"She told us about this strong experience she had listening to McLean\" (\"I felt all flushed with fever / Embarrassed by the crowd / I felt he had found my letters / And read each one out loud / I prayed that he would finish / But he kept just right on\u2026\")\n\"I had a notion this might make a good song so the three of us discussed it. We talked it over several times, just as we did with the rest of the numbers we wrote for the album and we all felt it had possibilities.\"}}\n\nLieberman then adds:\n\n{{quote|\"Norman had a phrase he liked, 'killing me softly with his blues'\", Lori went on to explain. \"But I didn't feel the word \"blues\" was quite what the effect was. It wasn't contemporary enough, somehow. We talked about it a while and finally decided on the word \"song\" instead. It seemed right then when we did it.\"}} \n\nFox published a memoir in 2010, ''Killing Me Softly, My Life in Music'', which contained nothing about the McLean performance inspiring the song, and downplayed Lieberman's role in the songwriting team.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nWhen Dan MacIntosh of Songfacts asked Fox in 2010 about the McLean origin story, Fox said, \"I think it's called an urban legend. It really didn't happen that way.\" He described Gimbel and himself writing the song, then playing it for Lieberman later, who was reminded of McLean's singing. Fox said that \"somehow the words got changed around so that we wrote it based on Don McLean...\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/charles-fox |title = Charles Fox : Songwriter Interviews |first =  |last = Songfacts |website = www.songfacts.com |access-date = December 19, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nGimbel described in 2010 how he had been introduced to the [[Argentinian]]-born composer [[Lalo Schifrin]] (then of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' fame) and began writing songs to a number of Schifrin's films.<ref name=Craft/> Both Gimbel and Schifrin made a suggestion to write a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] together, and Schifrin gave Gimbel an Argentinean novel\u2014''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]\u2014to read as a possible idea.

song composed by [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]] with lyrics by [[Norman Gimbel]]. The lyrics were written in collaboration with [[Lori Lieberman]] after she was inspired by a [[Don McLean]] performance in late 1971. Lieberman released her version of the song in 1972, but it did not chart. In 1973 it became a number-one hit in the United States and Canada for [[Roberta Flack]], also reaching number six in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song has been covered by many artists; the version by [[Fugees]] won the [[39th Annual Grammy Awards|1997 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].\n\nAfter decades of confirming Lieberman's important contribution to the song, Fox and Gimbel changed their version of the origin story, to downplay Lieberman's role. Gimbel threatened McLean with a lawsuit in 2008, to remove words from his website saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly,\" but McLean dismissed the threat by showing Gimbel his own words confirming the inspiration, published in 1973. \n\n==Lori Lieberman version==\nAspiring musician [[Lori Lieberman]] was 19 years old in 1971 when she was introduced to veteran songwriter [[Norman Gimbel]] and composer [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charles Fox]]; the two men signed her to a management contract in which they would write her songs and manage her career, and take 20% of her income.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> The three shared a common Jewish heritage and Scorpio astrological signs, and they began to pool songwriting ideas.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/> Gimbel also began an [[affair]] with Lieberman, even though he was 24 years older and married. They kept the affair a secret for years.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn November 1971, Lieberman, now 20, went out with her friend Michele Willens to see [[Don McLean]] perform at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] nightclub in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/she-sang-killing-me-softly-before-roberta-flack-now-she-just-wants-you-to-hear-her-side-of-the-story/2020/01/23/9d9dcc7e-3b9d-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 24, 2020 |last=Edgers |first=Geoff |title=She sang 'Killing Me Softly' before Roberta Flack.

After the concert, Lieberman phoned Gimbel to read him her napkin notes and share her experience of a singer reaching deep inside her world with his song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman's description reminded Gimbel of a song title that was already in his idea notebook, a title that contained \"killing\" and \"softly\".<ref name=Craft/> Gimbel expanded on Lieberman's notes, fleshing them out into song lyrics. Gimbel said in 1973 that \"Her conversation fed me, inspired me, gave me some language and a choice of words.\"<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Gimbel passed these lyrics to Fox, who set them to music.<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\"/>\n\nLieberman recorded the song in late 1971 and released it as a single in 1972, produced by Gimbel and Fox. This version did not chart. Lieberman promoted the album by touring, and she always introduced the song \"Killing Me Softly\" by describing its origin in the McLean performance. Gimbel and Fox even wrote out for her this introduction of the song so that she could deliver it consistently at each performance. In 1973 in her first appearance on national television, Lieberman described this same origin story on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' after performing the song.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> When Lieberman toured through Canada in 1974 to promote her second album, ''Billboard'' magazine carried a public relations piece from [[Capitol Records]] about the three-way \"song-producing team\" of Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox, including a description of the Don McLean performance inspiring the song \"Killing Me Softly\". Gimbel was quoted saying that he relied on Lieberman to inspire his songwriting creativity since he had passed the most creative days of his youth: \"Now I need a reason to write, and Lori is one of the best reasons a lyricwriter could have.\"<ref name=\"Billboard 1974\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 |page=53 |title=The Lori Lieberman Team |date=June 24, 1974 |magazine=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nDon McLean said in 1973 that he was surprised to find out that the song described his singing. \"I'm absolutely amazed. I've heard both Lori's and Roberta's version and I must say I'm very humbled about the whole thing. You can't help but feel that way about a song written and performed as well as this one is.\"<ref name=\"nydn\">O'Haire, Patricia [https://don-mclean.com/2009/01/21/the-killing-me-softly-story/ \"A Killer of a Song] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg |date=2013-05-14 }},\" ''New York Daily News''</ref>\n\n===Disputed origin===\nIn the 1970s both Gimbel and Fox were in agreement with Lieberman about the song's origin at a McLean concert. Sean Derek, who worked for Gimbel and Fox as an assistant in the 1970s, confirmed that the two men would tell the McLean origin story \"all the time\".<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> However, Gimbel and Fox changed their stories around 1997, to reduce or dismiss Lieberman's contribution.\n\nIn 1976, the Lieberman/Gimbel/Fox songwriting team turned sour. Gimbel had divorced his wife three years earlier, but Lieberman eventually stopped the sexual relationship she had with Gimbel because he \"had become emotionally abusive, controlling and unfaithful.\" She asked to be freed of her contract. Gimbel and Fox directed their lawyers to demand $27,000 from Lieberman to pay expenses, and to demand another $250,000 of her future income. Lieberman's lawyer, Frederic Ansis, recalled later that Gimbel and Fox could have been \"nice guys\" like other managers in the industry who released their unsuccessful artists, but they chose the other route.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nBy 1997, Lieberman had long severed her ties to Gimbel, but she reconnected with Fox, who attended a concert of hers.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/> Lieberman was interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' about her recent songwriting work. In this interview she said that when she was young, Gimbel and Fox had been \"very, very controlling. I felt like I was pushed on stage, and I was singing other people's material, although that material was based on my private diaries. I felt victimized for most of my early career.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/arts/living-in-the-shadow-of-a-famous-song.html |date=June 8, 1997 |title=Living in the Shadow of a Famous Song |last=Pond |first=Steve |page=34 |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref> Fox never spoke to her again after this revelation.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nIn 2008, Gimbel demanded that McLean remove text from his website, the text saying that McLean was the inspiration for \"Killing Me Softly\". McLean did not remove the text; instead, McLean's lawyer sent Gimbel a copy of a 1973 ''New York Daily News'' article in which Gimbel is quoted and seems to agree with Lieberman's account.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130514165758/http://www.don-mclean.com/i/kill.jpg</ref> In the article, Lieberman is asked how the song came about and what its inspiration was.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia, ''New York Daily News'', 1973</ref> \n\n{{quote|\"Don McLean,\" she said simply. \"I saw him at the Troubadour in LA last year. (\"And there he was this young boy / A stranger to my eyes\") I had heard about him from some friends but up to then all I knew about him really was what others had told me. But I was moved by his performance, by the way he developed his numbers, he got right through to me. (\"Strumming my pain with his fingers / Killing me softly with his song/ Telling my whole life with his words.\")}}\n\nGimbel's contribution supports Lieberman's stance:\n\n{{quote|\"Lori is only 20 and she really is a very private person,\" he said. \"She told us about this strong experience she had listening to McLean\" (\"I felt all flushed with fever / Embarrassed by the crowd / I felt he had found my letters / And read each one out loud / I prayed that he would finish / But he kept just right on\u2026\")\n\"I had a notion this might make a good song so the three of us discussed it. We talked it over several times, just as we did with the rest of the numbers we wrote for the album and we all felt it had possibilities.\"}}\n\nLieberman then adds:\n\n{{quote|\"Norman had a phrase he liked, 'killing me softly with his blues'\", Lori went on to explain. \"But I didn't feel the word \"blues\" was quite what the effect was. It wasn't contemporary enough, somehow. We talked about it a while and finally decided on the word \"song\" instead. It seemed right then when we did it.\"}} \n\nFox published a memoir in 2010, ''Killing Me Softly, My Life in Music'', which contained nothing about the McLean performance inspiring the song, and downplayed Lieberman's role in the songwriting team.<ref name=\"WaPo Edgers 2020\"/>\n\nWhen Dan MacIntosh of Songfacts asked Fox in 2010 about the McLean origin story, Fox said, \"I think it's called an urban legend. It really didn't happen that way.\" He described Gimbel and himself writing the song, then playing it for Lieberman later, who was reminded of McLean's singing. Fox said that \"somehow the words got changed around so that we wrote it based on Don McLean...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/charles-fox|title=Charles Fox : Songwriter Interviews|first=|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nGimbel described in 2010 how he had been introduced to the [[Argentinian]]-born composer [[Lalo Schifrin]] (then of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' fame) and began writing songs to a number of Schifrin's films.<ref name=Craft/> Both Gimbel and Schifrin made a suggestion to write a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] together, and Schifrin gave Gimbel an Argentinean novel\u2014''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Hopscotch]]'' by [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]\u2014to read as a possible idea. The book was never made into a musical, but in chapter two, the narrator describes himself as sitting in a bar listening to an American pianist friend \"kill us softly with some blues\".<ref name=Craft>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Sheila|title=The Craft of Lyric Writing|publisher=Writers Digest Books|year=1984|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uVePZ1Qwtb0C&pg=PA13|accessdate=22 September 2010|isbn=0-89879-149-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cort\u00e1zar|first1=Julio|title=Hopscotch|url=https://archive.org/details/hopscotch0000cort|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1966|page=[https://archive.org/details/hopscotch0000cort/page/15 15]|isbn=0-394-75284-8}}</ref> Gimbel put the phrase in his notebook of song ideas for use at a future time.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.don-mclean.com/killingmesoftly.asp|title=The \"Killing Me Softly\" Story|publisher=Don-mclean.com|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=31 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519202841/http://www.don-mclean.com/killingmesoftly.asp|archivedate=19 May 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\nLieberman released a song in 2011 called \"Cup of Girl\" with lyrics about being used by someone who would \"rifle through her diary\" to write songs about her, who was dishonest, promiscuous and took advantage of her.

In October 1993 ''US Shoe Corp'' [[Cincinnati]] sold the seven of its [[LensCrafters]]' superstores in the [[United Kingdom]] to Vision Express. In 1995, the first store operating on a [[joint venture]] basis was opened.\n\nThe company had grown to over 220 stores across the United Kingdom by 2007. In May 2008 ''Batemans Opticians'' was acquired, which comprised a seventy five store chain in [[Southern England]]. The majority of these stores have since been rebranded as Vision Express.\n\nThere are currently 575 stores throughout the United Kingdom, [[Jersey]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Find your local Vision Express Opticians|url=http://www.visionexpress.com/opticians/}}</ref>  Of these stores approx. 195 are fully company owned,<ref name=\"AA\" /> with the remainder being under joint Venture partnerships.\n\nVision Express is also in [[Poland]], where it has over 110 stores. It has recently opened a series of stores in [[India]] in partnership with Reliance.\n\nOn 1 May 2013, Vision Express announced that it had acquired twelve optical stores from Crown Eyeglass Ltd. The stores, situated in the [[North West England|North West of England]], will become part of the Vision Express portfolio, bringing its total number of outlets in the United Kingdom and Ireland to 331.\n\nEight of the properties currently trading as Crown Optical Centre and Direkt Optik will transfer optical services to nearby Vision Express premises and Vision Express will seek to retain the valued experience of the Crown Eyeglass Ltd personnel within the Vision Express store network. The remaining four stores will trade from their existing locations, with their existing teams under Vision Express branding.\n\nOn 1 February 2014, the high street retail business of Rayner & Keeler Opticians was bought by Vision Express from ''JBR1910 Limited''.\n\nOn 1 December 2014 Vision Express announced the acquisition of the business of Liverpool-based ''Conlons Opticians'' for an undisclosed fee.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonough|first1=Tony|title=After 132 years in the same family Liverpool's Conlons Opticians is sold to Vision Express|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/after-132-years-same-family-8206268|work=Liverpool Echo|date=1 December 2014}}</ref> It was stated that ten of the nineteen stores purchased would continue to trade from their current locations, with the existing store teams as part of the Vision Express portfolio, with the remaining eight stores transferring services to their nearest Vision Express store.\n\nThe following day, it was announced that the store in Millom (which was due to be transferred to the nearby location of [[Barrow-In-Furness]]), would remain open following a review from local residents, bringing the total number of Vision Express stores to 390 by the end of 2014.\n\nFollowing a further announcement on 9 December 2014, Vision Express decided to continue to trade from the Conlons store in Annan as part of its portfolio. This increased the total number of stores to 391 by the end of 2014.\n\nDecember 2017 saw Vision Express announce the completion of the deal to incorporate 209 Tesco Opticians into their portfolio.  This increased the Vision Express store count (in the UK) to 600. By June 2018, all the Tesco Optician stores had been rebranded to VE@Tesco.\n\nBetween 24th and 25th of March 2020, Vision Express closed non-essential branches nationwide in response to the [[COVID-19|COVID-19 pandemic]]. Onur K\u00f6ksal, (CEO) began to initiate the [[furlough]] of all non-essential staff. \n\n==Takeover by Grand Vision==\nGrand Vision acquired Vision Express in 1997. The French parent company ''Grand Vision'' has stores under various brands across Europe, and the rest of the world. Under franchise agreement there is a strong '''Vision Express''' brand present also in [[Latvia]]n and [[Lithuania]]n markets. These shops were acquired from GrandVision by Latvian entrepreneurs of \"LU Optometrijas Centrs SIA\". Currently \"Vision Express\" brand in Latvia and Lithuania is operated as a part of OC VISION group.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n{{coord|52|53|03|N|1|08|36|W|display=title}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.visionexpress.com Vision Express website]\n* [https://www.visionexpress.in Vision Express India]\n* [https://www.visionexpress.lt Vision Express Lithuania]\n* [https://www.visionexpress.lv Vision Express Latvia]\n\n{{Eyewear retailers}}\n\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1988]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Nottinghamshire]]\n[[Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Eyewear retailers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Eyewear companies of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{third-party|date=February 2018}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox company\n | name             = Vision Express (UK) Limited\n | logo             = Vision-express-opticians-logo.svg\n | type             = [[Private Limited Company]]\n | genre            =\n | founded = {{start date and age|1988}}\n | founder          =\n | location_city    =\n | location_country =\n | location         = [[Ruddington]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]]\n | locations        = 600\n | area_served      = [[UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|ROI]], [[Jersey]]\n | key_people       = Onur K\u00f6skal (CEO)\n | industry         = Ophthalmic and dispensing opticians\n | products         = Spectacles, Contact lenses, Sunglasses, Eye Examinations\n | services         = Eye Exams, Contact Lens Assessments, Spectacles Dispensing\n | revenue          = {{increase}} \u00a3280m (2012)<ref name=\"AA\">Vision Express (UK) Ltd, ''Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012''.</ref>\n | operating_income = {{increase}} \u00a316.4m (2012)<ref name=\"AA\" />\n | assets           =\n | equity           =\n | owner            = HAL Trust (Bermuda) via [[Grand Vision|GrandVision SA]] (France)<ref name=\"AA\" />\n | num_employees    = 6000 apx (inc. joint venture partnerships)\n | parent           = Vision Express Group Ltd\n | divisions        =\n | subsid           = Abbeyfield V.E.
