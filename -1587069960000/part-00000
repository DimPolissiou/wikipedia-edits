The endoplasmic reticulum is found in most [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] and forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs known as [[cisterna]]e (in the RER), and tubular structures in the SER. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer [[nuclear membrane]]. The endoplasmic reticulum is not found in [[red blood cell]]s, or [[spermatozoa]].\n\nThe two types of ER share many of the same [[Protein|proteins]] and engage in certain common activities such as the synthesis of certain [[Lipid|lipids]] and [[cholesterol]]. Different types of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] contain different ratios of the two types of ER depending on the activities of the cell.\n\nThe outer ([[cytosol]]ic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with [[ribosome]]s that are the sites of [[protein synthesis]].

The endoplasmic reticulum is found in most [[eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] and forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs known as [[cisterna]]e (in the RER), and tubular structures in the SER. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer [[nuclear membrane]]. The endoplasmic reticulum is not found in [[red blood cell]]s, or [[spermatozoa]].\n\nThe two types of ER share many of the same [[Protein|proteins]] and engage in certain common activities such as the synthesis of certain [[Lipid|lipids]] and [[cholesterol]]. Different types of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] contain different ratios of the two types of ER depending on the activities of the cell.\n\nThe outer ([[cytosol]]ic) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with [[ribosome]]s that are the sites of [[protein synthesis]].

The [[phospholipid membrane]] encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the [[perinuclear space]] but separate from the [[cytosol]]. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function.  The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell.  Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes.  Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.<ref name=\"Alberts_2002\">{{cite book | last1 = Alberts | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Alexander | last3 = Lewis | first3 = Julian | last4 = Raff | first4 = Martin | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Keith | last6 = Walter | first6 = Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title = Molecular biology of the cell | date = 2002 | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8153-3218-3 | edition = 4th | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26841/ | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171003052046/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26841/ | archive-date = 2017-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Geoffrey M.|name-list-format=vanc|title=The cell: a molecular approach|date=2000|publisher=ASM Press|location=Washington (DC)|isbn=978-0-87893-106-4|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/cell00geof|url-status=live|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Rough endoplasmic reticulum===\n[[File:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px|A 2-minute animation showing how a protein destined for the [[secretory pathway]] is synthesized into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which appears at the upper right approximately halfway through the animation.]]\nThe surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated '''RER''' or Rough ER) (also called ''granular endoplasmic reticulum'') is studded with protein-manufacturing [[ribosome]]s giving it a \"rough\" appearance (hence its name).<ref>{{cite web|title=reticulum|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/reticulum|website=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the [[translocon]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = G\u00f6rlich D, Prehn S, Hartmann E, Kalies KU, Rapoport TA | title = A mammalian homolog of SEC61p and SECYp is associated with ribosomes and nascent polypeptides during translocation | journal = Cell | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 489\u2013503 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1423609 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90517-G }}</ref> However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane.

Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a [[signal peptide|signal sequence]]. The N-terminus (one end) of a [[polypeptide]] chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few [[amino acid]]s that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the [[translocon]], a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s and moved along the [[cytoskeleton]] toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Soltys BJ, Gupta RS | title = Interrelationships of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, intermediate filaments, and microtubules--a quadruple fluorescence labeling study | journal = Biochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 70 | issue = 10\u201311 | pages = 1174\u201386 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1363623 | doi = 10.1139/o92-163 }}</ref>\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention [[Structural motif|motif]].

The [[Dartford Crossing]] (A282) is part of the orbital route but is not part of the motorway. The M25 is one of the most important roads in Britain and one of the busiest. The final section was opened by the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986; on opening it was the longest [[ring road]] in Europe at {{convert|117|mi}}.\n\n[[Patrick Abercrombie]] had proposed an orbital motorway around London in the 1944 ''[[Greater London Plan]]'', which evolved into the [[London Ringways]] project in the early 1960s. By 1966, planning had started on two projects, [[Ringway 3]] to the north and [[Ringway 4]] to the south. By the time the first sections opened in 1975, it was decided the ringways would be combined into a single orbital motorway. The M25 was one of the first motorway projects to consider environmental concerns and almost 40 public inquiries took place. The road was built as planned despite some protest that included the section over the [[North Downs]] and around [[Epping Forest]] which required an extension of the [[Bell Common Tunnel]].\n\nAlthough the M25 was popular during construction, it quickly became apparent that there was insufficient traffic capacity.

Following the war, 11 separate [[county council]]s told the [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]] that an orbital route was \"first priority\" for London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nPlans stalled because the route was planned to pass through several urban areas, which attracted criticism. The original D Ring through north-west London was intended to be a simple upgrade of streets. In 1951, Middlesex County Council planned a route for the orbital road through the county, passing through [[Eastcote]] and west of [[Bushey]], connecting with the proposed [[M1 motorway]], but it was rejected by the Ministry two years later. An alternative route via [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and [[Ealing]] was proposed, but this was abandoned after the council revealed the extent of property demolition required.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nIn 1964, the [[London County Council]] announced the [[London Ringways]] plan, to consist of four concentric motorway rings around London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=43,112}} The following year, the transport minister [[Barbara Castle]] announced that the D Ring would be essential to build. The component parts of what became the M25 came from [[Ringway 3]] / [[M16 motorway]] in the north and [[Ringway 4]] in the south.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nThe Ringways plan was controversial owing to the destruction required for the inner two ring roads, ([[Ringway 1]] and [[Ringway 2]]). Parts of Ringway 1 were constructed (including the [[West Cross Route]]), despite stiff opposition, before the overall plan was postponed in February 1972. In April 1973, the [[Greater London Council]] elections resulted in a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] victory; the party then formally announced the cancellation of the Ringways running inside Greater London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=103}} This did not affect the routes that would become the M25, because they were planned as central government projects from the outset.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=111}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:M25 - Work In Progress at Tatling End - geograph.org.uk - 37213.jpg|thumb|View north from Higher [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]] Fire Station at Tatling End on the A40 in July 1984, with the [[Chiltern Main Line]] five-arch 1906 [[Chalfont Viaduct]], originally built to straddle the [[River Misbourne]] ]]\nThere was no individual [[public inquiry]] into the M25 as a whole.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=116}} Each section was presented to planning authorities in its own right and was individually justified, with 39 separate public inquiries relating to sections of the route.

The [[Dartford Crossing]] (A282) is part of the orbital route but is not part of the motorway. The M25 is one of the most important roads in Britain and one of the busiest. The final section was opened by the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986; on opening it was the longest [[ring road]] in Europe at {{convert|117|mi}}.\n\n[[Patrick Abercrombie]] had proposed an orbital motorway around London in the 1944 ''[[Greater London Plan]]'', which evolved into the [[London Ringways]] project in the early 1960s. By 1966, planning had started on two projects, [[Ringway 3]] to the north and [[Ringway 4]] to the south. By the time the first sections opened in 1975, it was decided the ringways would be combined into a single orbital motorway. The M25 was one of the first motorway projects to consider environmental concerns and almost 40 public inquiries took place. The road was built as planned despite some protest that included the section over the [[North Downs]] and around [[Epping Forest]] which required an extension of the [[Bell Common Tunnel]].\n\nAlthough the M25 was popular during construction, it quickly became apparent that there was insufficient traffic capacity. Because of the public inquiries, several junctions merely served local roads where office and retail developments were built, attracting even more traffic onto the M25 than it was designed for. The congestion has led to traffic management schemes that include [[variable speed limit]] and [[smart motorway]]. Since opening, the M25 has been progressively widened, particularly near [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\n==Description==\n===Route===\n[[File:M23-M25 Intersection - geograph.org.uk - 15455.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stack interchange#four-level stack|Four-level stack]] where the M25 meets the [[M23 motorway|M23]]]]\nThe M25 almost completely encircles [[Greater London]] and passes briefly through it to the east.

Following the war, 11 separate [[county council]]s told the [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]] that an orbital route was \"first priority\" for London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nPlans stalled because the route was planned to pass through several urban areas, which attracted criticism. The original D Ring through north-west London was intended to be a simple upgrade of streets. In 1951, Middlesex County Council planned a route for the orbital road through the county, passing through [[Eastcote]] and west of [[Bushey]], connecting with the proposed [[M1 motorway]], but it was rejected by the Ministry two years later. An alternative route via [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and [[Ealing]] was proposed, but this was abandoned after the council revealed the extent of property demolition required.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nIn 1964, the [[London County Council]] announced the [[London Ringways]] plan, to consist of four concentric motorway rings around London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=43,112}} The following year, the transport minister [[Barbara Castle]] announced that the D Ring would be essential to build. The component parts of what became the M25 came from [[Ringway 3]] / [[M16 motorway]] in the north and [[Ringway 4]] in the south.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nThe Ringways plan was controversial owing to the destruction required for the inner two ring roads, ([[Ringway 1]] and [[Ringway 2]]). Parts of Ringway 1 were constructed (including the [[West Cross Route]]), despite stiff opposition, before the overall plan was postponed in February 1972. In April 1973, the [[Greater London Council]] elections resulted in a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] victory; the party then formally announced the cancellation of the Ringways running inside Greater London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=103}} This did not affect the routes that would become the M25, because they were planned as central government projects from the outset.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=111}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:M25 - Work In Progress at Tatling End - geograph.org.uk - 37213.jpg|thumb|View north from Higher [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]] Fire Station at Tatling End on the A40 in July 1984, with the [[Chiltern Main Line]] five-arch 1906 [[Chalfont Viaduct]], originally built to straddle the [[River Misbourne]] ]]\nThere was no individual [[public inquiry]] into the M25 as a whole.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=116}} Each section was presented to planning authorities in its own right and was individually justified, with 39 separate public inquiries relating to sections of the route. The need for the ministry to negotiate with local councils meant that more junctions with local traffic were built than originally proposed.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=117}} A report in 1981 showed that the M25 had the potential to attract office and retail development along its route, negating the proposed traffic improvements and making Central London a less desirable place to work.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=118}} None of the motorway was prevented from being built by objections at the public inquiries.{{sfn|Hamilton|2015|p=11}} However, as a consequence of the backlash against the Ringways, and criticism at the public inquiries, the motorway was built with environmental concerns in mind.

It was originally proposed as an all-purpose route, but was upgraded to motorway standard in 1966. It was the first section of the route announced as M25 from the beginning.
