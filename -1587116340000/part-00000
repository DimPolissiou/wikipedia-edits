Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was armed with the T139 90&nbsp;mm main gun with a cylindrical blast deflector on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M47's M36 90&nbsp;mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor.

To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 pilots #1 and 2 tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nThe last major US upgrade of the M48 tank series was the M48A5. This upgrade was applied to M48A2s and A3s still in service with Army National Guard units in order to maintain the training levels of Guard units as well as using a commonality in ammunition amongst tanks. The upgrade featured the mounting of the [[Royal Ordnance L7|M68 105mm gun]] carried in the M116 mount and the all-metric measurement M16 fire control system. The hull was upgraded with components from the [[M60 Tank|M60A1 RISE]] Hull PIP Update Kit and incorporated as many of the components as possible. Some of these included the retrofit of the AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine incorporating TLAC engine panels coupled to with a CD-850-6 cross-drive transmission, a 300 gallon fuel capacity and the T142 track assembly, M13A1 NBC protection system for the crew and the replacement of the .30 caliber M37 coaxial machine gun with the .50 caliber [[M73 machine gun|M219]]/T175 machine gun.<ref>Rolf Hilmes, Main Battle Tanks: Developments in Design since 1945 (McLean, Va.: Pergamon-Brassey\u2019s International Defense Publishers, 1987), p. 11-18; Zaloga and Loop, Modern American Armor</ref> Because all M48A5 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A5 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles. In addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\nThe conversion program ran from October 1975 to December 1979 with a total of 2,069 M48A3s converted to the A5 standard.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service. Many other countries, however, continued to use these M48 models.\n\n==Combat service==\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:Vietnam....Marines riding atop an M-48 tank cover their ears as te 90mm gun fires during a road sweep southwest of... - NARA - 532483.tif|thumb|US Marines riding atop an M48 tank in Vietnam in April 1968.]]\nThe M48 saw extensive action with the US military during the Vietnam War.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role.

One was between the US 1-69th Armor and PT-76 light amphibious tanks of the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment at [[Ben Het Camp]] in March 1969.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971.

However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor.

Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was armed with the T139 90&nbsp;mm main gun with a cylindrical blast deflector on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M47's M36 90&nbsp;mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated to the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at [[Fort Knox]] to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A1===\n[[File:Tensions_ran_high_at_Checkpoint_Charlie_in_1961_as_Easterners_fled_to_West,_Berlin_Wall_went_up.jpg|thumb|right|Two M48A1 face off against T-54's during one of several standoffs at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961]]\nThe Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42{{r|1952_Baldwin}} had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A/B versions.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=32|q=The M48s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.}} The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle's operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 pilots #1 and 2 tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The gasoline engine managed only {{convert|0.33|mpgus|km/L|abbr=on}}, limiting range to {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} miles. The M48's width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=70{{ndash}}72}} Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nThe last major US upgrade of the M48 tank series was the M48A5. This upgrade was applied to M48A2s and A3s still in service with Army National Guard units in order to maintain the training levels of Guard units as well as using a commonality in ammunition amongst tanks. The upgrade featured the mounting of the [[Royal Ordnance L7|M68 105mm gun]] carried in the M116 mount and the all-metric measurement M16 fire control system. The hull was upgraded with components from the [[M60 Tank|M60A1 RISE]] Hull PIP Update Kit and incorporated as many of the components as possible. Some of these included the retrofit of the AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine incorporating TLAC engine panels coupled to with a CD-850-6 cross-drive transmission, a 300 gallon fuel capacity and the T142 track assembly, M13A1 NBC protection system for the crew and the replacement of the .30 caliber M37 coaxial machine gun with the .50 caliber [[M73 machine gun|M219]]/T175 machine gun.<ref>Rolf Hilmes, Main Battle Tanks: Developments in Design since 1945 (McLean, Va.: Pergamon-Brassey\u2019s International Defense Publishers, 1987), p. 11-18; Zaloga and Loop, Modern American Armor</ref> Because all M48A5 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A5 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles. The conversion program ran from October 1975 to December 1979 with a total of 2,069 M48A3s converted to the A5 standard.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role. However, there were few actual tank versus tank battles. One was between the US 1-69th Armor and PT-76 light amphibious tanks of the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment at [[Ben Het Camp]] in March 1969.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971.

In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor.

The [[Turkish Armed Forces in Northern Cyprus]] continue to use M48 tanks today.\n\nWhen the [[Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict (1978\u2013present)|Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict]] began, the Turkish Armed Forces had a number of M48s. These were used throughout the 1980s and the 1990s as static artillery and was used in defending military-base perimeters from enemy attacks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIranian M48 tanks were used widely in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] from 1980 to 1988, where they faced Iraqi T-55s, T-62s and T-72s, alongside M60 Pattons, in fierce and harsh combat with their Iraqi foes, with mixed results. M48s of the 37th Armored Brigade were used in the [[Battle of Abadan]]. About 150 of M48s were lost in this tank battle alone.{{r|2011_Farrokh|page=362}}\n\n===Africa===\nIn 1973, Morocco took delivery of its first M48A3s. By the end of the 1970s, further deliveries of M48A5 had occurred and the upgrade to M48A5 was achieved locally with the aid of US consultants. In 1987, a final shipment of 100 M48A5 tanks from the Wisconsin National Guard was delivered to the Moroccan army. There are unconfirmed reports of deliveries of Israeli M48A5s during the 1980s. The tanks were used in the Western Sahara desert against Polisario guerrillas.\n\nPakistan used M48 Pattons while reinforcing American troops during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993.{{r|1999_Bowden|page=324}}\n\n==Variants==\n===U.S.===\n[[File:M48A5.png|thumb|M48A5 Patton with an M48A3 commander's cupola.]]\n* '''M48''': Differed from the M47 in having yet another new turret design and a redesigned hull, doing away with the bow machine gun position, featuring the M41 90&nbsp;mm gun.

The team currently competes in the [[Scottish Championship]], the second tier of the [[Scottish Professional Football League]], and hosts home games at [[Caledonian Stadium]].\n\nInverness Caledonian Thistle won the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[2015 Scottish Cup Final|2015]] and was runner-up in the [[Scottish League Cup]] [[2014 Scottish League Cup Final|a year earlier]]. They have also won the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] twice and the [[Scottish Football League First Division]] twice.

Alan Hercher scored Caledonian Thistle's first league goal, and went on to complete a hat-trick. The club eventually finished sixth in the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], and followed this up with a third place finish in 1995-96. Before the start of the 1996-97 season the club changed its name to '''Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.''' Part of the application to join the Scottish League was a commitment to move to a new stadium and, a year later than originally planned, Caley moved to the newly built Caledonian Park in November 1996. With a new name and new stadium, the club finished [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1996-97]] as Third Division champions, earning promotion to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. The club spent two seasons in the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]].

In the first leg, at home, they fell to an unfortunate 1\u20130 loss while down to 10 men after [[Liam Polworth]] was handed a straight red for an apparent high foot on [[Mark Connolly]] while making a clearance. Inverness went to [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] with heads held high hoping to overturn the 1\u20130 deficit, but hope began to fade after [[Dundee United F.C.|United]] were awarded and scored a controversial penalty just before half time. The penalty was conceded by a [[Brad McKay]] handball, after it deflected off his heel. Again, controversy followed just after half time, when a handball wasn't seen by the referee which resulted in [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1964)|John Robertson]] being sent to the stands for flicking a water-bottle in aggravation near the [[Assistant referee (association football)|4th official]]. Inverness went on to lose 3\u20130, 4\u20130 on aggregate. After the match, Robertson stated in an interview with the [[BBC Sport|BBC]] on what punishments he'd receive from the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] for his actions;<blockquote>\"I don't care. They [the SFA] can ban me for as long as they want. I'm going to start speaking out now because I've had enough of it.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48318342|title=Dundee Utd 3\u20130 Inverness CT: Officials a disgrace \u2013 John Robertson|date=2019-05-17|access-date=2019-05-19|language=en-GB}}</ref></blockquote><br />\n\nJuly 2019 saw the beginning of the 25th Anniversary Celebrations: a new 3rd Kit was announced as well as a special friendly game. The [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] campaign was poor; an 11\u201310 loss on penalties to [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] was followed up by wins over [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] and [[Cove Rangers F.C.|Cove Rangers]] but for the 3rd year on the trot the club failed to progress to the next round. The league, like the League Cup, started off disappointingly, with to a 4\u20131 defeat by [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] at [[Tannadice Park]]. However, the following weekend they won 2\u20131 at home against [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]]. The game came one year after the death of the club's first captain, Alan Hercher, who scored a hat-trick against the same opposition in the first (home) game of the club's existence, almost 25 years prior. This game saw the debut of the anniversary kit. \n\nBy the end of February, the club was close to securing a second place finish, and potentially even winning title ahead of Dundee United, who were dropping crucial points. However, in a situation that had not been seen since the Second World War, the league was postponed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] with the SPFL choosing to shut down all football in Scotland from the Premiership to local leagues. A decision was made to finish the season as it stood and to do away with the play-offs. This was met with controversy, as Inverness, [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] planned on voting no, however, Dundee changed their vote at the last minute, leading to the league standings being finalised. Had Dundee also voted no, the SPFL Proposition would have failed and the playoffs would have taken place. Following this outcome, a league reconstruction proposal has been made, which could see Inverness go up with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] to form a 14 team [[Scottish Premiership]], resulting in Partick being spared relegation into League One.\n\n== Kit history ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nList of manufacturers and sponsors<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle/Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle.htm|title=Inverness Caledonian Thistle \u2013 Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref>\n!Season\n!Manufacturer\n!Shirt Sponsor\n|-\n|1994\u20131995\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|England}} Matchwinner\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Scottish Citylink]]\n|-\n|1996\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Xerox]]{{not in source|date=November 2019}}\n|-\n|1996\u20131998\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|France}} [[Le Coq Sportif]]\n|{{Flagicon|SCO}} [[Scottish Citylink]]\n|-\n|1998\u20131999\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[ScotRail (National Express)|ScotRail]]\n|-\n|1999\u20132001\n| rowspan=\"7\" |{{Flagicon|Italy}} [[Erre\u00e0]]\n|-\n|2001\u20132003\n|{{Flagicon|Japan}} [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]\n|-\n|2003\u20132004\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} Inverness Medical\n|-\n|2004\u20132007\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} One Touch\n|-\n|2007\u20132010\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Flybe]]\n|-\n|2010\u20132014\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Orion Group (recruitment company)|Orion Group]]\n|-\n|2014\u20132015\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]\n|-\n|2015\u20132016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|England}} [[Carbrini Sportswear|Carbrini]] \n|-\n|2016\u20132017\n| rowspan=\"3\" |{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[McEwan Fraser Legal]]\n|-\n|2017\u2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|Italy}} [[Erre\u00e0]]\n|}\nIn 2017 Inverness cut ties with Carbrini due to delays in manufacturing of replica kits, which angered many fans who had ordered their kits and took months to arrive at their homes. The kits were only available at [[JD Sports]] Stores, and did not become available to buy until a month into the [[2016\u201317 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season|2016\u201317]] season. Inverness partnered up with longtime supplier Errea in May 2017 in time for the [[2017\u201318 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season|2017\u201318]] season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ictfc.com/news/club-news/1894-ictfc-forge-new-relationship-with-errea|title=ICTFC Forge New Relationship with Old Friends at Errea \u2013 Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC|website=ictfc.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110175017/http://ictfc.com/news/club-news/1894-ictfc-forge-new-relationship-with-errea|archive-date=10 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019 a 3rd Kit, which was given a limited release of less than 300, was launched. The kit featured 4 vertical stripes of red, black, white and blue, a silver crest, and the names of all the players who were with the team in the [[1994\u201395 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season|1994\u201395]] season, as well as featuring the anniversary logo used to promote the occasion and a one-off 25th anniversary sponsor.\n\n== Rivalries ==\n=== Aberdeen ===\nA big derby fixture is the [[North derby]] between Inverness and Aberdeen, which is still regarded as a derby even though the clubs are over 100 miles apart. The rivalry started when Inverness were ground sharing with Aberdeen at [[Pittodrie Stadium]] in 2004 when Inverness first gained promotion to the top flight, and their ground was being improved to the standards required to be a [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] team. \n\nBy far the biggest game between the two was the [[2014 Scottish League Cup Final]] at [[Celtic Park]], where Inverness held Aberdeen to a 0\u20130 draw, but ultimately lost 4\u20132 on penalties.\n\nAberdeen are the dominant team in the derby with 24 wins to 10.\n\nInverness has been considered as somewhat of a breeding ground for future Aberdeen players, as players such as [[Adam Rooney]], [[Jonny Hayes]], [[Miles Storey]], [[Graeme Shinnie]], [[Greg Tansey]] and [[Ryan Christie]] have all ended up at Aberdeen after their time in Inverness.\n\n=== Clachnacuddin ===\nInverness also has a long-lasting rivalry with [[Clachnacuddin F.C.|Clachnacuddin]], which goes back to before [[Caledonian F.C.|Caledonian]] and [[Inverness Thistle F.C.|Inverness Thistle]] merged. All three teams were founding members of the [[Highland Football League|Highland League]], and all their grounds were close together in Inverness. This led to the City Derby. Though this rivalry is on a lesser scale than it was before the election of Inverness to the SFL, it still exists through pre-season friendlies. Inverness has 17 wins in this fixture, and Clach only two.\n\n=== Ross County ===\nInverness have had a long-standing rivalry with local club [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], who are situated a few miles north of Inverness in [[Dingwall]]. The rivalry began when both teams were elected to the SFL in the [[1994\u201395 Scottish Football League|1994\u201395 Season]]. They contest the [[Highland derby]]. Inverness are the dominant team within the derby with 22 wins to County's 16.\n\n== Stadium ==\n[[Highland (council area)|The Highland Council]] contributed \u00a3900,000 towards the development of [[Caledonian Stadium]], now known for sponsorship reasons as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. The stadium is situated beside the [[Moray Firth]], in the shadow of the [[Kessock Bridge]]. Its construction was promised in their election to the Scottish Football League. The former ground of Caledonian, [[Telford Street Park|Telford Street]], was used until the new stadium was complete. The stadium has 4 stands \u2013 The North Stand, The Jock McDonald Main Stand, The South Stand, and the small West Stand. Away supporters are housed in the South Stand, which can hold around 2200 supporters, as well as being given the West Stand and uncovered section of the Main Stand if demand is exceeded, however, if demand is not met, away supporters may be given the uncovered section in the Main Stand. The North and South stands were constructed in 2005 in order to meet SPL requirements. The West Stand was constructed in 2007, holding around 400. It was intended to be used as a singing section, however, the stand remains unused on most match days.\n\nIn 2019, the stadium was gifted back to the club, and its original name of the '''Caledonian Stadium''' returned.\n\n=== Attendance ===\n[[File:Caledonian stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Tulloch Caledonian Stadium]]\nThe club's highest 'home' (league) attendance actually occurred while they were groundsharing with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]]. With Inverness fans in the traditional home end, and Aberdeen fans filling the away end, a record attendance of 9,530 was set on 16 October 2004. This record may stand for some time, as the crowd that day was bigger than the current capacity of [[Caledonian Stadium]].\n\nThe club's highest cup attendance was also recorded in a venue other than their home ground. A crowd of 11,296 watched Inverness play [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 9 March 1996 at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] in [[Dundee]]. The game had been switched to [[Dundee]] as the club's home ground ([[Telford Street Park]] at that time) was deemed unsuitable for the [[Scottish Cup]] quarter-final tie.\n\nThe highest attendance recorded at the [[Caledonian Stadium]] is 7,753 set on 20 January 2008 against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|13 February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ictfc.com/team/inverness-caledonian-thistle |title=2019\u201320 Inverness Caledonian Thistle squad |website=Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC |accessdate=31 July 2019 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{Fs start|no=|nat=|name=|pos=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=1 |nat=SCO|name=[[Mark Ridgers]]|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=2 |nat=SCO|name=[[Shaun Rooney]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=3 |nat=ENG|name=[[Carl Tremarco]]|pos=DF||other=[[captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=4 |nat=SCO|name=[[Sean Welsh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5 |nat=SCO|name=[[Lewis Toshney]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7 |nat=SCO|name=[[James Keatings]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=8 |nat=ENG|name=[[David Carson (footballer)|David Carson]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=9 |nat=SCO|name=[[Jordan White (footballer)|Jordan White]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=IRE|name=[[Aaron Doran]]|pos=MF||other=[[captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=SCO|name=[[Tom Walsh (footballer)|Tom Walsh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=SCO|name=[[Kevin McHattie]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=ENG|name=[[James Vincent (footballer)|James Vincent]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs mid|no=|nat=|name=|pos=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=ENG|name=[[Miles Storey]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=BUL|name=[[Nikolay Todorov (footballer, born 1996)|Nikolay Todorov]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=SCO|name=[[Cameron Mackay|Cammy Mackay]]|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=SCO|name=[[Brad McKay]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=CAN|name=[[Charlie Trafford]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=SCO|name=[[Cameron Harper]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=BRA|name=[[Matheus Machado]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=SCO|name=[[Roddy MacGregor]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=31|nat=SCO|name=Martin Mackinnon|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat=SCO|name=Shane Harkness|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=42|nat=SCO|name=Kane Davies|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs end|no=|nat=|name=|pos=|other=}}\n\n===On loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=SCO|name=[[Daniel MacKay]]|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Elgin City F.C.|Elgin City]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=SCO|name=Daniel Hoban|pos=GK|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=SCO|name=Ryan Fyffe|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat=SCO|name=Harry Nicolson|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=33|nat=SCO|name=Donald Morrison|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=34|nat=SCO|name=Gabriel Hastings|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=35|nat=SCO|name=[[Jack Brown (footballer, born 2001)|Jack Brown]]|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=36|nat=SCO|name=Lewis Hyde|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=38|nat=SCO|name=Ross Gunn|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=39|nat=SCO|name=Roddy Kennedy|pos=FW|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n=== Notable players ===\n{{details|List of Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. players}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Club staff ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He remained in charge for only one season, leaving in 1995 to be closer to his family in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. Baltacha was replaced by [[Huntly F.C.|Huntly]] manager [[Steve Paterson]], who to date is the club's longest-serving manager. During his seven and a half years as manager, from the summer of 1995 to December 2002, Paterson succeeded in taking the club to the [[Scottish Football League]] [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]]. He also steered ICT to their famous 3\u20131 Scottish Cup victory against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 2000. In November 2002, Paterson was strongly linked to the vacant manager's position at [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. However, he chose to stay with Inverness for another month, after which he left, along with assistant [[Duncan Shearer]], to become manager of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].\n\nThe club also had a [[Director of football]], with former player [[Graeme Bennett]] appointed while Steve Paterson was manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ictfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Chairmen|publisher=Inverness Caledonian Thistle website|title=BOARD OF DIRECTORS|date=25 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Paterson was replaced by former [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] player [[John Robertson (footballer born 1964)|John Robertson]], whose two-year reign as manager was an exceptionally successful period. Under Robertson, Inverness won the [[2003\u201304 Scottish Challenge Cup|2003\u201304]] [[Scottish Challenge Cup]], gained another Scottish Cup victory over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], this time 1\u20130 thanks to a goal on the stroke of half time by club record scorer [[Dennis Wyness]] and won the [[2003\u201304 Scottish First Division|First Division Championship]], taking the club into the SPL. Robertson eventually left to become Hearts manager and was replaced by [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline's]] [[Craig Brewster]] as player-manager. Brewster succeeded in keeping the club in the SPL. He also introduced new training regimes to increase player fitness and was successful in steering the club to good results against a number of established Premier League sides, including Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, Hearts and Hibs.  After a period of just over thirteen months at the club he left to become the new [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] manager after the sacking of [[Gordon Chisholm]].\n\nFormer player [[Charlie Christie]] was appointed manager on 27 January 2006, after a successful spell as caretaker manager following the departure of Brewster, during which time Inverness achieved three wins out of three games played, including a record victory for the club in the SPL as they beat [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] 4\u20131 away from home.  He resigned on 19 August 2007 due to the pressures of the job, and because he believed it to be the correct decision for him and his family.<ref name=\"Charlie Christie Resigns\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/6954546.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Christie quits as Inverness boss|date=24 August 2009}}</ref>   He has now resumed his former role, running the club's Centenary Club lottery. A short time after Christie resigned, Craig Brewster was reappointed. This was a controversial decision by the club, as Brewster had left to manage Dundee United only 18 months previously.

The club needed a win from [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] over [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], to secure play-offs, which unfortunately did not come as Dundee succumbed to a 4<span class=\"\" data-ve-attributes=\"{\"typeof\":\"mw:Entity\"}\">\u2013</span>0 defeat.<ref name=\"2017 relegation\"/>\n\nA few weeks after the sacking of Foran, former manager [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1964)|John Robertson]], who brought the club into the Premiership for the first time in their history in 2004, returned to manage the club in a bid to get them back to top flight. Doing this, he became the second former manager to return to managing the club, after Craig Brewster left in 2006 and came back for a second spell in 2007. Robertson's attempt to return to the top flight immediately was halted by [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] after a late goal stopped any chances of Inverness making the play-offs, and took the season, like the previous year, to the last day, where [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] were playing [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]], and Inverness were away to [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. To secure a play-off spot, Dunfermline had to lose and Inverness had to win. Inverness did their part with a 3\u20130 win, but [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] lost 4\u20130 after going down to 10 men against ''the Pars''.\n\nThe following season did not start out successful, with 9 draws in their first 12 games, which also included failing to defend the Challenge Cup title after being defeated 2\u20131 by Dunfermline. However results soon picked up and by May, Inverness captured a play-off spot; they also enjoyed a strong cup run with a 6\u20131 win over Edinburgh City, a 4\u20130 win over East Kilbride, a 5\u20134 penalty win over Ross County and a 2\u20131 win over Dundee United before heading to Hampden where they were beaten 3\u20130 by Hearts in the semi-final. The play-offs started well, however after beating Ayr United 4\u20132 on aggregate hopes were shattered with a controversial 4\u20130 loss to Dundee United in the semi-final.\n\n== Mascots ==\nIn recent years, the club have embraced the trend of adopting an official mascot. These have included:\n\n* ''ICaT'' \u2013 a play on the initials 'ICT', ICaT was designed from the winning drawing in a competition amongst Inverness school children.\n* ''SuperSub'' \u2013 a [[Submarine sandwich]] in a Superhero costume was retired after [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] cancelled their sponsorship.\n* ''Nessie'' \u2013 a 'Nessie' costume wearing the club's home kit.

Alan Hercher scored Caledonian Thistle's first league goal, and went on to complete a hat-trick. The club eventually finished sixth in the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], and followed this up with a third place finish in 1995-96. Before the start of the 1996-97 season the club changed its name to '''Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.''' Part of the application to join the Scottish League was a commitment to move to a new stadium and, a year later than originally planned, Caley moved to the newly built Caledonian Park in November 1996. With a new name and new stadium, the club finished [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1996-97]] as Third Division champions, earning promotion to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. The club spent two seasons in the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After a closely fought campaign, they finished runners-up to [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] in [[1998\u201399 in Scottish football|Season 1998\u201399]], securing promotion to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]].\n\n=== First Division (1999\u20132004) ===\nThe club first came to national prominence after their [[Scottish Cup]] victories over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 2000 and 2003: winning 3\u20131 at [[Celtic Park]],<ref name=\"3-1 Celtic\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/636000.stm|title=Caley's minnows slay Celtic|date=8 February 2000|publisher=BBC Sport website}}</ref> resulting in the headline \"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious#Other references|Super Caley Go Ballistic Celtic Are Atrocious]]\" in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)#Popularity|The Sun]]'' which is now framed in the foyer of Caledonian Stadium,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20021020/ai_n12579086|title=A Second Chance to Go Ballistic|last=Grant|first=Michael|date=2002-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306044934/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20021020/ai_n12579086|archive-date=2008-03-06|url-status=dead|publisher=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]]}}</ref> and 1\u20130.<ref name=\"1-0 Celtic\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/2871857.stm|title=Super Caley do it again|date=23 March 2003|publisher=BBC Sport website}}</ref> Inverness also knocked other SPL teams out of cup competitions, including [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]]<ref name=\"1-0 Well\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/3532159.stm|title=Motherwell 0\u20131 Inverness CT|date=6 March 2004|publisher=BBC Sport website}}</ref> and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].<ref name=\"3-1 Hearts\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scottish_cup/1780004.stm|title=Super Caley shock Hearts|date=26 January 2002|publisher=BBC Sport website}}</ref> Over the first ten years of their existence the club had been responsible for a total of 12 'shocks' and as a result had gained themselves a reputation as being \"[[Underdog (competition)|giant killers]]\".

This made the club eligible for promotion to the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL). However, SPL rules at that time stated that all member clubs must have a stadium with a minimum capacity of 10,000 seats. Caledonian Stadium did not meet this criterion, leaving the club's Board with a dilemma: either to remain in the First Division (like [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] the previous season) or to groundshare with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], over 100 miles (160&nbsp;km) away. After consulting with supporters, the Board decided the 'sacrifice' of one season in [[Aberdeen]] would be an acceptable compromise to ensure Premier League participation for the club.\n\n=== Scottish Premier League (2004\u20132009) ===\n[[File:Caledonian Stadium - geograph-916623.jpg|thumb|right|Inverness playing [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] in May 2008 at the Caledonian Stadium.]]\n\nA change in SPL rules during the [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305 season]] reduced the stadium seating requirement to 6,000 seats for SPL membership.

Robertson became the first manager in the cup's history to lift the trophy twice with the same club.\n\nThis cup win kick-started an unbeaten run of 13 games as Inverness went from lingering around the lower echelons of the table to mid-table. However, despite a late push, an injury-time equaliser in the final home game of the season against [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]] meant ICT narrowly missed out on the promotion play-offs by just two points, finishing in 5th place despite winning 3\u20130 away to [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]] on the final day, which would've confirmed a play-off slot had Dunfermlne either drawn or lost to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. \n\nIn August 2018, the club was saddened to learn of the death of ex-player Alan Hercher at 52 years of age. He was the club's first captain, goalscorer and hat-trick scorer \u2013 in their first league game against [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]]. In tribute, a minute's silence was held at Inverness' first home game of the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Championship]] season against [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] which ended in a 0\u20130 draw. \n\nCome the new year, Inverness were doing better than they had the previous season, sitting in the play-off spots despite drawing nearly every game.  The club beat rivals [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] to progress into the quarter-finals of the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] before making the semi-final after a last gasp winner from [[Aaron Doran]] against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].

They played [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]], but were unable to proceed to the final, as they were defeated 3\u20130.\n\nBy the end of the season, Inverness had secured a play-off spot, after leapfrogging [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] into 3rd place. In the quarter-finals, Inverness defeated [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr]], winning 3\u20131 in the first leg, and drawing 1\u20131 in the second, securing a comfortable 4\u20132 aggregate win. However, the joy was short-lived after facing [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the semi-finals. In the first leg, at home, they fell to an unfortunate 1\u20130 loss while down to 10 men after [[Liam Polworth]] was handed a straight red for an apparent high foot on [[Mark Connolly]] while making a clearance. Inverness went to [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] with heads held high hoping to overturn the 1\u20130 deficit, but hope began to fade after [[Dundee United F.C.|United]] were awarded and scored a controversial penalty just before half time. The penalty was conceded by a [[Brad McKay]] handball, after it deflected off his heel. Again, controversy followed just after half time, when a handball wasn't seen by the referee which resulted in [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1964)|John Robertson]] being sent to the stands for flicking a water-bottle in aggravation near the [[Assistant referee (association football)|4th official]]. Inverness went on to lose 3\u20130, 4\u20130 on aggregate. After the match, Robertson stated in an interview with the [[BBC Sport|BBC]] on what punishments he'd receive from the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] for his actions;<blockquote>\"I don't care.

The [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] campaign was poor; an 11\u201310 loss on penalties to [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] was followed up by wins over [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] and [[Cove Rangers F.C.|Cove Rangers]] but for the 3rd year on the trot the club failed to progress to the next round. The league, like the League Cup, started off disappointingly, with to a 4\u20131 defeat by [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] at [[Tannadice Park]]. However, the following weekend they won 2\u20131 at home against [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]]. The game came one year after the death of the club's first captain, Alan Hercher, who scored a hat-trick against the same opposition in the first (home) game of the club's existence, almost 25 years prior. This game saw the debut of the anniversary kit. \n\nBy the end of February, the club was close to securing a second place finish, and potentially even winning title ahead of Dundee United, who were dropping crucial points. However, in a situation that had not been seen since the Second World War, the league was postponed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] with the SPFL choosing to shut down all football in Scotland from the Premiership to local leagues. A decision was made to finish the season as it stood and to do away with the play-offs. This was met with controversy, as Inverness, [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick]] and [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] planned on voting no, however, Dundee changed their vote at the last minute, leading to the league standings being finalised. Had Dundee also voted no, the SPFL Proposition would have failed and the playoffs would have taken place. Following this outcome, a league reconstruction proposal has been made, which could see Inverness go up with [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] to form a 14 team [[Scottish Premiership]], resulting in Partick being spared relegation into League One.\n\n== Kit history ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nList of manufacturers and sponsors<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle/Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle.htm|title=Inverness Caledonian Thistle \u2013 Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref>\n!Season\n!Manufacturer\n!Shirt Sponsor\n|-\n|1994\u20131995\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|England}} Matchwinner\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Scottish Citylink]]\n|-\n|1996\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Xerox]]{{not in source|date=November 2019}}\n|-\n|1996\u20131998\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|France}} [[Le Coq Sportif]]\n|{{Flagicon|SCO}} [[Scottish Citylink]]\n|-\n|1998\u20131999\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[ScotRail (National Express)|ScotRail]]\n|-\n|1999\u20132001\n| rowspan=\"7\" |{{Flagicon|Italy}} [[Erre\u00e0]]\n|-\n|2001\u20132003\n|{{Flagicon|Japan}} [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]\n|-\n|2003\u20132004\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} Inverness Medical\n|-\n|2004\u20132007\n|{{Flagicon|USA}} One Touch\n|-\n|2007\u20132010\n|{{Flagicon|England}} [[Flybe]]\n|-\n|2010\u20132014\n|{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[Orion Group (recruitment company)|Orion Group]]\n|-\n|2014\u20132015\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|USA}} [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]\n|-\n|2015\u20132016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|England}} [[Carbrini Sportswear|Carbrini]] \n|-\n|2016\u20132017\n| rowspan=\"3\" |{{Flagicon|Scotland}} [[McEwan Fraser Legal]]\n|-\n|2017\u2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{Flagicon|Italy}} [[Erre\u00e0]]\n|}\nIn 2017 Inverness cut ties with Carbrini due to delays in manufacturing of replica kits, which angered many fans who had ordered their kits and took months to arrive at their homes. The kits were only available at [[JD Sports]] Stores, and did not become available to buy until a month into the [[2016\u201317 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season|2016\u201317]] season.

The kit featured 4 vertical stripes of red, black, white and blue, a silver crest, and the names of all the players who were with the team in the [[1994\u201395 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season|1994\u201395]] season, as well as featuring the anniversary logo used to promote the occasion and a one-off 25th anniversary sponsor.\n\n== Rivalries ==\n=== Aberdeen ===\nA big derby fixture is the [[North derby]] between Inverness and Aberdeen, which is still regarded as a derby even though the clubs are over 100 miles apart. The rivalry started when Inverness were ground sharing with Aberdeen at [[Pittodrie Stadium]] in 2004 when Inverness first gained promotion to the top flight, and their ground was being improved to the standards required to be a [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] team. \n\nBy far the biggest game between the two was the [[2014 Scottish League Cup Final]] at [[Celtic Park]], where Inverness held Aberdeen to a 0\u20130 draw, but ultimately lost 4\u20132 on penalties.\n\nAberdeen are the dominant team in the derby with 24 wins to 10.\n\nInverness has been considered as somewhat of a breeding ground for future Aberdeen players, as players such as [[Adam Rooney]], [[Jonny Hayes]], [[Miles Storey]], [[Graeme Shinnie]], [[Greg Tansey]] and [[Ryan Christie]] have all ended up at Aberdeen after their time in Inverness.\n\n=== Clachnacuddin ===\nInverness also has a long-lasting rivalry with [[Clachnacuddin F.C.|Clachnacuddin]], which goes back to before [[Caledonian F.C.|Caledonian]] and [[Inverness Thistle F.C.|Inverness Thistle]] merged. All three teams were founding members of the [[Highland Football League|Highland League]], and all their grounds were close together in Inverness. This led to the City Derby. Though this rivalry is on a lesser scale than it was before the election of Inverness to the SFL, it still exists through pre-season friendlies. Inverness has 17 wins in this fixture, and Clach only two.\n\n=== Ross County ===\nInverness have had a long-standing rivalry with local club [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], who are situated a few miles north of Inverness in [[Dingwall]]. The rivalry began when both teams were elected to the SFL in the [[1994\u201395 Scottish Football League|1994\u201395 Season]]. They contest the [[Highland derby]]. Inverness are the dominant team within the derby with 22 wins to County's 16.\n\n== Stadium ==\n[[Highland (council area)|The Highland Council]] contributed \u00a3900,000 towards the development of [[Caledonian Stadium]], now known for sponsorship reasons as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. The stadium is situated beside the [[Moray Firth]], in the shadow of the [[Kessock Bridge]]. Its construction was promised in their election to the Scottish Football League. The former ground of Caledonian, [[Telford Street Park|Telford Street]], was used until the new stadium was complete. The stadium has 4 stands \u2013 The North Stand, The Jock McDonald Main Stand, The South Stand, and the small West Stand. Away supporters are housed in the South Stand, which can hold around 2200 supporters, as well as being given the West Stand and uncovered section of the Main Stand if demand is exceeded, however, if demand is not met, away supporters may be given the uncovered section in the Main Stand. The North and South stands were constructed in 2005 in order to meet SPL requirements. The West Stand was constructed in 2007, holding around 400. It was intended to be used as a singing section, however, the stand remains unused on most match days.\n\nIn 2019, the stadium was gifted back to the club, and its original name of the '''Caledonian Stadium''' returned.\n\n=== Attendance ===\n[[File:Caledonian stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Tulloch Caledonian Stadium]]\nThe club's highest 'home' (league) attendance actually occurred while they were groundsharing with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]]. With Inverness fans in the traditional home end, and Aberdeen fans filling the away end, a record attendance of 9,530 was set on 16 October 2004. This record may stand for some time, as the crowd that day was bigger than the current capacity of [[Caledonian Stadium]].\n\nThe club's highest cup attendance was also recorded in a venue other than their home ground. A crowd of 11,296 watched Inverness play [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 9 March 1996 at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] in [[Dundee]]. The game had been switched to [[Dundee]] as the club's home ground ([[Telford Street Park]] at that time) was deemed unsuitable for the [[Scottish Cup]] quarter-final tie.\n\nThe highest attendance recorded at the [[Caledonian Stadium]] is 7,753 set on 20 January 2008 against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|13 February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ictfc.com/team/inverness-caledonian-thistle |title=2019\u201320 Inverness Caledonian Thistle squad |website=Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC |accessdate=31 July 2019 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{Fs start|no=|nat=|name=|pos=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=1 |nat=SCO|name=[[Mark Ridgers]]|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=2 |nat=SCO|name=[[Shaun Rooney]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=3 |nat=ENG|name=[[Carl Tremarco]]|pos=DF||other=[[captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=4 |nat=SCO|name=[[Sean Welsh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5 |nat=SCO|name=[[Lewis Toshney]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7 |nat=SCO|name=[[James Keatings]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=8 |nat=ENG|name=[[David Carson (footballer)|David Carson]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=9 |nat=SCO|name=[[Jordan White (footballer)|Jordan White]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=IRE|name=[[Aaron Doran]]|pos=MF||other=[[captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=SCO|name=[[Tom Walsh (footballer)|Tom Walsh]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=SCO|name=[[Kevin McHattie]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=ENG|name=[[James Vincent (footballer)|James Vincent]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs mid|no=|nat=|name=|pos=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=ENG|name=[[Miles Storey]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=BUL|name=[[Nikolay Todorov (footballer, born 1996)|Nikolay Todorov]]|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=SCO|name=[[Cameron Mackay|Cammy Mackay]]|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=SCO|name=[[Brad McKay]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=CAN|name=[[Charlie Trafford]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=SCO|name=[[Cameron Harper]]|pos=DF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=BRA|name=[[Matheus Machado]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=SCO|name=[[Roddy MacGregor]]|pos=MF|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=31|nat=SCO|name=Martin Mackinnon|pos=GK|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat=SCO|name=Shane Harkness|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=42|nat=SCO|name=Kane Davies|pos=FW|other=}}\n{{Fs end|no=|nat=|name=|pos=|other=}}\n\n===On loan===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=SCO|name=[[Daniel MacKay]]|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Elgin City F.C.|Elgin City]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=SCO|name=Daniel Hoban|pos=GK|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=SCO|name=Ryan Fyffe|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=32|nat=SCO|name=Harry Nicolson|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=33|nat=SCO|name=Donald Morrison|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=34|nat=SCO|name=Gabriel Hastings|pos=DF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=35|nat=SCO|name=[[Jack Brown (footballer, born 2001)|Jack Brown]]|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=36|nat=SCO|name=Lewis Hyde|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=38|nat=SCO|name=Ross Gunn|pos=MF|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=39|nat=SCO|name=Roddy Kennedy|pos=FW|other=on loan at [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n=== Notable players ===\n{{details|List of Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. players}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Club staff ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He remained in charge for only one season, leaving in 1995 to be closer to his family in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. Baltacha was replaced by [[Huntly F.C.|Huntly]] manager [[Steve Paterson]], who to date is the club's longest-serving manager. During his seven and a half years as manager, from the summer of 1995 to December 2002, Paterson succeeded in taking the club to the [[Scottish Football League]] [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]]. He also steered ICT to their famous 3\u20131 Scottish Cup victory against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in 2000. In November 2002, Paterson was strongly linked to the vacant manager's position at [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. However, he chose to stay with Inverness for another month, after which he left, along with assistant [[Duncan Shearer]], to become manager of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].\n\nThe club also had a [[Director of football]], with former player [[Graeme Bennett]] appointed while Steve Paterson was manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ictfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Chairmen|publisher=Inverness Caledonian Thistle website|title=BOARD OF DIRECTORS|date=25 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Paterson was replaced by former [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] player [[John Robertson (footballer born 1964)|John Robertson]], whose two-year reign as manager was an exceptionally successful period. Under Robertson, Inverness won the [[2003\u201304 Scottish Challenge Cup|2003\u201304]] [[Scottish Challenge Cup]], gained another Scottish Cup victory over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], this time 1\u20130 thanks to a goal on the stroke of half time by club record scorer [[Dennis Wyness]] and won the [[2003\u201304 Scottish First Division|First Division Championship]], taking the club into the SPL. Robertson eventually left to become Hearts manager and was replaced by [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline's]] [[Craig Brewster]] as player-manager. Brewster succeeded in keeping the club in the SPL. He also introduced new training regimes to increase player fitness and was successful in steering the club to good results against a number of established Premier League sides, including Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, Hearts and Hibs.  After a period of just over thirteen months at the club he left to become the new [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] manager after the sacking of [[Gordon Chisholm]].\n\nFormer player [[Charlie Christie]] was appointed manager on 27 January 2006, after a successful spell as caretaker manager following the departure of Brewster, during which time Inverness achieved three wins out of three games played, including a record victory for the club in the SPL as they beat [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] 4\u20131 away from home.  He resigned on 19 August 2007 due to the pressures of the job, and because he believed it to be the correct decision for him and his family.<ref name=\"Charlie Christie Resigns\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/6954546.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Christie quits as Inverness boss|date=24 August 2009}}</ref>   He has now resumed his former role, running the club's Centenary Club lottery.

The club needed a win from [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] over [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], to secure play-offs, which unfortunately did not come as Dundee succumbed to a 4<span class=\"\" data-ve-attributes=\"{\"typeof\":\"mw:Entity\"}\">\u2013</span>0 defeat.<ref name=\"2017 relegation\"/>\n\nA few weeks after the sacking of Foran, former manager [[John Robertson (footballer, born 1964)|John Robertson]], who brought the club into the Premiership for the first time in their history in 2004, returned to manage the club in a bid to get them back to top flight. Doing this, he became the second former manager to return to managing the club, after Craig Brewster left in 2006 and came back for a second spell in 2007. Robertson's attempt to return to the top flight immediately was halted by [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] after a late goal stopped any chances of Inverness making the play-offs, and took the season, like the previous year, to the last day, where [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] were playing [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]], and Inverness were away to [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. To secure a play-off spot, Dunfermline had to lose and Inverness had to win. Inverness did their part with a 3\u20130 win, but [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] lost 4\u20130 after going down to 10 men against ''the Pars''.\n\nThe following season did not start out successful, with 9 draws in their first 12 games, which also included failing to defend the Challenge Cup title after being defeated 2\u20131 by Dunfermline. However results soon picked up and by May, Inverness captured a play-off spot; they also enjoyed a strong cup run with a 6\u20131 win over Edinburgh City, a 4\u20130 win over East Kilbride, a 5\u20134 penalty win over Ross County and a 2\u20131 win over Dundee United before heading to Hampden where they were beaten 3\u20130 by Hearts in the semi-final. The play-offs started well, however after beating Ayr United 4\u20132 on aggregate hopes were shattered with a controversial 4\u20130 loss to Dundee United in the semi-final.\n\n== Mascots ==\nIn recent years, the club have embraced the trend of adopting an official mascot. These have included:\n\n* ''ICaT'' \u2013 a play on the initials 'ICT', ICaT was designed from the winning drawing in a competition amongst Inverness school children.\n* ''SuperSub'' \u2013 a [[Submarine sandwich]] in a Superhero costume was retired after [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] cancelled their sponsorship.\n* ''Nessie'' \u2013 a 'Nessie' costume wearing the club's home kit. This creation has been rebranded as ''Lionel Nessi'', in reference to international footballer [[Lionel Messi]], and debuted at the [[2018 Scottish Challenge Cup Final]].\n\n== Honours ==\n\n=== League ===\n*'''[[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] (second tier):'''\n**'''Winners''' (2): '''[[2003\u201304 Scottish First Division|2003\u201304]], [[2009\u201310 Scottish First Division|2009\u201310]]\n*'''[[Scottish Football League Second Division|Scottish Second Division]] (third tier):'''\n**''Runners up (1):'' [[1998\u201399 Scottish Second Division|1998\u201399]]\n*'''[[Scottish Football League Third Division|Scottish Third Division]] (fourth tier):'''\n**'''Winners''' (1): '''[[1996\u201397 Scottish Third Division|1996\u201397]]'''\n*'''[[North Caledonian Football League|North Caledonian League]] (reserve team):'''\n**'''Winners''' (2):''' 1994\u201395, 1997\u201398\n\n=== Cup ===\n*'''[[Scottish Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners''' (1): '''[[2014\u201315 Scottish Cup|2014\u201315]]'''\n*'''[[Scottish League Cup]]:'''\n**''Runners up (1):'' [[2013\u201314 Scottish League Cup|2013\u201314]]\n*'''[[Scottish Challenge Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners''' (2): '''[[2003\u201304 Scottish Challenge Cup|2003\u201304]]''', '''[[2017\u201318 Scottish Challenge Cup|2017\u201318]]'''\n**''Runners up (2):'' [[1999\u20132000 Scottish Challenge Cup|1999\u201300]], [[2009\u201310 Scottish Challenge Cup|2009\u201310]]\n*'''[[Inverness Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners''' (7):''' 1995\u201396, 1997\u201398, 1998\u201399, 1999\u201300, 2001\u201302, 2004\u201305, 2009\u201310\n*'''[[North of Scotland Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners''' (4):''' 1999\u201300, 2007\u201308, [[2009\u201310 North of Scotland Cup|2009\u201310]], [[2011\u201312 North of Scotland Cup|2011\u201312]]\n*'''Chic Allan Cup:'''\n**'''Winners''' (2):''' 1994\u201395, 1998\u201399\n*'''Football Times Cup:'''\n**'''Winners''' (1):''' 1998\u201399\n*'''PCT Cup:'''\n**'''Winners''' (1):''' 1998\u201399\n\n== Records ==\n\n=== Attendance ===\n''All competitions''\n\n'''''At [[Telford Street Park]]'''''\n* '''Highest attendance:''' 4,931 v [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], 23 January 1996.\n* '''Lowest attendance:''' 491 v [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]], 11 April 1995.\n'''''At [[Caledonian Stadium]]'''''\n*'''Highest attendance:''' 7,753 v [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], 20 January 2008.\n*'''Lowest attendance:''' 635 v [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]], 14 September 1999.\n'''''At [[Pittodrie Stadium]]'''''\n* '''Highest attendance:''' 9,530 v [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], 16 October 2004.\n* '''Lowest attendance:''' 1,125 v [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], 23 November 2004.\n\n'''''At [[Tannadice Park]]*'''''\n\n* 11,296 v [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[1995\u201396 Scottish Cup|1995\u201396 Scottish Cup Quarter Final]], 9 March 1996.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>One-off, as Telford Street was deemed unsuitable for a Scottish Cup Quarter Final.\n\n=== Players ===\n* '''All-time top scorer:''' [[Dennis Wyness]], 139 Goals.\n* '''All-time most appearances:''' [[Ross Tokely]], 456 Appearances.\n* '''Longest spell at club:''' [[Ross Tokely]], 1996\u20132012, 17 years.\n* '''Highest transfer sum paid:''' [[John Rankin (footballer)|John Rankin]] from [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], \u00a365,000, July 2006.\n* '''Highest transfer sum received:''' [[Marius Niculae]] to [[CS Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]], \u00a3400,000, July 2008.\n* '''Most goals in a single season:''' [[Iain Stewart (footballer)|Iain Stewart]], 27 Goals, [[1996\u201397 Scottish Third Division|1996\u201397]].\n* '''Most goals in a match:''' [[Billy Mckay]], 5 goals, v [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]]. 23 July 2013.

The traditional recipe was 1.2 g sodium per 100 g. This was a direct result of Government policy with regard to salt levels in food.
