An Olympic team achieved third place in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], after beating the host [[Germany national football team|Germany]] earlier in the tournament. Norway also qualified for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], where they lost 2\u20131 after extra time against eventual champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. This was Norway's last World Cup finals appearance in 56 years.\n\nIn the post-war years, up to and including the 1980s, Norway was usually considered as one of the weaker teams in Europe. They never qualified for a World Cup or European Championship in this period, and usually finished near the bottom of their qualifying group. Nevertheless, Norway had a reputation for producing the occasional shock result, such as the 3\u20130 win against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in 1965, the 1\u20130 away win against [[France national football team|France]] in 1968, and the 2\u20131 victory against [[England national football team|England]] in 1981 that prompted radio commentator [[Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien]]'s famous \"Your boys took a hell of a beating\" rant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/sports-broadcasting/the-radio-man-who-gave-englands-boys-a-hell-of-a-beating/|title=The radio man who gave England\u2019s boys a hell of a beating|website=www.sportsjournalists.co.uk|publisher=[[Sports Journalists' Association]]|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nNorway had their most successful period from 1990 to 1998 under the legendary coach [[Egil Olsen|Egil \"Drillo\" Olsen]]. At its height in the mid-90s the team was [[FIFA World Rankings|ranked]] No. 2. Olsen started his training career with Norway with a 6\u20131 home victory against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] on 31 October 1990 and ended it on 27 June 1998 after a 0\u20131 defeat against Italy in the second stage of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States, Norway was knocked out at the group stage after a win against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], a defeat against Italy and a draw against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Norway failed to qualify for second round qualification on goal difference as all 4 teams in the group finished with 4 points. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in France, Norway was once again eliminated by Italy in the first round of the knock out stage after finishing second in their group, having drawn against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and won 2\u20131 against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].\n\nFormer under-21 coach [[Nils Johan Semb]] replaced Olsen after the planned retirement of the latter. Under Semb's guidance, Norway qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], which remains their last finals appearance to date. Semb resigned at the end of an unsuccessful qualifying campaign in 2003, and was replaced by [[\u00c5ge Hareide]]. Under Hareide, Norway came close to reaching both the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], but ultimately fell short on both occasions. Then, in 2008, it all fell apart as Norway failed to win a single game the entire calendar year. Hareide resigned at the end of 2008. His replacement, initially on a temporary basis, was the returning Egil Olsen, who began his second spell in charge with an away win against Germany, and subsequently signed a three-year contract. Olsen resigned in September 2013<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/nd6BJ/drillo-ferdig-som-landslagssjef-hoegmo-overtar-naa |title=Drillo ferdig som landslagssjef - H\u00f8gmo overtar n\u00e5 |language=Norwegian |website=www.vg.no |publisher=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref> after Norway lost at home to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and had limited chances to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] with one game to spare.

An Olympic team achieved third place in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], after beating the host [[Germany national football team|Germany]] earlier in the tournament. Norway also qualified for the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], where they lost 2\u20131 after extra time against eventual champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. This was Norway's last World Cup finals appearance in 56 years.\n\nIn the post-war years, up to and including the 1980s, Norway was usually considered as one of the weaker teams in Europe. They never qualified for a World Cup or European Championship in this period, and usually finished near the bottom of their qualifying group. Nevertheless, Norway had a reputation for producing the occasional shock result, such as the 3\u20130 win against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in 1965, the 1\u20130 away win against [[France national football team|France]] in 1968, and the 2\u20131 victory against [[England national football team|England]] in 1981 that prompted radio commentator [[Bj\u00f8rge Lillelien]]'s famous \"Your boys took a hell of a beating\" rant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsjournalists.co.uk/sports-broadcasting/the-radio-man-who-gave-englands-boys-a-hell-of-a-beating/|title=The radio man who gave England\u2019s boys a hell of a beating|website=www.sportsjournalists.co.uk|publisher=[[Sports Journalists' Association]]|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nNorway had their most successful period from 1990 to 1998 under the legendary coach [[Egil Olsen|Egil \"Drillo\" Olsen]]. At its height in the mid-90s the team was [[FIFA World Rankings|ranked]] No. 2. Olsen started his training career with Norway with a 6\u20131 home victory against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] on 31 October 1990 and ended it on 27 June 1998 after a 0\u20131 defeat against Italy in the second stage of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].\n\nIn the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States, Norway was knocked out at the group stage after a win against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], a defeat against Italy and a draw against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Norway failed to qualify for second round qualification on goal difference as all 4 teams in the group finished with 4 points. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in France, Norway was once again eliminated by Italy in the first round of the knock out stage after finishing second in their group, having drawn against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and won 2\u20131 against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].\n\nFormer under-21 coach [[Nils Johan Semb]] replaced Olsen after the planned retirement of the latter. Under Semb's guidance, Norway qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], which remains their last finals appearance to date. Semb resigned at the end of an unsuccessful qualifying campaign in 2003, and was replaced by [[\u00c5ge Hareide]]. Under Hareide, Norway came close to reaching both the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], but ultimately fell short on both occasions. Then, in 2008, it all fell apart as Norway failed to win a single game the entire calendar year. Hareide resigned at the end of 2008. His replacement, initially on a temporary basis, was the returning Egil Olsen, who began his second spell in charge with an away win against Germany, and subsequently signed a three-year contract. Olsen resigned in September 2013<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/nd6BJ/drillo-ferdig-som-landslagssjef-hoegmo-overtar-naa |title=Drillo ferdig som landslagssjef - H\u00f8gmo overtar n\u00e5 |language=Norwegian |website=www.vg.no |publisher=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref> after Norway lost at home to [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and had limited chances to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] with one game to spare.

In May 2008 the [[Football Association of Norway|NFF]] unveiled a new crest, a Viking-style Dragon wrapped around the NFF logo. After massive public pressure the crest was dropped.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrk.no/sport/fotball/nff-snur-i-drakt-saken-1.5762853 |title=NFF snur i drakt-saken |language=Norwegian |website=www.nrk.no |publisher=[[NRK]] |date=22 May 2008 |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref> Between the 1980s and the 1990s, Norway used the NFF logo in the opposite breast of the shirt together with the national flag on a white circle. On 12 December 2014, a new crest was presented. The crest primarily features the national flag, in addition, there are two lions taken from the [[Coat of arms of Norway]] on the top. The lions are facing each other while holding a blue miniature of the NFF logo, and between the lions and above the NFF logo, it says \"NORGE\" (Norway) in blue letters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dette emblemet skal pryde den norske landslagsdrakta |trans-title=This crest shall adorn the national kit of Norway|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/12/12/sport/fotball/nff/landslagsdrakt/36696756/|language=Norwegian|newspaper=Dagbladet}} Retrieved 12 December 2014</ref>\n\n==Competitive record==\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n\n===FIFA World Cup===\n{{main|Norway at the FIFA World Cup}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=9|[[FIFA World Cup]] record\n!width=1% rowspan=26|\n!colspan=7|[[FIFA World Cup qualification]] record\n|-\n!Year\n!Round\n!Position\n!{{Tooltip|Pld|Games played}}\n!{{Tooltip|W|Won}}\n!{{Tooltip|D|Drawn}}\n!{{Tooltip|L|Lost}}\n!{{Tooltip|GF|Goals for}}\n!{{Tooltip|GA|Goals against}}\n!{{Tooltip|Pld|Games played}}\n!{{Tooltip|W|Won}}\n!{{Tooltip|D|Drawn}}\n!{{Tooltip|L|Lost}}\n!{{Tooltip|GF|Goals for}}\n!{{Tooltip|GA|Goals against}}\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Uruguay}} [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]\n|rowspan=2 colspan=8|''Did not enter''\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Italy|1861}} [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|-\n|{{flagicon|France}} [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]]\n|Round of 16\n|12th\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|2\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|6\n|5\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Brazil|1889}} [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]\n|colspan=8|''Did not enter''\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|&nbsp;\u2013\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Switzerland}} [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]]\n|rowspan=10 colspan=8|''Did not qualify''\n|4\n|0\n|2\n|2\n|4\n|9\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]\n|4\n|1\n|0\n|3\n|3\n|15\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]]\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|4\n|3\n|11\n|-\n|{{flagicon|England}} [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]\n|6\n|3\n|1\n|2\n|10\n|5\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Mexico}} [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]]\n|4\n|1\n|0\n|3\n|4\n|13\n|-\n|{{flagicon|West Germany}} [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]\n|6\n|2\n|0\n|4\n|9\n|16\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Argentina}} [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]\n|4\n|2\n|0\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Spain}} [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]]\n|8\n|2\n|2\n|4\n|8\n|15\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Mexico}} [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]\n|8\n|1\n|3\n|4\n|4\n|10\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Italy}} [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]\n|8\n|2\n|2\n|4\n|10\n|9\n|-\n|{{flagicon|United States}} [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]\n|Group stage\n|17th\n|3\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|10\n|7\n|2\n|1\n|25\n|5\n|-\n|{{flagicon|France}} [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]\n|Round of 16\n|15th\n|4\n|1\n|2\n|1\n|5\n|5\n|8\n|6\n|2\n|0\n|21\n|2\n|-\n|{{flagicon|South Korea}} {{flagicon|Japan}} [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]\n|rowspan=5 colspan=8|''Did not qualify''\n|10\n|2\n|4\n|4\n|12\n|14\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Germany}} [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]\n|12\n|5\n|3\n|4\n|12\n|9\n|-\n|{{flagicon|South Africa}} [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]\n|8\n|2\n|4\n|2\n|9\n|7\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]\n|10\n|3\n|3\n|4\n|10\n|13\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]\n|10\n|4\n|1\n|5\n|17\n|16\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Qatar}} [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]]\n|rowspan=1 colspan=8|''To be determined''\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|{{flagicon|Canada}} {{flagicon|Mexico}} {{flagicon|United States}} [[2026 FIFA World Cup|2026]]\n|colspan=8|''To be determined''\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Total\n!Best: Round of 16\n!3/21\n!8\n!2\n!3\n!3\n!7\n!8\n!126\n!44\n!30\n!52\n!170\n!178\n|}\n\n===UEFA European Championship===\n{{main|Norway at the UEFA European Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=9|[[UEFA European Championship]] record\n!

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. \n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Large scale adoption began in 2019 and today virtually every telecommunication service provider in the developed world is upgrading its infrastructure to offer 5G functionality. \n\nThe [[Electromagnetic spectrum|frequency spectrum]] of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band, and low-band. Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132 Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz which is above the [[extremely high frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400 Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz.  Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost.  Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G.\n\n5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G. \nIn the [[United States]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] and [[AT&T Mobility|AT&T]] launched low-band services on the first week of December 2019. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray warns that speeds on their 600&nbsp;MHz 5G may be as low as 25 Mbit/s down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov|title=FCC testimony Neville Ray|last=Ray|first=Neville|date=June 18, 2018|website=FCC.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> AT&T, using 850&nbsp;MHz, will also usually deliver less than 100 Mbit/s in 2019. The performance will improve, but cannot be significantly greater than robust 4G in the same spectrum.\n\n[[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], AT&T, and almost all 5G providers in 2019 have latencies between 25\u201335 milliseconds. The \"air latency\" (between a phone and a tower) in 2019 equipment is 8\u201312 ms.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell.\n\nVerizon and a few others are using [[millimeter wave]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications for 5G Cellular: It Will Work! |journal = IEEE Access |date = 2013-01-01 |issn = 2169-3536 |pages = 335\u2013349 |volume = 1 |doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2013.2260813 |first = T.S. |last = Rappaport |first2 = Shu |last2 = Sun |first3 = R. |last3 = Mayzus |first4 = Hang |last4 = Zhao |first5 = Y. |last5 = Azar |first6 = K. |last6 = Wang |first7 = G.N. |last7 = Wong |first8 = J.K. |last8 = Schulz |first9 = M. |last9 = Samimi}}</ref> Millimeter waves have shorter range than [[microwave]]s, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size.

Some are only a few inches (several centimeters) long. \n\nMassive MIMO ([[multiple-input multiple-output]]), was deployed in 4G as early as 2016. Massive MIMO, typically uses 32 to 128 small antennas at each cell.

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

In its submission to the EU, Microsoft claimed that Linotype had failed to prove that it had been selling ''Frutiger'' and ''Frutiger Next'' prior to 2004.\n\nThe EU rejected these claims, and in February 2006 the EU revoked Microsoft's registration.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://oami.eu.int/PDF/design/invaldec/ICD%20000000743%20decision%20(EN).pdf\n |title       = Decision of the Invalidity Division (pdf)\n |date        = 6 February 2006\n |accessdate  = 2006-07-31\n |author      = Designs Department &ndash; Invalidity Division\n |publisher   = Office for the Harmonization in the Internal Market\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060508180329/http://oami.eu.int/pdf/design/invaldec/ICD%20000000743%20decision%20%28EN%29.pdf\n |archivedate = 8 May 2006\n}}</ref> Microsoft did not appeal the decision.

The German font foundry [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] protested, citing Segoe UI's similarity to its licensed ''[[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]'' family of typefaces.  In its submission to the EU, Microsoft claimed that Linotype had failed to prove that it had been selling ''Frutiger'' and ''Frutiger Next'' prior to 2004.\n\nThe EU rejected these claims, and in February 2006 the EU revoked Microsoft's registration.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://oami.eu.int/PDF/design/invaldec/ICD%20000000743%20decision%20(EN).pdf\n |title       = Decision of the Invalidity Division (pdf)\n |date        = 6 February 2006\n |accessdate  = 2006-07-31\n |author      = Designs Department &ndash; Invalidity Division\n |publisher   = Office for the Harmonization in the Internal Market\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060508180329/http://oami.eu.int/pdf/design/invaldec/ICD%20000000743%20decision%20%28EN%29.pdf\n |archivedate = 8 May 2006\n}}</ref> Microsoft did not appeal the decision.

In 2003, we acquired the original Segoe fonts and used them to develop an extended family of fonts retaining the Segoe name. Many of these new fonts received design patent protection in the United States. Segoe was not derived from Frutiger. Microsoft also has a current up-to-date license that allows us to distribute certain Frutiger fonts in connection with Microsoft products including Office and Windows. There are distinct differences between Segoe and Frutiger.
