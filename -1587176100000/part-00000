The campus purposes to aim for the first [[Applied Technology]] model-based [[polytechnic college]] which is not similarly with [[Engineering]] model-based [[University]]. Since it was inaugurated as a [[state university]] as one of the well-known several polytechnics in [[East Java]], which located in  [[Sampang Regency|Sampang]]. Then previously founded in the year of 2012, the polytechnic is under the auspices of [[Ministry of Education]] (''Kemendikbud''). In the year of 2014, the auspices was replaced to the [[Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (Indonesia)|Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education]] (''Kemenristekdikti''). ''Poltera'' is not only educational role-model of [[engineering science]] in which was focussing towards [[maritime transport]] and [[marine technology]] as a kick-starter, but is also adopts model of [[industry-oriented education]] in tomorrow's engineer for the future of polytechnic ('''POLTECH''').<ref name=\"ristekdikti\"/>\n\nSince 2012, ''Poltera'' was the first [[vocational education]] system in [[Madura]]. So, ''Poltera'' is located in Camplong by  [[UTC+07:00]] or West Indonesia Time (WIB), Province of [[East Java]], which institution is equivalent to the [[university]], especially the Institute of Technology. ''Poltera'' has been officially established to organizes [[academic]] and non-academic activities, as the initial pioneer with the coordination of two well-known institutions from Surabaya, such as the [[Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya]] ('''EEPIS''') and the [[Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic|Shipbuilding Institute of Polytechnic Surabaya]] ('''SHIPS''') as the temporary foundation for the readiness, towards establishment of an independent [[polytechnic college]]. For the constructions, lectures, academics and its facilities, in which explanation based on interview of first Director, [[Ingenieur|Ir.]] Achmad Ansori, [[Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies|DEA]]. that in mid-2016, ''Poltera'' plans to utilize existing building facilities for lectures program of the only applied courses in [[Madura]] and as the flagship campus in [[Indonesia]], especially [[Madura]]. In 2012, Poltera initially established a diploma-three of associate degree (D3) with a percentage of weight between practice and theory is 70% pre-industry in approach and 30% theory of application that can be reached normally with 6 semester (3 years). While going to the future, ''Poltera'' is plans to established a diploma-four of bachelor's degree (D4) which is equivalent to strata one of bachelor's degree (S1), the difference lies in the percentage of weight between research, rules, and regulations. Those are 40% of applied scientific and 60% scientific method that can be completed in the normal period for 8 semesters (4 years). Since establishment, the Union of polytechnic ('''UNIPOLTECH''') is an association of state polytechnic colleges in Indonesia (automatically), and Plotter Dies Natalis of birthday celebrations in which officially commemorated every 11 November by interval (born in 2012) of several achievement on progress.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Madura State Polytechnic Establishment in 2012 ===\n[[File:Minister Visitation.jpg|thumb|upright|260px|The Visitation of Minister of Education and Culture]]\nThe Polytechnic of Madura in establishment, the process was initially initiated by ''Yayasan Bina Sampang Mandiri'' (BSM), which was chaired by Ir.

It was greeted enthusiastically by the Regent of Sampang at that time. Furthermore, BSM Foundation in cooperation with the government of Sampang Regency realized the idea, and agreed to name the Polytechnic of Madura the so-called ''Poltera''. The [[Ministry of Education and Culture]] (''Mendikbud'') Indonesia, Prof. Dr. Ir. H. [[Muhammad Nuh]], DEA. (In the tenure of 22 October 2009 \u2013 20 October 2014) has given a tremendous appreciation of the request for the establishment of the Madurese Polytechnic. During his visit to the location of the Madura Polytechnic campus on 12 May 2012, he said that the Madurese Polytechnic will directly become the State Polytechnic, said ''Mendikbud'' Indonesia at that time period which is the alma mater of the [[Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology]] also known as ''Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember'' (ITS) in Surabaya, became the basic evidence of the seriousness of ''Kemendikbud'' of [[Indonesia]] in developing State Polytechnic in Madura. The establishment of ''Poltera'' aims to meet the needs of qualified human resources (Smart, Excellence, Dignity) for the [[industrial sector]] in which the graduates are prepared to become actors in development.\n\n{{cquote\n|The institutional status is clear with the presence of ''Permendikbud'' 67/2012 which states that ''Poltera'' is a state polytechnic, while funding support ranges from seventy-five billion rupiahs to one-hundred billion rupiahs, which is gradually disbursed. |||[[Prof.]] [[Muhammad Nuh]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2012/11/11/23390577/politeknik.negeri.madura.2014.akan.selesai|title=Politeknik Negeri Madura 2014 Akan Selesai|publisher=KOMPAS.com|year=2018|language=id|url-status=dead|access-date=2 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804202603/https://regional.kompas.com/read/2012/11/11/23390577/politeknik.negeri.madura.2014.akan.selesai|archive-date=4 August 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn accordance with the Presidential Regulation no. 10 Year 2016, ''Poltera'' is one of 35 colleges that have been established to become new public institutions.

in [[Madura island]] of [[Indonesia]]. The campus purposes to aim for the first [[Applied Technology]] model-based [[polytechnic college]] which is not similarly with [[Engineering]] model-based [[University]]. Since it was inaugurated as a [[state university]] as one of the well-known several polytechnics in [[East Java]], which located in  [[Sampang Regency|Sampang]]. Then previously founded in the year of 2012, the polytechnic is under the auspices of [[Ministry of Education]] (''Kemendikbud''). In the year of 2014, the auspices was replaced to the [[Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education (Indonesia)|Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education]] (''Kemenristekdikti''). ''Poltera'' is not only educational role-model of [[engineering science]] in which was focussing towards [[maritime transport]] and [[marine technology]] as a kick-starter, but is also adopts model of [[industry-oriented education]] in tomorrow's engineer for the future of polytechnic ('''POLTECH''').<ref name=\"ristekdikti\"/>\n\nSince 2012, ''Poltera'' was the first [[vocational education]] system in [[Madura]]. So, ''Poltera'' is located in Camplong by  [[UTC+07:00]] or West Indonesia Time (WIB), Province of [[East Java]], which institution is equivalent to the [[university]], especially the Institute of Technology. ''Poltera'' has been officially established to organizes [[academic]] and non-academic activities, as the initial pioneer with the coordination of two well-known institutions from Surabaya, such as the [[Electronic Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya]] ('''EEPIS''') and the [[Surabaya Shipbuilding State Polytechnic|Shipbuilding Institute of Polytechnic Surabaya]] ('''SHIPS''') as the temporary foundation for the readiness, towards establishment of an independent [[polytechnic college]]. For the constructions, lectures, academics and its facilities, in which explanation based on interview of first Director, [[Ingenieur|Ir.]] Achmad Ansori, [[Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies|DEA]]. that in mid-2016, ''Poltera'' plans to utilize existing building facilities for lectures program of the only applied courses in [[Madura]] and as the flagship campus in [[Indonesia]], especially [[Madura]]. In 2012, Poltera initially established a diploma-three of associate degree (D3) with a percentage of weight between practice and theory is 70% pre-industry in approach and 30% theory of application that can be reached normally with 6 semester (3 years). While going to the future, ''Poltera'' is plans to established a diploma-four of bachelor's degree (D4) which is equivalent to strata one of bachelor's degree (S1), the difference lies in the percentage of weight between research, rules, and regulations. Those are 40% of applied scientific and 60% scientific method that can be completed in the normal period for 8 semesters (4 years). Since establishment, the Union of polytechnic ('''UNIPOLTECH''') is an association of state polytechnic colleges in Indonesia (automatically), and Plotter Dies Natalis of birthday celebrations in which officially commemorated every 11 November by interval (born in 2012) of several achievement on progress.\n\n== History ==\n=== The Madura State Polytechnic Establishment in 2012 ===\n[[File:Minister Visitation.jpg|thumb|upright|260px|The Visitation of Minister of Education and Culture]]\nThe Polytechnic of Madura in establishment, the process was initially initiated by ''Yayasan Bina Sampang Mandiri'' (BSM), which was chaired by Ir.

Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The [[House of Grimaldi]] has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.<ref>In fact [[Fran\u00e7ois Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], who captured [[Monaco-Ville|the Rock]] on the night of 8 January 1297, was forced to flee Monaco only four years after the fabled raid, never to come back. The Grimaldi family was not able to permanently secure their holding until 1419 when they purchased Monaco, along with two neighbouring villages, [[Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].

Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small [[Military of Monaco|military units]].\n\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, [[Monte Carlo Casino|Monte Carlo]], and a railway connection to Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montecarlolegend.com/monte-carlo-the-birth-of-a-legend/|title=Monte Carlo: The Birth of a Legend|publisher=SBM Group |date=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref> Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. \n\nIn more recent years, Monaco has become a major [[banking centre]] and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, [[High value products|high-value-added]], non-polluting industries. The state has no [[income tax]], [[Tax rates around the world|low business taxes]], and is well known for being a [[tax haven]]. It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race [[Monaco Grand Prix]], one of the original Grands Prix of [[Formula One]] and birthplace of [[Scuderia Ferrari]] driver [[Charles Leclerc]]. The principality has a club football team, [[AS Monaco]], who have become [[List of French football champions|French]] champions on multiple occasions.\n\nMonaco is not formally a part of the [[European Union]] (EU), but it [[Monaco\u2013European Union relations|participates in certain EU policies]], including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the [[euro]] as its sole currency (prior to this it used the [[Mon\u00e9gasque franc]]). Monaco joined the [[Council of Europe]] in 2004.

Though the [[Republic of Genoa]] would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and [[Spain]] left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the [[French Revolution]], but after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] it was put under the care of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. \n\nIn the 19th century, when [[Sardinia]] became a part of [[Italy]], the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the [[Axis powers]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], before finally being liberated.

On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below {{convert|20|\u00b0C}} in this season.

However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the [[euro]]. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the [[Monegasque franc]]. Monaco has acquired the right to mint [[euro coins]] with [[Monegasque euro coins|Monegasque designs]] on its national side.\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n[[File:Le casino de Monte-Carlo.JPG|thumb|[[Monte Carlo Casino]]]]\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of [[Florestan I, Prince of Monaco|Florestan I]] in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's [[Petite bourgeoisie|petite-bourgeois]] regime, however, a dignitary such as the [[Prince of Monaco]] was not allowed to operate a gambling house.<ref name=\"state1\"/>  All this changed in the dissolute [[Second French Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]]. The [[House of Grimaldi]] was in dire need of money. \n\nThe towns of [[Menton, France|Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after [[Charles III, Prince of Monaco|Charles III]] assumed the throne in 1856.\n\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc|Fran\u00e7ois]] and [[Louis Blanc (businessman)|Louis Blanc]] for 1.7&nbsp;million francs. \n\nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\"<ref name=\"Craps\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crapsdicecontrol.com/monte_carlo.htm|title=History of Monte Carlo Casino|publisher=Craps Dice Control|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref> They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\n\nThe Blancs opened [[Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo]] in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iptv.org/series.cfm/9038/rick_steves_europe/ep:504|title=Rick Steves' Europe: Little Europe: San Marino, Monaco, Vatican City, Liechtenstein, and Andorra|publisher=|access-date=27 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114170925/http://www.iptv.org/series.cfm/9038/rick_steves_europe/ep:504|archive-date=14 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ricksteves.com/tvr/littleeurope504_scr.htm |title=Rick Steves Europe: Little Europe: Five Microcountries |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its [[Oceanographic Museum]] and the [[Monte Carlo Opera House]], 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.<ref>{{cite web| author=Keremcan| url=https://www.gamblingherald.com/why-do-monaco-laws-forbid-locals-from-gambling/| title=Why Do Monaco Laws Forbid Locals from Gambling?| work=Gambling Herald |date=23 August 2016| accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\n\nToday, [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco]], which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the [[Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris]], the [[Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino]] and the [[Sun Casino]].

Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nIn 1998, the [[Centre for Tax Policy and Administration]], part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known [[tax haven]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.escapeartist.com/OREQ24/Offshore_Tax_Havens.html |title=Obscure Tax Havens |publisher=Escapeartist.com |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Marshall Islands]].  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.<ref>''Declaration of 18 April 2004, by the representative of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Centre for Tax Policy and Administration Gabriel Makhlouf regarding the list of alleged [[tax haven]]s non-cooperatives countries comparable''</ref><ref>''Stage Report 2004: Project of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] on the detrimental tax practices, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris, 2004''</ref>  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.

Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small [[Military of Monaco|military units]].\n\nEconomic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, [[Monte Carlo Casino|Monte Carlo]], and a railway connection to Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montecarlolegend.com/monte-carlo-the-birth-of-a-legend/|title=Monte Carlo: The Birth of a Legend|publisher=SBM Group |date=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref> Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major [[banking centre]] and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, [[High value products|high-value-added]], non-polluting industries. The state has no [[income tax]], [[Tax rates around the world|low business taxes]], and is well known for being a [[tax haven]]. It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race [[Monaco Grand Prix]], one of the original Grands Prix of [[Formula One]] and birthplace of [[Scuderia Ferrari]] driver [[Charles Leclerc]]. The principality has a club football team, [[AS Monaco]], who have become [[List of French football champions|French]] champions on multiple occasions.\n\nMonaco is not formally a part of the [[European Union]] (EU), but it [[Monaco\u2013European Union relations|participates in certain EU policies]], including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the [[euro]] as its sole currency (prior to this it used the [[Mon\u00e9gasque franc]]). Monaco joined the [[Council of Europe]] in 2004.

An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]], contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the [[Republic of Genoa]] would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and [[Spain]] left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the [[French Revolution]], but after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] it was put under the care of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In the 19th century, when [[Sardinia]] became a part of [[Italy]], the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the [[Axis powers]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the [[Jews|Jewish]] population and execution of several [[French Resistance|resistance]] members from Monaco.

On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below {{convert|20|\u00b0C}} in this season.

However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the [[euro]]. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the [[Monegasque franc]]. Monaco has acquired the right to mint [[euro coins]] with [[Monegasque euro coins|Monegasque designs]] on its national side.\n\n=== Gambling industry ===\n[[File:Le casino de Monte-Carlo.JPG|thumb|[[Monte Carlo Casino]]]]\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of [[Florestan I, Prince of Monaco|Florestan I]] in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's [[Petite bourgeoisie|petite-bourgeois]] regime, however, a dignitary such as the [[Prince of Monaco]] was not allowed to operate a gambling house.<ref name=\"state1\"/>  All this changed in the dissolute [[Second French Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]]. The [[House of Grimaldi]] was in dire need of money. The towns of [[Menton, France|Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after [[Charles III, Prince of Monaco|Charles III]] assumed the throne in 1856.\n\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates [[Fran\u00e7ois Blanc|Fran\u00e7ois]] and [[Louis Blanc (businessman)|Louis Blanc]] for 1.7&nbsp;million francs. The Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\"<ref name=\"Craps\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crapsdicecontrol.com/monte_carlo.htm|title=History of Monte Carlo Casino|publisher=Craps Dice Control|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref> They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\n\nThe Blancs opened [[Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo]] in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iptv.org/series.cfm/9038/rick_steves_europe/ep:504|title=Rick Steves' Europe: Little Europe: San Marino, Monaco, Vatican City, Liechtenstein, and Andorra|publisher=|access-date=27 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114170925/http://www.iptv.org/series.cfm/9038/rick_steves_europe/ep:504|archive-date=14 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ricksteves.com/tvr/littleeurope504_scr.htm |title=Rick Steves Europe: Little Europe: Five Microcountries |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its [[Oceanographic Museum]] and the [[Monte Carlo Opera House]], 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.<ref>{{cite web| author=Keremcan| url=https://www.gamblingherald.com/why-do-monaco-laws-forbid-locals-from-gambling/| title=Why Do Monaco Laws Forbid Locals from Gambling?| work=Gambling Herald |date=23 August 2016| accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\n\nToday, [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco]], which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the [[Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris]], the [[Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino]] and the [[Sun Casino]]. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the [[Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort|Monte Carlo Bay Casino]], which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"[[ticket-in, ticket-out]]\" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite book | year=2006 | title=Frommer's Provence and the Riviera (Fifth. ed.) | author=Porter, D. | author2=D.

Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.<ref name=telegraph/>\n\nIn 1998, the [[Centre for Tax Policy and Administration]], part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known [[tax haven]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.escapeartist.com/OREQ24/Offshore_Tax_Havens.html |title=Obscure Tax Havens |publisher=Escapeartist.com |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Marshall Islands]].  The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.<ref>''Declaration of 18 April 2004, by the representative of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Centre for Tax Policy and Administration Gabriel Makhlouf regarding the list of alleged [[tax haven]]s non-cooperatives countries comparable''</ref><ref>''Stage Report 2004: Project of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] on the detrimental tax practices, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris, 2004''</ref>  Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions.  In 2009, Monaco went a step farther, and secured a place on the \"white list\", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.<ref name=telegraph/>\n\nIn 2000, the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters.

{"title_page": "Acridine orange", "text_new": "'''Acridine orange''' is an [[organic compound]]. It is used as a [[nucleic acid]]-selective [[fluorescent]] [[dye]], that has cationic properties useful for cell cycle determination. Being cell-permeable, it interacts with [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] by [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]] or [[electrostatic attraction]]s, respectively. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to [[fluorescein]], with a maximum excitation at 502 [[Nanometre|nm]] and 525&nbsp;nm (green). When acridine orange associates with RNA, the maximum excitation shifts to 460&nbsp;nm (blue), and the maximum emission shifts to 650&nbsp;nm (red). Acridine orange will also enter acidic compartments such as, lysosomes where it becomes protonated and sequestered. Within these low [[pH]] vesicles, the dye emits red fluorescence when excited by blue light. Thus, acridine orange can be used to visualize primary [[lysosomes]] and phagolysosomes that may include products of [[phagocytosis]] of apoptotic cells.

Bright orange organisms are easily detected against a black to faint green background.

When it binds with RNA, the maximum excitation is located at 460&nbsp;nm (blue), and the maximum emission is located at 650&nbsp;nm (red).

The use of acridine orange in clinical applications has become widely accepted, mainly focusing on highlighting bacteria in blood cultures.
