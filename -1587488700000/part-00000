Over the next two decades, the company expanded to produce pencil cases and school supplies. In 1926, Hassenfeld Brothers was incorporated; Hillel left for another textile business while Henry took charge of the corporation. They began making their own pencils when their pencil supplier began making pencil cases as well.<ref name=idch>{{cite web|title=Hasbro, Inc. History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hasbro-inc-history/|work=International Directory of Company Histories Vol. 16.|publisher=St. James Press|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nHassenfeld Brothers produced modeling clay and then doctor and nurse kits as their first toys, and they became primarily a toy company by 1942. Hillel died in 1943 and Henry Hassenfeld became CEO, while his son Merrill became president. The company entered the plastic fields during World War II to support its toy line.<ref name=idch/> Hassenfeld Brothers' first toy hit was [[Mr. Potato Head]],<ref name=idch/> which the company purchased from [[George Lerner]] in 1952. In 1954, the company became a [[Disney]] major licensee.<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1960, Henry died and Merrill took over the parent company, and his older brother Harold ran the pencil-making business of Empire Pencil. Hassenfeld Brothers expanded to Canada with Hassenfeld Brothers (Canada) Ltd. in 1961. The company was approached in 1963 to license a toy based on ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possibly short-lived television series. Instead, Hassenfeld Brothers produced the [[G.I. Joe]] toy in 1964 which they termed an \"[[action figure]]\" in order to market it to boys who wouldn't want to play with dolls. In 1964 and 1965, G.I. Joe accounted for two-thirds of Hassenfeld's sales.<ref name=idch/>\n\n===Hasbro Industries===\nThe company had previously sold toys under the Hasbro trade name, and it shortened its name to '''Hasbro Industries''' in 1968 and sold a minor stake in the corporation to the public. The unpopular [[Vietnam War]] was at its height in 1969, so Hasbro redesigned GI Joe to be less militaristic and more adventure oriented.<ref name=idch/> Its promotional efforts included the catchphrase \"Boy Oh Boy! It's A Hasbro Toy!\" in television commercials and print ads. Also in 1969, Hasbro bought [[Claster Television|Burt Claster Enterprises]] which produced \"[[Romper Room]]\" and had just begun a Romper Room toy line. A month-long Teamsters strike and Far Eastern supplier troubles caused the company to have a $1 million loss for the year.<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1970, Hasbro began a plan of diversification and opened the Romper Room Nursery School franchise chain to cash in on President [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan which subsidized day care for working mothers. By 1975, the company had ended the nursery chain. Hasbro also entered the cookware field with the [[Galloping Gourmet]] line based on a television cooking show.\n\nTwo new 1970s toys were public relations disasters. One of the toys was named [[Lawn darts|Javelin Darts]] which were similar to the ancient Roman ''[[plumbata]]''. On December 19, 1988, the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission]] banned lawn darts from sale in the [[United States]] due to their hazards as a flying projectile with a sharp metal point causing multiple deaths.<ref name=\"CPSC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97122.html |title=Lawn Darts Are Banned and Should Be Destroyed |accessdate=2011-01-25 |date=1997-05-15 |publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission |quote=Pointed lawn darts, intended for use in an outdoor game, have been responsible for the deaths of three children.

Both were recalled. Romper Room and its toy line had continued success, although [[Action for Children's Television]] citizens group considered the program to be an advertising channel for toys.<ref name=idch/>\n\nMerrill Hassenfeld took over as CEO in 1974, and his son [[Stephen D. Hassenfeld]] became president. The company became profitable once again but had mixed results due to cash flow problems from increasing the number of toys in the line to offset G.I. Joe's declining sales. Hasbro ended the G.I. Joe line in 1975 because of the rising price of plastic and crude oil's increasing prices. In 1977, Hasbro's losses were $2.5 million, and the company held a large debt load. That same year, Hasbro acquired licensing rights to ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoon characters. With the financial situation poor, Hasbro's bankers made the company temporarily stop dividend payments in early 1979. The toy division's losses increased Harold Hassenfeld's resentment regarding the company's treatment of the Empire Pencil subsidiary as Empire received lower levels of capital spending to profits than did the toy division.\n\nWith Merrill's death in 1979, Harold did not recognize Stephen's authority as the successor to the chairman and CEO position. As a solution, Hasbro spun off Empire Pencil in 1980, which was the nation's largest pencil maker, with Harold trading his Hasbro shares for those of Empire. Stephen then became both the CEO and chairman of the board. Between 1978 and 1981, Stephen reduced the Hasbro product line by one-third and its new products by one-half. Hasbro focused on simple, low cost, longer life-cycle toys like Mr. Potato Head. Hasbro thus stayed out of the electronic games field which went bust in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1982, Hasbro revived its G.I. Joe line with the help of [[Marvel Comics]], as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] commando based on current events. The company launched the successful [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] toy line along with a [[The Transformers (TV series)|children's animated TV series]] two years later. With the toys and TV series being popular, Stephen Hassenfeld posed with the toys for a ''People'' magazine cover photo.\n\nIn 1982, Hasbro produced the successful toy franchise [[My Little Pony]]. In 1983, they purchased GLENCO Infant Items, a manufacturer of infant products and the world's largest bib producer, and Knickerbocker Toy Company, a struggling [[Warner Communications]] subsidiary. Hasbro paid 37% of its stock to Warner, which was paid into Hasbro's executive-controlled voting trust, and also received a cash infusion. In 1984, [[Alan G. Hassenfeld]] took over as president from his brother Stephen, who continued as CEO and chairman. That same year, the company was the nation's sixth best-selling toymaker, and then acquired the [[Milton Bradley Company]], which was the nation's fifth best-selling toymaker. This brought [[The Game of Life]], [[Twister (game)|Twister]], [[Easy Money (board game)|Easy Money]], and [[Playskool]] into the Hasbro fold and transformed Hasbro into '''Hasbro Bradley'''. Stephen Hassenfeld became the merged company's president and CEO, with Milton Bradley chief James Shea Jr. taking the chairman position. However, the executives clashed and Shea left after a few months, and Stephen and Alan returned to their previous positions.<ref name=idch/>\n\n===Hasbro===\n====1985\u20132007====\nIn 1985, the company changed its name again to just '''Hasbro, Inc.'''<ref name=idch/> The  Jumpstarters toys were the subject of a lawsuit in 1985 when Hasbro sued a toy manufacturer for selling toys based on their Transformers design. Hasbro won the suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/780_F2d_189.htm|title=Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc., 780 F.2d 189 (2nd Cir. 1985)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hasbro moved past [[Mattel]] to become the world's largest toy company.  Hasbro then moved to outsell Mattel's [[Barbie]] in the fashion doll market with the 1986 introduction of [[Jerrica Benton|Jem]], a record producer/rock musician dual identity fashion doll. Jem initially posted strong sales but plummeted and was withdrawn from the market in 1987.  Hasbro followed up in 1988 with [[Maxie's World#Maxie toy line|Maxie]], a Barbie-sized blonde doll, so that Barbie clothing and accessories would fit. Maxie lasted until 1990.<ref name=idch/>\n\nUnder Alan's initiative in the late 1980s, Hasbro moved to increase international sales by taking toys overseas that had failed in the US market and selling them for as much as four times the original price. This increased international sales from $268 million in 1985 to $433 million in 1988.<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1988, Hasbro purchased part of [[Coleco]] Industries' indoor and outdoor children's furniture and ride-on toy product lines for $21 million including two just closed manufacturing plants in Amsterdam, N.Y.<ref>{{cite news|title=Company News; Hasbro in Accord For Coleco Lines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/business/company-news-hasbro-in-accord-for-coleco-lines.html?src=pm|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 12, 1988}}</ref>  In July 1989, Hasbro acquired bankrupt [[Coleco]] for $85 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Company News; Hasbro's Purchase Of Coleco's Assets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/13/business/company-news-hasbro-s-purchase-of-coleco-s-assets.html?src=pm|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 13, 1989|agency=AP}}</ref> Stephen Hassenfeld died later that year with the company having gone from sales of $104 million in the year he took control to 1989 sales of over $1.4 billion.<ref name=idch/>\n\nAlan succeeded Stephen as chairman and CEO. In 1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka Corp. for $486 million, along with its units [[Parker Brothers]], the maker of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], and [[Kenner Products]]. Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers were merged into one division. Alan moved to expand Hasbro overseas with new units in Greece, Hungary, and Mexico.<ref name=idch/>\n\nAlan saw the Far East as an important market to expand. In 1992, Hasbro purchased Nomura Toys Ltd. in Japan, and majority ownership of Palmyra, a Southeast Asian toy distributor. These increased the proportion of international sales from 22% in 1985 to 45% ($1.28 billion) in 1995. In 1993, Hasbro lost its bid for [[J. W. Spear & Sons]], a U.K.-based game maker, to [[Mattel]].<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn the US, Hasbro's growth since 1980 were from acquisitions and the leveraging of the new assets. New product development was not as successful except for movie and TV tie-in product lines with [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] and [[Barney & Friends|Barney]].  Thus, US sales were stagnant in the early 1990s, falling from 1993 to 1995.

For example, in addition to original [[Scrabble]], the game is also available as \"Scrabble Deluxe Edition\", \"Scrabble Deluxe Travel Edition\",\"Scrabble Junior\", and \"Scrabble Onyx Edition\".\n\nHasbro also offers [[games of physical skill]] such as:\n\n* ''[[Bop It]]''\n* ''[[Jenga]]''\n\nThey also formerly sold : \n* ''[[Brain Warp]]'' and its sister products which include ''Brain Shift'', ''Brain Bash'', ''Death Star Escape'', ''Hyperslide'' and ''Torx''. \n* ''[[Bull's-Eye Ball]]''\n\nHasbro also offers a memory game called ''Simon'' which involves memorising sequences of colors and lights.\n\nIn 1995, Hasbro began a short-lived [[Video game developer|video game development]] and [[video game publisher|publishing]] venture called [[Hasbro Interactive]], but disbanded it in 2001 when it was bought by the now defunct [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]. Now Hasbro develops video games based on its brands through third-party developers and licensing strategies, notably with major American companies such as [[Activision]], [[Electronic Arts]], and [[THQ]]. Following the rise of [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet PCs]] in the 2010s, as well as major video gaming publishers cutting back on releasing games based on licensed IPs for various reasons, such as [[Great Recession|economic slumps]], several of Hasbro's brands were licensed towards mobile game developers such as [[Gameloft]], releasing their games under the label Hasbro Gaming.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, Hasbro announced that it would be introducing a musical [[toothbrush]] to the market. The ''[[Tooth Tunes]]'', released in early 2007, transmits music from the [[Human mandible|jawbone]] to the ear when the bristles touch the teeth.\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\nIn 2007, a workers' rights group investigated several of Hasbro's Chinese suppliers and found that, in one instance, a toy factory in China's [[Guangxi Province]] had hired 1000 [[junior high school]] students. The same group discovered other widespread [[Labour law|labor violations]], including unsafe working conditions, mandatory overtime, [[verbal abuse]] and [[sexual harassment]] of employees. Hasbro issued a statement, saying that it would \"act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes\" and had \"increased the intensity of [its] ongoing safety review efforts.\" Critics pointed out that Hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories. Hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors. These auditors make unannounced visits to the [[East Asian]] subcontractors. Factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/business/worldbusiness/22factory.html?ref=business \"U.S. Group Accuses Chinese Toy Factories of Labor Abuses\"] from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nHasbro has also been criticized for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups. For example, a letter spread widely on [[social media]] in November 2012 written by a six-year-old Irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game ''[[Guess Who?]]''<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/guess-whos-sexist-classic-board-games-gender-bias-leaves-sixyearold-fuming-8324067.html \"Guess Who's sexist?

As such, there have been criticisms that Hasbro's toys reinforce [[gender stereotypes]]. For example, in December 2012, 13-year-old McKenna Pope started a campaign on [[Change.org]], calling on the company to create a \"boy-friendly\" version of the popular [[Easy-Bake Oven]] and to feature boys on their packaging and materials.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/teen-starts-campaign-gender-neutral-easy-bake-oven-155338662--abc-news-topstories.html \"Teen starts campaign for gender neutral Easy Bake Oven\"] from ''[[Good Morning America]]''</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">[https://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/04/business/la-fi-easy-bake-20121204 \"Teen girl petitions Hasbro to market Easy Bake Oven also to boys\"] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> Within a week, over 30,000 people signed her petition.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/living/gender-toy-marketing-petition/?hpt=hp_c2|title=Teen says pink toy ovens discourage boys from kitchen play|author=Emanuella Grinberg, CNN|date=December 6, 2012|work=CNN}}</ref>\n\nHasbro was criticized for \"sexist\" product design when its 2015 [[Star Wars]] [[Monopoly board game]] failed to feature [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the female protagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', while including all of the supporting male characters. Hasbro explained that Rey was left out of the Monopoly game to avoid spoilers, because the game was released months before the movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/1/5/10715144/hasbro-explains-why-rey-was-excluded-from-star-wars-monopoly|title=Hasbro explains why Rey was excluded from Star Wars: Monopoly (update)|date=January 5, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> On January 5, 2016, Hasbro announced that Rey would be included in future versions.

History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hasbro-inc-history/|work=International Directory of Company Histories Vol. 16.|publisher=St. James Press|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nHassenfeld Brothers produced modeling clay and then doctor and nurse kits as their first toys, and they became primarily a toy company by 1942. Hillel died in 1943 and Henry Hassenfeld became CEO, while his son Merrill became president. The company entered the plastic fields during World War II to support its toy line.<ref name=idch/> Hassenfeld Brothers' first toy hit was [[Mr. Potato Head]],<ref name=idch/> which the company purchased from [[George Lerner]] in 1952. In 1954, the company became a [[Disney]] major licensee.<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1960, Henry died and Merrill took over the parent company, and his older brother Harold ran the pencil-making business of Empire Pencil. Hassenfeld Brothers expanded to Canada with Hassenfeld Brothers (Canada) Ltd. in 1961. The company was approached in 1963 to license a toy based on ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possibly short-lived television series. Instead, Hassenfeld Brothers produced the [[G.I. Joe]] toy in 1964 which they termed an \"[[action figure]]\" in order to market it to boys who wouldn't want to play with dolls. In 1964 and 1965, G.I. Joe accounted for two-thirds of Hassenfeld's sales.<ref name=idch/>\n\n===Hasbro Industries===\nThe company had previously sold toys under the Hasbro trade name, and it shortened its name to '''Hasbro Industries''' in 1968 and sold a minor stake in the corporation to the public. The unpopular [[Vietnam War]] was at its height in 1969, so Hasbro redesigned GI Joe to be less militaristic and more adventure oriented.<ref name=idch/> Its promotional efforts included the catchphrase \"Boy Oh Boy! It's A Hasbro Toy!\" in television commercials and print ads. Also in 1969, Hasbro bought [[Claster Television|Burt Claster Enterprises]] which produced \"[[Romper Room]]\" and had just begun a Romper Room toy line. A month-long Teamsters strike and Far Eastern supplier troubles caused the company to have a $1 million loss for the year.<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1970, Hasbro began a plan of diversification and opened the Romper Room Nursery School franchise chain to cash in on President [[Richard M. Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan which subsidized day care for working mothers. By 1975, the company had ended the nursery chain. Hasbro also entered the cookware field with the [[Galloping Gourmet]] line based on a television cooking show.\n\nTwo new 1970s toys were public relations disasters. One of the toys was named [[Lawn darts|Javelin Darts]] which were similar to the ancient Roman ''[[plumbata]]''. On December 19, 1988, the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission]] banned lawn darts from sale in the [[United States]] due to their hazards as a flying projectile with a sharp metal point causing multiple deaths.<ref name=\"CPSC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML97/97122.html |title=Lawn Darts Are Banned and Should Be Destroyed |accessdate=2011-01-25 |date=1997-05-15 |publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission |quote=Pointed lawn darts, intended for use in an outdoor game, have been responsible for the deaths of three children.

Both were recalled. Romper Room and its toy line had continued success, although [[Action for Children's Television]] citizens group considered the program to be an advertising channel for toys.<ref name=idch/>\n\nMerrill Hassenfeld took over as CEO in 1974, and his son [[Stephen D. Hassenfeld]] became president. The company became profitable once again but had mixed results due to cash flow problems from increasing the number of toys in the line to offset G.I. Joe's declining sales. Hasbro ended the G.I. Joe line in 1975 because of the rising price of plastic and crude oil's increasing prices. In 1977, Hasbro's losses were $2.5 million, and the company held a large debt load. That same year, Hasbro acquired licensing rights to ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoon characters. With the financial situation poor, Hasbro's bankers made the company temporarily stop dividend payments in early 1979. The toy division's losses increased Harold Hassenfeld's resentment regarding the company's treatment of the Empire Pencil subsidiary as Empire received lower levels of capital spending to profits than did the toy division.\n\nWith Merrill's death in 1979, Harold did not recognize Stephen's authority as the successor to the chairman and CEO position. As a solution, Hasbro spun off Empire Pencil in 1980, which was the nation's largest pencil maker, with Harold trading his Hasbro shares for those of Empire. Stephen then became both the CEO and chairman of the board. Between 1978 and 1981, Stephen reduced the Hasbro product line by one-third and its new products by one-half. Hasbro focused on simple, low cost, longer life-cycle toys like Mr. Potato Head. Hasbro thus stayed out of the electronic games field which went bust in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1982, Hasbro revived its G.I. Joe line with the help of [[Marvel Comics]], as an [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorist]] commando based on current events. The company launched the successful [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] toy line along with a [[The Transformers (TV series)|children's animated TV series]] two years later. With the toys and TV series being popular, Stephen Hassenfeld posed with the toys for a ''People'' magazine cover photo.\n\nIn 1982, Hasbro produced the successful toy franchise [[My Little Pony]]. In 1983, they purchased GLENCO Infant Items, a manufacturer of infant products and the world's largest bib producer, and Knickerbocker Toy Company, a struggling [[Warner Communications]] subsidiary. Hasbro paid 37% of its stock to Warner, which was paid into Hasbro's executive-controlled voting trust, and also received a cash infusion. In 1984, [[Alan G. Hassenfeld]] took over as president from his brother Stephen, who continued as CEO and chairman. That same year, the company was the nation's sixth best-selling toymaker, and then acquired the [[Milton Bradley Company]], which was the nation's fifth best-selling toymaker. This brought [[The Game of Life]], [[Twister (game)|Twister]], [[Easy Money (board game)|Easy Money]], and [[Playskool]] into the Hasbro fold and transformed Hasbro into '''Hasbro Bradley'''. Stephen Hassenfeld became the merged company's president and CEO, with Milton Bradley chief James Shea Jr. taking the chairman position. However, the executives clashed and Shea left after a few months, and Stephen and Alan returned to their previous positions.<ref name=idch/>\n\n===Hasbro===\n====1985\u20132007====\nIn 1985, the company changed its name again to just '''Hasbro, Inc.'''<ref name=idch/> The  Jumpstarters toys were the subject of a lawsuit in 1985 when Hasbro sued a toy manufacturer for selling toys based on their Transformers design. Hasbro won the suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/780_F2d_189.htm|title=Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc., 780 F.2d 189 (2nd Cir. 1985)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hasbro moved past [[Mattel]] to become the world's largest toy company.  Hasbro then moved to outsell Mattel's [[Barbie]] in the fashion doll market with the 1986 introduction of [[Jerrica Benton|Jem]], a record producer/rock musician dual identity fashion doll. Jem initially posted strong sales but plummeted and was withdrawn from the market in 1987.  Hasbro followed up in 1988 with [[Maxie's World#Maxie toy line|Maxie]], a Barbie-sized blonde doll, so that Barbie clothing and accessories would fit. Maxie lasted until 1990.<ref name=idch/>\n\nUnder Alan's initiative in the late 1980s, Hasbro moved to increase international sales by taking toys overseas that had failed in the US market and selling them for as much as four times the original price. This increased international sales from $268 million in 1985 to $433 million in 1988.<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1988, Hasbro purchased part of [[Coleco]] Industries' indoor and outdoor children's furniture and ride-on toy product lines for $21 million including two just closed manufacturing plants in Amsterdam, N.Y.<ref>{{cite news|title=Company News; Hasbro in Accord For Coleco Lines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/business/company-news-hasbro-in-accord-for-coleco-lines.html?src=pm|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 12, 1988}}</ref>  In July 1989, Hasbro acquired bankrupt [[Coleco]] for $85 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Company News; Hasbro's Purchase Of Coleco's Assets|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/13/business/company-news-hasbro-s-purchase-of-coleco-s-assets.html?src=pm|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 13, 1989|agency=AP}}</ref> Stephen Hassenfeld died later that year with the company having gone from sales of $104 million in the year he took control to 1989 sales of over $1.4 billion.<ref name=idch/>\n\nAlan succeeded Stephen as chairman and CEO. In 1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka Corp. for $486 million, along with its units [[Parker Brothers]], the maker of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], and [[Kenner Products]]. Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers were merged into one division. Alan moved to expand Hasbro overseas with new units in Greece, Hungary, and Mexico.<ref name=idch/>\n\nAlan saw the Far East as an important market to expand. In 1992, Hasbro purchased Nomura Toys Ltd. in Japan, and majority ownership of Palmyra, a Southeast Asian toy distributor. These increased the proportion of international sales from 22% in 1985 to 45% ($1.28 billion) in 1995. In 1993, Hasbro lost its bid for [[J. W. Spear & Sons]], a U.K.-based game maker, to [[Mattel]].<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn the US, Hasbro's growth since 1980 were from acquisitions and the leveraging of the new assets. New product development was not as successful except for movie and TV tie-in product lines with [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] and [[Barney & Friends|Barney]].  Thus, US sales were stagnant in the early 1990s, falling from 1993 to 1995. To turn domestic performance around in 1994, Hasbro merged the Hasbro Toy, Playskool, Playskool Baby, Kenner, and Kid Dimension units into the Hasbro Toy Group.  Meanwhile, Mattel purchased [[Fisher-Price]] and retook the top spot in the toy industry.<ref name=idch/>\n\n[[Hasbro Interactive]] was started in 1995 and released the Monopoly game on CD-ROM.  Mattel also proposed a merger that year, but was turned down by the Hasbro board in 1996 due to antitrust issues and Justice Department investigation into exclusionary policies between toy manufacturers and toy retailers, particularly [[Toys \"R\" Us]].<ref name=idch/>\n\nIn 1998, Hasbro bought [[Avalon Hill]] for $6 million<ref>{{cite news|last=Leffall |first=J.|title=Monarch Avalon to sell game unit to Hasbro In wake of loss, local company to get $6 million in cash|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-08-05/business/1998217009_1_avalon-hasbro-monarch-services|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=August 5, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=L. de Rosa|first1=Peter|title=The Fall of Avalon Hill|journal=Academic Gaming Review|date=Summer 2002|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~pdr4455/fah.html|accessdate=June 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129025756/http://home.earthlink.net/~pdr4455/fah.html|archive-date=January 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Galoob]] for $220 million.<ref name=\"hasbrosale\">Fost, Dan.[http://articles.sfgate.com/1998-09-29/business/17730903_1_hasbro-galoob-star-wars-lucasfilm Hasbro Adds Galoob to Its Toy Chest].\" ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.

Now Hasbro develops video games based on its brands through third-party developers and licensing strategies, notably with major American companies such as [[Activision]], [[Electronic Arts]], and [[THQ]]. Following the rise of [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet PCs]] in the 2010s, as well as major video gaming publishers cutting back on releasing games based on licensed IPs for various reasons, such as [[Great Recession|economic slumps]], several of Hasbro's brands were licensed towards mobile game developers such as [[Gameloft]], releasing their games under the label Hasbro Gaming.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, Hasbro announced that it would be introducing a musical [[toothbrush]] to the market. The ''[[Tooth Tunes]]'', released in early 2007, transmits music from the [[Human mandible|jawbone]] to the ear when the bristles touch the teeth.\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\nIn 2007, a workers' rights group investigated several of Hasbro's Chinese suppliers and found that, in one instance, a toy factory in China's [[Guangxi Province]] had hired 1000 [[junior high school]] students. The same group discovered other widespread [[Labour law|labor violations]], including unsafe working conditions, mandatory overtime, [[verbal abuse]] and [[sexual harassment]] of employees. Hasbro issued a statement, saying that it would \"act swiftly and decisively in making any necessary changes\" and had \"increased the intensity of [its] ongoing safety review efforts.\" Critics pointed out that Hasbro had no official regulatory control of these factories. Hasbro responded by hiring independent auditors. These auditors make unannounced visits to the [[East Asian]] subcontractors. Factory managers have been coached in how to fool the auditors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/business/worldbusiness/22factory.html?ref=business \"U.S. Group Accuses Chinese Toy Factories of Labor Abuses\"] from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nHasbro has also been criticized for focusing some of its products on specific demographic groups. For example, a letter spread widely on [[social media]] in November 2012 written by a six-year-old Irish girl complaining about the lack of female characters in the guessing game ''[[Guess Who?]]''<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/guess-whos-sexist-classic-board-games-gender-bias-leaves-sixyearold-fuming-8324067.html \"Guess Who's sexist?

As such, there have been criticisms that Hasbro's toys reinforce [[gender stereotypes]]. For example, in December 2012, 13-year-old McKenna Pope started a campaign on [[Change.org]], calling on the company to create a \"boy-friendly\" version of the popular [[Easy-Bake Oven]] and to feature boys on their packaging and materials.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/teen-starts-campaign-gender-neutral-easy-bake-oven-155338662--abc-news-topstories.html \"Teen starts campaign for gender neutral Easy Bake Oven\"] from ''[[Good Morning America]]''</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">[https://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/04/business/la-fi-easy-bake-20121204 \"Teen girl petitions Hasbro to market Easy Bake Oven also to boys\"] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> Within a week, over 30,000 people signed her petition.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/living/gender-toy-marketing-petition/?hpt=hp_c2|title=Teen says pink toy ovens discourage boys from kitchen play|author=Emanuella Grinberg, CNN|date=December 6, 2012|work=CNN}}</ref>\n\nHasbro was criticized for \"sexist\" product design when its 2015 [[Star Wars]] [[Monopoly board game]] failed to feature [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the female protagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', while including all of the supporting male characters.

The significant action of the first week in relation to the overall classification was restricted to a split in the field on stage 3, and a team time trial the following day.\n\nThe second weekend saw the Tour in the [[Pyrenees]], and the first attack on the field by eventual winner [[Alberto Contador]], while the leadership was taken over by [[Rinaldo Nocentini]]. [[Thor Hushovd]] showed an ability to take points in stages that did not include flat sprint finishes that would be key to the contest for the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], and the main contenders for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] emerged. The journey towards the [[Alps]] the following week had a second pair of successive stage wins for Cavendish and a series of wins from riders in breakaways that held no threat to the general classification. An infringement in the sprint finish to stage 14 saw Cavendish relegated in finishing position, and Hushovd gaining the upper hand in the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]].\n\nThe first alpine stage was the occasion of Contador's assumption of the race leadership, and the emergence of [[Andy Schleck]] as the only rider likely to challenge him in the mountains, and as the top young rider, giving Schleck the right to wear the white jersey. [[Franco Pellizotti]] focussed on collecting points on the climbs early in stages to overhaul [[Egoi Mart\u00ednez]] in the race for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], without threatening the race leaders. By the end of the three stages in the Alps, and after Contador's victory in the final time trial, it was only the minor placings that were realistically under question in the last mountain stage, held for the first time on the penultimate day of the tour on [[Mont Ventoux]].\n\nThe [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] introduced a ban on radio communication between team management and riders on stage 10, but the riders responded with a conservative style of racing for most of the stage and the intended repetition of the experiment on stage 13 was abandoned.<ref>{{cite news\n |url         = https://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourearpieces_brief\n |title       = Cycling-UCI lift earpieces ban for Tour 13th stage\n |date        = 18 June 2009\n |publisher   = yahoo.com\n |accessdate  = 30 June 2009\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5j5MqtJum?url=http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourearpieces_brief\n |archivedate = 17 August 2009\n |url-status     = live\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Mark Cavendish]] climed his sixth [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in the Tour de France|Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage]] win on the final day of the Tour.<ref name=\"cn-stage-21\">{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Anthony|title=Cavendish celebrates with number six on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-21/results/|access-date=17 February 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|date=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216230800/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-21/results/|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the victory ceremony, the [[national anthem of Denmark]] was mistakenly played instead of that of [[Marcha Real|Spain]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Danish anthem played for Spanish winner Contador|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/26/us-cycling-tour-anthem-sb-idUSTRE56P28B20090726|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031718/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/26/us-cycling-tour-anthem-sb-idUSTRE56P28B20090726|archive-date=21 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> At the victory ceremony for teams, the anthem of Spain was yet played, because Contador was part of the winning team, Astana.\n\n===Doping===\nIn the 2009 Tour, Doping controls were conducted by the UCI, with the French body AFLD shadowing the process.

The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=44}} There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=45\u201346}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=39}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=44}} The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=44}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=44\u201345}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1984.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=45}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=45}} The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each [[mass start]] stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=45}} The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Franco Pellizotti was given the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=100}}{{efn|name=pellizotti-note}}\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of \u20ac5000, the [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]], given in honour of Tour founder and first race race director [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Great St Bernard Pass|Col du Grand-Saint-Bernard]] on stage 16, and the [[Souvenir Jacques Goddet]], given in honour of the second director [[Jacques Goddet]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 9.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=28}} Franco Pellizotti won both the Henri Desgrange and the Jacques Goddet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Anthony|title=Astarloza top dog in Bourg-Saint-Maurice|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-16/results/|access-date=2 March 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|date=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216231408/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-16/results/|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Anthony|last2=Clarke|first2=Les|title=Fedrigo claims another stage for France|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-9/results/|access-date=4 March 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|date=12 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216233421/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-9/results/|archive-date=2018-02-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour de France 2009 \u2013 Leaders overview|url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2009/gc/stages/leaders-overview|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=16 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216221815/https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2009/gc/stages/leaders-overview|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 2009|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 2009|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302052745/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2009|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n!

The significant action of the first week in relation to the overall classification was restricted to a split in the field on stage 3, and a team time trial the following day.\n\nThe second weekend saw the Tour in the [[Pyrenees]], and the first attack on the field by eventual winner [[Alberto Contador]], while the leadership was taken over by [[Rinaldo Nocentini]]. [[Thor Hushovd]] showed an ability to take points in stages that did not include flat sprint finishes that would be key to the contest for the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], and the main contenders for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] emerged. The journey towards the [[Alps]] the following week had a second pair of successive stage wins for Cavendish and a series of wins from riders in breakaways that held no threat to the general classification. An infringement in the sprint finish to stage 14 saw Cavendish relegated in finishing position, and Hushovd gaining the upper hand in the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]].\n\nThe first alpine stage was the occasion of Contador's assumption of the race leadership, and the emergence of [[Andy Schleck]] as the only rider likely to challenge him in the mountains, and as the top young rider, giving Schleck the right to wear the white jersey. [[Franco Pellizotti]] focussed on collecting points on the climbs early in stages to overhaul [[Egoi Mart\u00ednez]] in the race for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], without threatening the race leaders. By the end of the three stages in the Alps, and after Contador's victory in the final time trial, it was only the minor placings that were realistically under question in the last mountain stage, held for the first time on the penultimate day of the tour on [[Mont Ventoux]].\n\nThe [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] introduced a ban on radio communication between team management and riders on stage 10, but the riders responded with a conservative style of racing for most of the stage and the intended repetition of the experiment on stage 13 was abandoned.<ref>{{cite news\n |url         = https://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourearpieces_brief\n |title       = Cycling-UCI lift earpieces ban for Tour 13th stage\n |date        = 18 June 2009\n |publisher   = yahoo.com\n |accessdate  = 30 June 2009\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/5j5MqtJum?url=http://sports.yahoo.com/sc/news?slug=reu-tourearpieces_brief\n |archivedate = 17 August 2009\n |url-status     = live\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Mark Cavendish]] climed his sixth [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage in the Tour de France|Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es stage]] win on the final day of the Tour.<ref name=\"cn-stage-21\">{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Anthony|title=Cavendish celebrates with number six on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-21/results/|access-date=17 February 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|date=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216230800/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-21/results/|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the victory ceremony, the [[national anthem of Denmark]] was mistakenly played instead of that of [[Marcha Real|Spain]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Danish anthem played for Spanish winner Contador|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/26/us-cycling-tour-anthem-sb-idUSTRE56P28B20090726|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521031718/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/26/us-cycling-tour-anthem-sb-idUSTRE56P28B20090726|archive-date=21 May 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> At the victory ceremony for teams, the anthem of Spain was yet played, because Contador was part of the winning team, Astana.\n\n===Doping===\nIn the 2009 Tour, Doping controls were conducted by the UCI, with the French body AFLD shadowing the process.

The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=44}} There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=45\u201346}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=39}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=44}} The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=44}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=44\u201345}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1984.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=45}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=45}} The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each [[mass start]] stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=45}} The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|pp=35\u201336}} At the conclusion of the Tour, Franco Pellizotti was given the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=100}}{{efn|name=pellizotti}}\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of \u20ac5000, the [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]], given in honour of Tour founder and first race race director [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Great St Bernard Pass|Col du Grand-Saint-Bernard]] on stage 16, and the [[Souvenir Jacques Goddet]], given in honour of the second director [[Jacques Goddet]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 9.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2009|p=28}} Franco Pellizotti won both the Henri Desgrange and the Jacques Goddet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Anthony|title=Astarloza top dog in Bourg-Saint-Maurice|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-16/results/|access-date=2 March 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|date=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216231408/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-16/results/|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Anthony|last2=Clarke|first2=Les|title=Fedrigo claims another stage for France|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-9/results/|access-date=4 March 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|date=12 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216233421/http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2009/stage-9/results/|archive-date=2018-02-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour de France 2009 \u2013 Leaders overview|url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2009/gc/stages/leaders-overview|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=16 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216221815/https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2009/gc/stages/leaders-overview|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 2009|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 2009|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302052745/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2009|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n!

[[Alberto Contador]] was placed second at the time in the green jersey points classification, but was the leader in the king of the mountains classification, and so forfeited the right to wear the green jersey. As a result, the third placed rider in the opening time trial, [[Bradley Wiggins]] wore the green jersey on stage 2.<ref>{{cite web\n

There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Besides affecting the European rabbit, RHDV-2 has caused disease in Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDVa first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]].

By the late 1990s, RHDVa stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDVa in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

This was backed up in an early August review of the decision by the Director-General of Agriculture. However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up. Ten years on, rabbit populations (in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] in particular) are beginning to reach near pre-plague proportions once again though they have not yet returned to pre RCD levels.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Munro|editor1-first=Robert K. |editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=Richard T. |title=Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease: Issues in Assessment for biological control |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau of Resource Sciences |location=Canberra |isbn=9780644335126}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 1080 drops in MacKenzie Basin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/2441711/Mackenzie-1080-drop-plan |last=Williams |first=David |date=26 May 2009 |newspaper= The Press |accessdate = 2009-06-14}}</ref>\n\nResistance to RHD in New Zealand rabbits has led to the widespread use of [[1080 usage in New Zealand|Compound 1080 (Sodium fluoroacetate)]].

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.
