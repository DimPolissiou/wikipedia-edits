Annunziata.jpg|thumb|''Madonna of the Rosary'', by Agostino Ciampelli]]\n[[Image:Annunciazione Chiesa degli Ottimati.jpg|thumb|''Annunciation'', by Agostino Ciampelli]]\n''' Agostino Ciampelli ''' (29 August 1565 \u2013 22 April 1630)  was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter of the [[Baroque]] period. He trained with [[Santi di Tito]] in [[Florence]], and painted in Rome under [[Clement VIII]], including a ''Crucifixion''  for [[Santa Prassede]] and a ''Saint Giovanni Gualberto'' in its sacristy; ''Angels'' on the walls above the choirstalls in the apse of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]];  frescoes of the ''Stoning of Saint Vitale'' in [[Basilica of San Vitale (Rome)|San Vitale]] and further frescoes in the little church of Santa Bibiena; and ''The Visitation'' in Sant Stefano di Pescia. At the [[Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano]], Ciampelli frescoed the walls of the canons' sacristy, the \"Sala Clementina\".\n\n==Life==\n\n===Florence and Rome===\nAgostino Ciampelli was born in [[Florence]]. There is little known about his early childhood. Agostino trained in the studio of [[Santi di Tito]], a leading artists of the [[Counter Reformation]].\n\nAgostino was admitted into the [[Accademia del Disegno]] in Florence in 1585. Some of his earliest known works include paintings for a temporary triumphal arch at the entry of [[Christina of Lorraine]] into Florence in 1589. These paintings were constructed by Santi and his pupils.\n\nIn Florence, Agostino he frescoed a ''Story of [[Esther]] and [[Ahasuerus]]'' in the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]]. Agostino also worked with [[Andrea Commodi]] at the Gesu, painting scenes from the life of [[Ignatius]] that would later adorn Commodi\u2019s tomb in 1605.\n\n\nAgostino traveled to [[Rome]] during the papacy of [[Clement VIII]]. There Agostino painted ''Crucifixion'' for Santa Prassede, angels on the walls of the [[apse]] of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and a ''Visitation'' in Santo Stefano di Pescia. He also painted a ''Nativity of the Virgin'' in [[San Michelino Visdomini]] in Florence, and a fresco cycle of [[Old Testament]] themes for the [[Palazzo Corsini, Rome|Palazzo Corsini]]. He also painted the Chapel of St. Andrew in the [[Church of the Gesu]] in Rome, representing ''The Martydom of St Stephen'' on the walls; on the vault ''The Glory of the Virgin Surrounded by Holy Martyrs''; and for the altarpiece, ''The Martyrdom of St Andrew''.\n\n==Influences==\n[[Santi di Tito]] was a major influence to Agostino, impacting his style and assisting him in acquiring his skills. Another major role in Agostino\u2019s life was [[Alessandro de Medici]]. Alessandro was the most important [[patron]] and protector to Agostino. Alessandro took Agostino to Rome in 1594 after Agostino went through schooling from 1590 to 1594 at [[Florentine Academy]] in Florence where he stayed until 1630.\n\nMany works were produced with Alessandro and can be found in his titular church of [[Santa Prassede]] and at [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]] in [[Trastevere]].\n\n==Paintings==\nAgostino produced many pieces of artwork in Italy. Two of his paintings that he is well known for are ''Two Angels Facing Right'' and ''Two Angels Facing Left''. These bright, vivid panels of [[angels]] were done with oil [[pastels]] and done around 1600. These paintings formed a now-lost painting or [[altarpiece]]. The elegance of these paintings shows the continuing influence of Santi di Tito and may be compared with such paintings as a ''[[Christ]] Appearing to Saint Martin of Tours'' in the church of Santa Maria del Pianto in Rome, which was one of the few commissions awarded to Ciampelli by [[Pope Leo XI]]. Similar angels appear in a number of Ciampello\u2019s paintings, such as ''The Death of Saint Anthony Abbot'' which was created in 1612 displayed in the church of [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini]] in Rome. The facial types of the angels may also be compared with the figures of ''The [[Baptism]] of Christ'' done by Ciampelli, which was formally in the [[Palazzo Corsini, Florence|Palazzo Corsini]] in Florence.\n\nOther paintings produced by Agostino are the Madonna of the ''[[Rosary]]'' and the ''[[Annunciation]]'' done in oil pastels and both executed around 1600.\n\n==Other works==\nCiampelli was also known for using other mediums in his artwork. A very well known drawing of his is ''The [[Stoning]] of St. Stephen'' which was produced with pen and ink with [[chalk]] and was executed when Ciampelli was in [[Florence]] around the 1580s. This drawing is a great example of how Ciampelli\u2019s artwork was simple and direct religious art.\n\nCiampelli also constructed [[lunettes]], one of them being a decoration for a [[chapel]]. The lunette consists of angels making music and carrying the symbols of the [[Immaculate Conception]] along with angels on the side. The medium used to create this was pen, ink, and wash with chalk and was created in Rome around 1615.\n\n==References==\n<!--===Secondary sources===-->\n*{{cite book | first= Maria|last= Farquhar| year=1855| title= Biographical catalogue of the principal Italian painters|  editor = Ralph Nicholson Wornum | pages= 46| publisher=  Woodfall & Kinder, Angel Court, Skinner Street, London; Digitized by Googlebooks from Oxford University copy on Jun 27, 2006| id= | url= https://books.google.com/books?q=intitle:Wornum+intitle:principal+intitle:painters | authorlink= }}\n*Touring Club Italiano, ''Roma e Dintorni''.(Milan) 1965.\n<!--===Secondary sources===-->\n*\"Artnet.\" Agostino Ciampelli. 2009.

For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question \"how should I ''be''\u201d rather than \"what should I ''do''.\u201d A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy.

He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness.\n\nIn his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the \"[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]].\" The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>Crisp, Roger. \"Hedonism Reconsidered\".

Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \"Utility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman\".

Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>Sridharan, Vishnu. \"Utility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman\".

It must cope with the external environment, which can vary in a wide range as the spacecraft is exposed to deep space or to solar or planetary flux, and with ejecting to space the internal heat generated by the operation of the spacecraft itself.\n\nThermal control is essential to guarantee the optimum performance and success of the mission because if a component is subjected to temperatures which are too high or too low, it could be damaged or its performance could be severely affected. Thermal control is also necessary to keep specific components (such as optical sensors, atomic clocks, etc.) within a specified temperature stability requirement, to ensure that they perform as efficiently as possible. \n \nThe thermal control subsystem can be composed both of passive and of active items and works in two ways:\n* protects the equipment from overheating, either by thermal insulation from external heat fluxes (such as the Sun or the planetary infrared and albedo flux), or by proper heat removal from internal sources (such as the heat emitted by the internal electronic equipment). \n* protects the equipment from temperatures that are too cold, by thermal insulation from external sinks, by enhanced heat absorption from external sources, or by heat release from internal sources.\n'''Passive Thermal Control System''' ('''PTCS''') components include:\n* [[Multi-layer insulation]] (MLI), which protects the spacecraft from excessive solar or planetary heating as well as from excessive cooling when exposed to deep space\n* coatings that change the thermo-optical properties of external surfaces\n* thermal fillers to improve the thermal coupling at selected interfaces (for instance on the thermal path between an electronic unit and its radiator)\n* thermal washers to reduce the thermal coupling at selected interfaces\n* thermal doublers to spread on the radiator surface the heat dissipated by equipment\n* mirrors (secondary surface mirrors, SSM, or optical solar reflectors, OSR) to improve the heat rejection capability of the external radiators and at the same time to reduce the absorption of external solar fluxes\n* [[radioisotope heater unit]]s (RHU), used by some planetary and exploratory missions to produce heat for TCS purposes\n'''Active Thermal Control System''' ('''ATCS''') components include:\n* thermostatically controlled resistive electric heaters to keep the equipment temperature above its lower limit during the mission's cold phases\n* fluid loops to transfer the heat emitted by equipment to the radiators.

Either the surfaces need to be protected from the environment or there has to be improved interaction. Two main goals of environment interaction are the reduction or increase of absorbed environmental fluxes and reduction or increase of heat losses to the environment. \n*Heat collection \n**Includes the removal of dissipated heat from the equipment in which it is created to avoid unwanted increases in the spacecraft's temperature. \n*Heat transport \n**Is taking the heat from where it is created to a radiating device. \n*Heat rejection \n**The heat collected and transported has to be rejected at an appropriate temperature to a heat sink, which is usually the surrounding space environment. The rejection temperature depends on the amount of heat involved, the temperature to be controlled and the temperature of the environment into which the device radiates the heat.\n*Heat provision and storage.\n**Is to maintain a desired temperature level where heat has to be provided and suitable heat storage capability has to be foreseen.\n\n== Environment ==\nFor a spacecraft the main environmental interactions are the energy coming from the sun and the heat radiated to deep space. Other parameters also influence the thermal control system design such as the spacecraft's altitude, orbit, attitude stabilization, and spacecraft shape. Different types of orbit, such as low earth orbit and geostationary orbit, also affect the design of the thermal control system. \n*Low Earth Orbit (LEO)\n**This orbit is frequently used by spacecraft that monitor or measure the characteristics of the Earth and its surrounding environment and by unmanned and manned space laboratories, such as [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] and the International Space Station. The orbit's proximity to the Earth has a great influence on the thermal control system needs, with the Earth's infrared emission and albedo playing a very important role, as well as the relatively short orbital period, less than 2 hours, and long eclipse duration. Small instruments or spacecraft appendages such as solar panels that have low thermal inertia can be seriously affected by this continuously changing environment and may require very specific thermal design solutions.\n*Geostationary orbit (GEO)\n**In this 24-hour orbit, the Earth's influence is almost negligible except for the shadowing during eclipses, which can vary in duration from zero at solstice to a maximum of 1.2 hours at equinox. Long eclipses influence the design of both the spacecraft's insulation and heating systems. The seasonal variations in the direction and intensity of the solar input have a great impact on the design, complicating the heat transport by the need to convey most of the dissipated heat to the radiator in shadow, and the heat-rejection systems via the increased radiator area needed. Almost all telecommunications and many meteorological satellites are in this type of orbit.\n*Highly Eccentric Orbits (HEO)\n**These orbits can have a wide range of apogee and perigee altitudes, depending on the particular mission. Generally, they are used for astronomy observatories and the TCS design requirements depend on the spacecraft's orbital period, the number and duration of the eclipses, the relative attitude of Earth, Sun and spacecraft, the type of instruments onboard and their individual temperature requirements.\n*Deep space and planetary exploration\n**An interplanetary trajectory exposes spacecrafts to a wide range of thermal environment more severe than those encountered around earth's orbits. Interplanetary mission includes many different sub-scenarios depending on the particular celestial body. In general, the common features are a long mission duration and the need to cope with extreme thermal conditions, such as cruises either close to or far away from the Sun (from 1 to 4\u20135 AU), low orbiting of very cold or very hot celestial bodies, descents through hostile atmospheres, and survival in the extreme (dusty, icy) environments on the surfaces of the bodies visited. The challenge for the TCS is to provide enough heat-rejection capability during the hot operating phases and yet still survive the cold inactive ones. The major problem is often the provision of the power required for that survival phase.\n\n==Temperature Requirements==\nThe temperature requirements of the instruments and equipment on board are the main factors in the design of the thermal control system. The goal of the TCS is to keep all the instruments working within their allowable temperature range. All of the electronic instruments on board the spacecraft, such as cameras, data collection devices, batteries, etc., have a fixed operating temperature range. Keeping these instruments in their optimal operational temperature range is crucial for every mission. Some examples of temperature ranges include\n*Batteries, which have a very narrow operating range, typically between \u22125 and 20\u02daC\n*Propulsion components, which have a typical range of 5 to 40\u02daC for safety reasons, however, a wider range is acceptable\n*Cameras, which have a range of \u221230 to 40\u02daC\n*Solar arrays, which have a wide operating range of \u2212150 to 100\u02daC\n*Infrared spectrometers, which have a range of \u221240 to 60\u02daC\n\n==Current Technologies==\n\n===Coating===\nCoatings are the simplest and least expensive of the TCS techniques. A coating may be paint or a more sophisticated chemical applied to the surfaces of the spacecraft to lower or increase heat transfer. The characteristics of the type of coating depends on their absorptivity, emissivity, transparency, and reflectivity. The main disadvantage of coating is that it degrades quickly due to the operating environment.\n\n===Multilayer Insulation (MLI)===\nMultilayer insulation (MLI) is the most common passive thermal control element used on spacecrafts. MLI prevent both heat losses to the environment and excessive heating from the environment. Spacecraft components such as propellant tanks, propellant lines, batteries, and solid rocket motors are also covered in MLI blankets to maintain ideal operating temperature. MLI consist of an outer cover layer, interior layer, and an inner cover layer. The outer cover layer needs to be opaque to sunlight, generate a low amount of particulate contaminates, and be able to survive in the environment and temperature to which the spacecraft will be exposed. Some common materials used for the outer layer are fiberglass woven cloth impregnated with [[PTFE]] Teflon, [[Polyvinyl flouride|PVF]] reinforced with [[Nomex]] bonded with polyester adhesive, and [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]] Teflon. The general requirement for the interior layer is that it needs to have a low emittance. The most commonly used material for this layer is Mylar that is aluminized on one or both sides. The interior layers are usually thin compared to the outer layer to save weight and are perforated to aid in venting trapped air during launch. The inner cover faces the spacecraft hardware and is used to protect the thin interior layers. Inner covers are often not aluminized in order to prevent electrical shorts. Some materials used for the inner covers are [[Polyethylene terephthalate|Dacron]] and Nomex Netting. Mylar is not used because of flammability concerns. MLI blankets are an important element of the thermal control system.\n\n===Louvers===\nLouvers are active thermal control elements that are used in many different forms. Most commonly they are placed over external radiators, louvers can also be used to control heat transfer between internal spacecraft surfaces, or be placed on openings on the spacecraft walls. A louver in its fully open state can reject six times as much heat as it does in its fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. The most commonly used louver is the bimetallic, spring-actuated, rectangular blade louver also known as venetian-blind louver. Louver radiator assemblies consist of five main elements: baseplate, blades, actuators, sensing elements, and structural elements.\n\n===Heaters===\nHeaters are used in thermal control design to protect components under cold-case environmental conditions or to make up for heat that is not dissipated. Heaters are used with thermostats or solid-state controllers to provide exact temperature control of a particular component. Another common use for heaters is to warm up components to their minimum operating temperatures before the components are turned on. \n*The most common type of heater used on spacecraft is the patch heater which consists of an electrical-resistance element sandwiched between two sheets of flexible electrically insulating material, such as [[Kapton]]. The patch heater may contain either a single circuit or multiple circuits, depending on whether or not redundancy is required within it.\n*Another type of heater, the [[cartridge heater]], is often used to heat blocks of material or high-temperature components such as propellants. This heater consists of a coiled resistor enclosed in a cylindrical metallic case. Typically a hole is drilled in the component to be heated and the cartridge is potted into the hole. Cartridge heaters are usually a quarter-inch or less in diameter and up to a few inches long. \n*Another type of heater used on spacecraft is the radioisotope heater units also known as RHUs. RHUs are used for traveling to outer planets past Jupiter due to very low solar radiance, which greatly reduces the power generated from solar panels. These heaters do not require any electrical power from the spacecraft and provide direct heat where it is needed. At the center of each RHU is a radioactive material which decays to provide heat. The most commonly used material is plutonium-dioxide. A single RHU weighs just 42 grams and can fit in a cylindrical enclosure 26mm in diameter and 32mm long. Each unit also generates 1 W of heat at encapsulation however the heat generation rate decreases with time. A total of 117 RHUs were used on the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] mission.\n\n=== Radiators ===\nExcess waste heat created on the spacecraft is rejected to space by the use of radiators. Radiators come in several different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted to the side of the spacecraft, and panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by infrared (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat and any radiant-heat loads from the environment. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorptance to limit heat from the sun. Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 W of internally generated electronics waste heat per square meter. Radiators weight typically varies from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around 12&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for a heavy deployable radiator and its support structure.\n\nThe radiators of the International Space Station are clearly visible as arrays of white square panels attached to the main truss.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url   = https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/radiators.html#.VgcSEMtVhBc\n| title = Radiators\n| work  = International Space Station\n| publisher  = [[NASA]]\n| accessdate = September 26, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n===Heat pipes===\n[[Heat pipe]]s use a closed two-phase liquid-flow cycle with an evaporator and a condenser to transport relatively large quantities of heat from one location to another without electrical power.\n\n==Future of Thermal Control Systems==\n*Composite materials\n*Heat rejection through Advanced Passive Radiators\n*Spray cooling devices (e.g. [[liquid droplet radiator]])\n*Lightweight thermal insulation \n*Variable-emittance technologies\n*Diamond films\n*Advanced thermal control coatings\n**Microsheets\n**Advanced spray on thin films\n**Silvered quartz mirrors\n**Advanced metallized polymer-based films\n\n== Events ==\nA major event in the field of space thermal control is the [[International Conference on Environmental Systems]], organized every year by [[AIAA]].\n\n==Sun shield==\n[[File:James Webb telescope sunshield.jpg|thumb|Sunshield full-size test for the James Webb Space Telescope]]\nIn spacecraft design, a sun shield restricts or reduces heat caused by sunlight hitting a spacecraft.<ref>[http://pages.erau.edu/~ericksol/courses/sp300/ch10/thermal_ch10.html]</ref> An example of use of a thermal shield is on the [[Infrared Space Observatory]].<ref>[http://pages.erau.edu/~ericksol/courses/sp300/ch10/thermal_ch10.html]</ref> The ISO sunshield helped protect the cryostat from sunlight, and it was also covered with solar panels.<ref>[http://general-tools.cosmos.esa.int/iso/images/misc/m3085_is.jpg]</ref>\n\nNot to be confused with concept of a  global scale sun shield in [[Geological engineering|geoengineering]], often called a [[Space sunshade]] or \"sun shield\", in that case the spacecraft itself is used to block sunlight on a planet, not as part the spacecraft's thermal design.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming]</ref>\n\nAn example of a sunshield in spacecraft design is the [[Sunshield (JWST)]] on the planned [[James Webb Space Telescope]].<ref>[http://jwst.nasa.gov/sunshield.html]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Life support system|Environmental Control and Life Support System]]\n* [[Space sunshade]]\n* [[Temperature control]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Gilmore, D.G., \u201cSatellite Thermal Control Handbook\u201d, The Aerospace Corporation Press, 1994.\n* Karam, R.D., Satellite Thermal Control for Systems Engineers, Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, [[AIAA]], 1998.\n* Gilmore, D.G., \u201cSpacecraft Thermal Control Handbook 2nd ed.\u201d, The Aerospace Corporation Press, 2002.\n* De Parolis, M.N., and W.

The general requirement for the interior layer is that it needs to have a low emittance. The most commonly used material for this layer is Mylar that is aluminized on one or both sides. The interior layers are usually thin compared to the outer layer to save weight and are perforated to aid in venting trapped air during launch. The inner cover faces the spacecraft hardware and is used to protect the thin interior layers. Inner covers are often not aluminized in order to prevent electrical shorts. Some materials used for the inner covers are [[Polyethylene terephthalate|Dacron]] and Nomex Netting. Mylar is not used because of flammability concerns. MLI blankets are an important element of the thermal control system.\n\n===Louvers===\nLouvers are active thermal control elements that are used in many different forms. Most commonly they are placed over external radiators, louvers can also be used to control heat transfer between internal spacecraft surfaces, or be placed on openings on the spacecraft walls. A louver in its fully open state can reject six times as much heat as it does in its fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. The most commonly used louver is the bimetallic, spring-actuated, rectangular blade louver also known as venetian-blind louver. Louver radiator assemblies consist of five main elements: baseplate, blades, actuators, sensing elements, and structural elements.\n\n===Heaters===\nHeaters are used in thermal control design to protect components under cold-case environmental conditions or to make up for heat that is not dissipated. Heaters are used with thermostats or solid-state controllers to provide exact temperature control of a particular component. Another common use for heaters is to warm up components to their minimum operating temperatures before the components are turned on. \n*The most common type of heater used on spacecraft is the patch heater which consists of an electrical-resistance element sandwiched between two sheets of flexible electrically insulating material, such as [[Kapton]]. The patch heater may contain either a single circuit or multiple circuits, depending on whether or not redundancy is required within it.\n*Another type of heater, the [[cartridge heater]], is often used to heat blocks of material or high-temperature components such as propellants. This heater consists of a coiled resistor enclosed in a cylindrical metallic case. Typically a hole is drilled in the component to be heated and the cartridge is potted into the hole. Cartridge heaters are usually a quarter-inch or less in diameter and up to a few inches long. \n*Another type of heater used on spacecraft is the radioisotope heater units also known as RHUs. RHUs are used for traveling to outer planets past Jupiter due to very low solar radiance, which greatly reduces the power generated from solar panels. These heaters do not require any electrical power from the spacecraft and provide direct heat where it is needed. At the center of each RHU is a radioactive material which decays to provide heat. The most commonly used material is plutonium-dioxide. A single RHU weighs just 42 grams and can fit in a cylindrical enclosure 26mm in diameter and 32mm long. Each unit also generates 1 W of heat at encapsulation however the heat generation rate decreases with time. A total of 117 RHUs were used on the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] mission.\n\n=== Radiators ===\nExcess waste heat created on the spacecraft is rejected to space by the use of radiators. Radiators come in several different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted to the side of the spacecraft, and panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by infrared (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat and any radiant-heat loads from the environment. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorptance to limit heat from the sun. Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 W of internally generated electronics waste heat per square meter. Radiators weight typically varies from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around 12&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for a heavy deployable radiator and its support structure.\n\nThe radiators of the International Space Station are clearly visible as arrays of white square panels attached to the main truss.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url   = https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/radiators.html#.VgcSEMtVhBc\n| title = Radiators\n| work  = International Space Station\n| publisher  = [[NASA]]\n| accessdate = September 26, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n===Heat pipes===\n[[Heat pipe]]s use a closed two-phase liquid-flow cycle with an evaporator and a condenser to transport relatively large quantities of heat from one location to another without electrical power.\n\n==Future of Thermal Control Systems==\n*Composite materials\n*Heat rejection through Advanced Passive Radiators\n*Spray cooling devices (e.g. [[liquid droplet radiator]])\n*Lightweight thermal insulation \n*Variable-emittance technologies\n*Diamond films\n*Advanced thermal control coatings\n**Microsheets\n**Advanced spray on thin films\n**Silvered quartz mirrors\n**Advanced metallized polymer-based films\n\n== Events ==\nA major event in the field of space thermal control is the [[International Conference on Environmental Systems]], organized every year by [[AIAA]].\n\n==Sun shield==\n[[File:James Webb telescope sunshield.jpg|thumb|Sunshield full-size test for the James Webb Space Telescope]]\nIn spacecraft design, a sun shield restricts or reduces heat caused by sunlight hitting a spacecraft.<ref>[http://pages.erau.edu/~ericksol/courses/sp300/ch10/thermal_ch10.html]</ref> An example of use of a thermal shield is on the [[Infrared Space Observatory]].<ref>[http://pages.erau.edu/~ericksol/courses/sp300/ch10/thermal_ch10.html]</ref> The ISO sunshield helped protect the cryostat from sunlight, and it was also covered with solar panels.<ref>[http://general-tools.cosmos.esa.int/iso/images/misc/m3085_is.jpg]</ref>\n\nNot to be confused with concept of a  global scale sun shield in [[Geological engineering|geoengineering]], often called a [[Space sunshade]] or \"sun shield\", in that case the spacecraft itself is used to block sunlight on a planet, not as part the spacecraft's thermal design.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming]</ref>\n\nAn example of a sunshield in spacecraft design is the [[Sunshield (JWST)]] on the planned [[James Webb Space Telescope]].<ref>[http://jwst.nasa.gov/sunshield.html]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Life support system|Environmental Control and Life Support System]]\n* [[Space sunshade]]\n* [[Temperature control]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Gilmore, D.G., \u201cSatellite Thermal Control Handbook\u201d, The Aerospace Corporation Press, 1994.\n* Karam, R.D., Satellite Thermal Control for Systems Engineers, Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics, [[AIAA]], 1998.\n* Gilmore, D.G., \u201cSpacecraft Thermal Control Handbook 2nd ed.\u201d, The Aerospace Corporation Press, 2002.\n* De Parolis, M.N., and W.

It can be considered as an essential work of his [[tintinnabuli]] style.\n\n== History of composition ==\n''F\u00fcr Alina'' was first performed in [[Tallinn]] in 1976, along with six other works, after a long preparatory period in P\u00e4rt's life as a composer. This concert was the first to introduce his new signature style of composition, referred to as the tintinnabuli style.\n\nThe title echoes Beethoven's piece for solo piano ''[[F\u00fcr Elise]]''. While the identity of the dedicatee of Beethoven's work is unclear, ''F\u00fcr Alina'' was dedicated to a family friend's eighteen-year-old daughter. The family had broken up and the daughter went to England with her father. The work, dedicated to the daughter, was actually meant as a work of consolation for the girl's mother, missing her child. Its introspection calls to mind a vivid image of youth, off to explore the world.\n\n== Musical structure ==\n{{tone|section|date=March 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\n{{original research|section|date=December 2017}}\nThe piece appears very simple on the page. The score of ''F\u00fcr Alina'' is only two pages long. It is in the key of [[B minor]] and is played ''piano (p)''. The only [[Musical notation|notation]] related to tempo is ''Ruhig, erhaben, in sich hineinhorchend'', which roughly translates as ''peacefully, in an elevated and introspective manner.''{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} There is no [[time signature]].

[[Private Passions]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs notated, it could be played by a musician at beginner level. It has both the left and right hand written in [[G clef]] and only the echoing bass [[octave]] is written in [[F clef]]. Its simplicity is deceptive: it leaves a lot to the performer.\nTo achieve purity of sound remains a challenge and demands an accomplished pianist with a good ear to produce the harmonic balance and symmetry the composition requires. It is common to repeat the composition several times. Variations could also be applied from one repetition to the other, like the exact 8ava of the two (melody) hands (stead for the length of each full repetition).\n\nIt begins with a low [[Double octave|double-octave]] B, which echoes throughout the whole work (save for the last section); it should be played with the pedal down throughout (a single pedal shift is found before the last four bars). The right hand plays the notes an octave higher than noted. Considering there is no time signature, the tempo is free, yet introspective in a way that allows the player to personalize the experience of playing it by responding to the notes and occasional [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]. Thus the use of [[rubato]] becomes essential. Both hands play their single notes at the same time.\n\nOnly two types of notes appear in the score: [[whole notes]] and stemless black notes (more free as to their duration). It has only 15 bars of written music: the first bar has the low bass octave. From there onwards begins the following pattern: the second bar has one note-head and one whole note, the next bar has two quarter notes and a whole note, and so on until a bar that has seven quarter notes and a whole note. This pattern then scales down again, to one quarter note and a half note. The last bar has two quarter notes and a half note. In other words, the first bar has one note, the second has two, the third has three, and so on. It is built as such: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3. The compositional symmetry mirrors the harmonic symmetry.\n\nIf played softly enough, with the pedal down and given enough time, the notes (often resulting in minor and major clashes between B and C#, D and E, and F# and G) can produce a humming of dissonance in the piano's machinery, a phenomenon that only adds to the transcendental nature of the piece.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe entire harmonic structure, save for one note, is constructed so that the left hand part is the highest note in a B Minor chord which is below the melody line. Thus, when the melody is on a C# or D, the left hand is on a B. When the melody is on an E or F#, the left hand is on a D, and when the melody is on a G, A, or B, the left hand is on an F#. The only break from this harmonic structure appears when the left hand hits a C# below an F# in the right hand, synchronous with the release of the pedal at the end of the 11th bar.\n\n== Recordings ==\nA release endorsed by P\u00e4rt himself is the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] New Series album entitled '''Alina''', recorded in July 1995 and released in 1999. It includes two variations of ''F\u00fcr Alina'' by pianist [[Alexander Malter]].

{"title_page": "John Hagthorpe", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{lead too short|date=January 2019}}\n'''John Hagthorpe''' ([[fl.]] 1627) was an English poet.\n\n==Life==\nHagthorpe was the son of Rowland Hagthorpe (died 1593) of [[Nettlesworth]] in the parish of [[Chester-le-Street]], [[County Durham]], by his first wife, Clare, daughter of Sir Ralph Hedworth, of [[Harraton]] in the same county. He was baptised 12 February 1585.<ref>Surtees, Durham, ii. 204</ref> In his writings he refers to the time when he lived in [[Scarborough Castle]], [[Yorkshire]]. He married Judith, daughter of Anthony Wye, who had a lawsuit in 1605 with Elizabeth Saltonstall, mother of [[Wye Saltonstall]], the poet.<ref>Hunter, Chorus Vatum, i. 105</ref>\n\n==Reduction of property==\nIn 1607 he sold his manor and estate of Nettlesworth to John Claxton. On 27 February 1608, being then of [[Whixley]], Yorkshire, he surrendered certain copyhold lands in Chester-le-Street to the use of Henry Thompson and Jane his wife, who was his father's widow. In 1611 license was granted to him and Judith, his wife, to alienate to Francis Wright the half of [[Greenbury Grange]] in the parish of [[Scorton, North Yorkshire|Scorton]], near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. He does not seem to have profited by these transactions, for he complains bitterly in the dedication of his \u2018Divine Meditations\u2019 to [[James I of England|James I]] of poverty caused by lawsuits in which he had been worsted. Fearing that he might be compelled to emigrate with his family to [[Virginia]], he entreated the king to procure for his son a presentation to [[Charterhouse School]]. He added that there was not a man named Hagthorpe in England 'beside myself and mine.' If this statement be literally true he must be identical with the Captain John Hagthorpe who, on 22 April 1626, was certified by Robert Hemsworth as a fit person to command 'one of the ships to waft the cloth fleet to the East land'.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6, p.&nbsp;316</ref> During the same year Captain Hagthorpe did good service in protecting the [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] ships bound for [[Holland]] against the attacks of the 'Dunkirkers'.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6, pp.&nbsp;352, 405, 420</ref> He had also taken part in the [[Cadiz]] expedition of 1625, and with four other captains petitioned [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] on 20 September 1626 for payment of the king's gratuity of one hundred nobles.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6, p.&nbsp;433</ref> A week later he was charged by William Hope, gunner of the Rose of Woodbridge, with illegally selling ship's stores,<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6 p.&nbsp;438</ref> a course he was probably driven to adopt on account of the persistent neglect of the admiralty to furnish him with victuals and beer.\n\n==Poetry==\nJohn Hagthorpe the poet was the author of: 1. \u2018Divine Meditations and Elegies,\u2019 16mo, London, 1622. A selection from this tiny volume was presented to the [[Roxburghe Club]] in 1817 by [[Sir S. E. Brydges]] under the title of \u2018Hagthorpe Revived; or Select Specimens of a forgotten Poet.\u2019 2. \u2018Visiones Rervm.

He was baptised 12 February 1585.<ref>Surtees, Durham, ii. 204</ref> In his writings he refers to the time when he lived in [[Scarborough Castle]], [[Yorkshire]]. He married Judith, daughter of Anthony Wye, who had a lawsuit in 1605 with Elizabeth Saltonstall, mother of [[Wye Saltonstall]], the poet.<ref>Hunter, Chorus Vatum, i. 105</ref>\n\n==Reduction of property==\nIn 1607 he sold his manor and estate of Nettlesworth to John Claxton. On 27 February 1608, being then of [[Whixley]], Yorkshire, he surrendered certain copyhold lands in Chester-le-Street to the use of Henry Thompson and Jane his wife, who was his father's widow. In 1611 license was granted to him and Judith, his wife, to alienate to Francis Wright the half of [[Greenbury Grange]] in the parish of [[Scorton, North Yorkshire|Scorton]], near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. He does not seem to have profited by these transactions, for he complains bitterly in the dedication of his \u2018Divine Meditations\u2019 to [[James I of England|James I]] of poverty caused by lawsuits in which he had been worsted. Fearing that he might be compelled to emigrate with his family to [[Virginia]], he entreated the king to procure for his son a presentation to [[Charterhouse School]]. He added that there was not a man named Hagthorpe in England 'beside myself and mine.' If this statement be literally true he must be identical with the Captain John Hagthorpe who, on 22 April 1626, was certified by Robert Hemsworth as a fit person to command 'one of the ships to waft the cloth fleet to the East land'.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6, p.&nbsp;316</ref> During the same year Captain Hagthorpe did good service in protecting the [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] ships bound for [[Holland]] against the attacks of the 'Dunkirkers'.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6, pp.&nbsp;352, 405, 420</ref> He had also taken part in the [[Cadiz]] expedition of 1625, and with four other captains petitioned [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] on 20 September 1626 for payment of the king's gratuity of one hundred nobles.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6, p.&nbsp;433</ref> A week later he was charged by William Hope, gunner of the Rose of Woodbridge, with illegally selling ship's stores,<ref>Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1625-6 p.&nbsp;438</ref> a course he was probably driven to adopt on account of the persistent neglect of the admiralty to furnish him with victuals and beer.\n\n==Poetry==\nJohn Hagthorpe the poet was the author of: 1. \u2018Divine Meditations and Elegies,\u2019 16mo, London, 1622. A selection from this tiny volume was presented to the [[Roxburghe Club]] in 1817 by [[Sir S. E. Brydges]] under the title of \u2018Hagthorpe Revived; or Select Specimens of a forgotten Poet.\u2019 2. \u2018Visiones Rervm.
