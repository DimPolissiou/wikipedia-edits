Section.jpg|thumb|Final stage of the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469}}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8&nbsp;cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time.

The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water.

It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=April 2003 |volume=501 |issue=2-3 |pages=418\u2013462 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(03)00425-X}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004.

Construction of the entire INGRID detector and majority of the ND280 detector (without barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter) was completed in 2009. The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010.

Achievement of these goals requires reduction of the statistical and systematic errors, and thus a significant upgrade of the beamline and the ND280 detector, as well as improvements in the software and analysis methods.<ref name=\"upgradeproposal\"/>\n\n====Beam upgrade====\n\nThe beam upgrade plan requires one year long shut down of the [[J-PARC]] Main Ring [[particle accelerator|accelerator]] in 2021, followed by a constant gradual increase of the [[proton]] [[particle beam|beam]] power until the start of the HK experiment. The beam power should reach 750&nbsp;kW in 2022 and then grow to 1.3 MW by 2029.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration and J-PARC Neutrino Facility Group |title=J-PARC Neutrino Beamline Upgrade Technical Design Report |date=14 August 2019 |arxiv=1908.05141}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2020, the proton beam power reached 515&nbsp;kW with 2.7x10<sup>14</sup> protons per pulse and with 2.48 seconds between pulses (so-called repetition cycle). To reach 750&nbsp;kW, the repetition cycle will be reduced to 1.32 s with 2.0x10<sup>14</sup> protons per pulse, while for 1.3 MW the repetition cycle has to be further decreased to 1.16 s and the number of protons per pulse has to increase to 3.2x10<sup>14</sup>. In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the [[magnetic horn|horns]] focusing secondary particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, etc.) with a chosen [[electric charge]] will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |language=en |issn=1742-6588}}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |arxiv=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199}}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |arxiv=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469}}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8 cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger||display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode. TPCs are filled with argon-based drift gas under atmospheric pressure. Charged particles crossing TPC ionise the gas along their track. The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time. In the magnetic field, the curvature of this path allows to determine [[electric charge|charge]] and [[momentum]] of the particle, and the amount of the ionisation electrons per unit distance is used to identify particles based on the [[Bethe formula|Bethe-Bloch formula]].<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K ND280 TPC collaboration |title=Time projection chambers for the T2K near detectors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=May 2011 |volume=637 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201346 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2011.02.036|arxiv=1012.0865}}</ref>\n\n====Fine-grained detectors====\n\nTwo fine-grained detectors (FGDs) are placed after the first and second TPCs. Together the FGDs and TPCs make up the tracker of ND280. The FGDs provide the active target mass for the neutrino interactions and are able to measure the short tracks of proton recoil. The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water-based. Cross sections on carbon and on the water can be determined from a comparison of neutrino interactions in the two FGDs. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K ND280 FGD Collaboration |title=The T2K fine-grained detectors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=December 2012 |volume=696 |pages=1\u201331 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.08.020 |url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3666}}</ref>\n\n====Electromagnetic Calorimeter====\n\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the inner detectors (P0D, TPCs, FGDs) and consists of scintillator layers sandwiched with lead absorber sheets. Its role is to detect neutral particles, especially photons, and measure their energy and direction, as well as to detect charged particles providing additional information relevant for their identification. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K UK Collaboration |title=The electromagnetic calorimeter for the T2K near detector ND280 |journal=Journal of Instrumentation |date=17 October 2013 |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=P10019\u2013P10019 |doi=10.1088/1748-0221/8/10/P10019 |arxiv=1308.3445}}</ref>\n\n====Side Muon Range Detector====\n\nThe Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) consists of scintillator modules which are inserted into the gaps in the magnet. The SMRD records muons escaping the inner parts of the detector at large angles with respect to the beam direction. It can also act as a trigger for [[cosmic rays]]. Finally, it can help identify beam interactions in the surrounding walls and in the magnet itself. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Aoki|first2=G|last2=Barr||display-authors=1|title=The T2K Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=January 2013 |volume=698 |pages=135\u2013146 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.10.001|arxiv=1206.3553}}</ref>\n\n==Super-Kamiokande==\n{{main|Super-Kamiokande}}\n\nSuper-Kamiokande detector is located 1000 m underground in the Mozumi Mine, under Mount Ikeno in the Kamoka area of Hida city. It is a [[stainless steel]] [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tank of about 40 m height and diameter, filled with 50,000 tons of [[water]] and instrumented with around 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMT). It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=April 2003 |volume=501 |issue=2-3 |pages=418\u2013462 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(03)00425-X}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004.

The K2K experiment results confirmed at the level of at 99.9985% confidence (4.3 [[Standard deviation|\u03c3]]) the [[neutrino oscillation|disappearance]] of the [[muon neutrino]]s and were consistent with the previous measurements of oscillation parameters measured by the Super-Kamiokande detector for [[atmospheric neutrino]]s. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oyama |first1=Yuichi |title=Results from K2K and status of T2K |journal=arXiv:hep-ex/0512041 |date=2006 |pages=113\u2013124 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4965-1_9 |arxiv=hep-ex/0512041}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=K2K Collaboration |title=Measurement of neutrino oscillation by the K2K experiment |journal=Physical Review D |date=12 October 2006 |volume=74 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.74.072003|arxiv=hep-ex/0606032}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the neutrino beamline started in 2004 and it was successfully commissioned in 2009. Construction of the entire INGRID detector and majority of the ND280 detector (without barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter) was completed in 2009. The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010. T2K far detector is the large Super-Kamiokande detector, which has been running since 1996 and studying [[proton lifetime]] and oscillations of [[atmospheric neutrino|atmospheric]], [[solar neutrino|solar]] and [[accelerator neutrino|accelerator]] neutrinos. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nT2K experiment started to take neutrino data for a physics analysis in January 2010, initially with an incomplete ND280 detector, and starting from November 2010 with the full setup. The data taking was interrupted for one year by the [[Great Tohoku Earthquake]] in March 2011. The proton beam power, and thus the neutrino beam intensity, was constantly growing, reaching by February 2020 the power of 515 kW and a total number of accumulated protons on target of 3.64\u00d710<sup>21</sup> protons <ref>{{cite web |title=T2K experiment official page - T2K Run 10 |url=https://t2k-experiment.org/2020/02/t2k-run-10-ended-with-record-beam-power/}}</ref> with 55% of data in neutrino-mode and 45% in antineutrino-mode.\n\n==Future plans==\n\nThe T2K experiment is expected to operate in the current form until the end of 2020. In 2021 a major upgrade of the neutrino beamline and the ND280 near detector will be performed. From 2022 till 2026 neutrino data will be taken within the second phase of the T2K experiment (T2K-II)<ref name=\"upgradeproposal\"/>. In 2025, the successor of the T2K experiment will be launched, the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment, with the new, 250,000-ton water [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] far detector - the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] detector<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics Potential of a Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Experiment Using J-PARC Neutrino Beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05199 |issn=2050-3911}}</ref><ref name=\"hyperk\">{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboration |title=Hyper-Kamiokande Design Report |journal=arXiv:1805.04163 [astro-ph, physics:hep-ex, physics:physics] |date=28 November 2018 |arxiv=1805.04163}}</ref>. The building of an additional Intermediate Water Cherenkov detector at a distance of around 2 km is also considered for the HK experiment<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>.\n\n===T2K-II===\n\nThe phase II of the T2K experiment is expected to start in 2022 and last until 2025 or 2026 following by the HK experiment commence. The physics goals of T2K-II are a measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters ''\u03b8''<sub>23</sub> and \u0394''m''{{su|b=23|p=2}} with a precision of 1.7\u00b0 and 1%, respectively, as well as a confirmation at the level of 3 [[Standard deviation|\u03c3]] or more the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the neutrino sector in a wide range of possible true values of ''\u03b4''<sub>CP</sub> - the parameter responsible for the [[CP violation|CP]] (matter-antimatter) asymmetry. Achievement of these goals requires reduction of the statistical and systematic errors, and thus a significant upgrade of the beamline and the ND280 detector, as well as improvements in the software and analysis methods. <ref name=\"upgradeproposal\"/>\n\n====Beam upgrade====\n\nThe beam upgrade plan requires one year long shut down of the [[J-PARC]] Main Ring [[particle accelerator|accelerator]] in 2021, followed by a constant gradual increase of the [[proton]] [[particle beam|beam]] power until the start of the HK experiment. The beam power should reach 750 kW in 2022 and then grow to 1.3 MW by 2029. <ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration and J-PARC Neutrino Facility Group |title=J-PARC Neutrino Beamline Upgrade Technical Design Report |journal=arXiv:1908.05141 [hep-ex, physics:physics] |date=14 August 2019 |arxiv=1908.05141}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2020, the proton beam power reached 515 kW with 2.7x10<sup>14</sup> protons per pulse and with 2.48 seconds between pulses (so-called repetition cycle). To reach 750 kW, the repetition cycle will be reduced to 1.32 s with 2.0x10<sup>14</sup> protons per pulse, while for 1.3 MW the repetition cycle has to be further decreased to 1.16 s and the number of protons per pulse has to increase to 3.2x10<sup>14</sup>. In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the [[magnetic horn|horns]] focusing secondary particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, etc.) with a chosen [[electric charge]] will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%. <ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |language=en |issn=1742-6588}}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water. <ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below. <ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |journal=arXiv:1901.03750 [hep-ex, physics:physics] |date=11 January 2019 |arxiv=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1 cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy. <ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs. <ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors. <ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions. <ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment.

The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle. <ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47-50}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |journal=arXiv:1412.3086 [hep-ex, physics:physics] |date=13 December 2014 |url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Headbomb", "label": "safe", "comment": "Various citation & identifier cleanup, plus AWB genfixes (arxiv version pointless when published)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}

Braces also fix gaps. They are often used to correct [[underbites]], as well as [[malocclusion]]s, [[overbite]]s, open bites, [[deep bites]], [[cross bites]], crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and [[jaw]]. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often used in conjunction with other orthodontic appliances to help widen the [[palate]] or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.\n[[File:Orthobraces - dental braces lower upper jaw.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Dental Braces]]\n\n== Process ==\n\nThe application of braces moves the teeth as a result of force and pressure on the teeth. There are traditionally four basic elements that are used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic (also called an \u201cO-ring\u201d). The teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n\nBraces have constant pressure which, over time, move teeth into the desired positions. The process loosens the tooth after which new bone grows in to support the tooth in its new position. This is called [[bone remodeling]]. Bone remodeling is a biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger in response to sustained load-bearing activity and weaker in the absence of carrying a load. Bones are made of cells called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Two different kinds of bone resorption are possible: direct resorption, which starts from the lining cells of the alveolar bone, and indirect or retrograde resorption, which takes place when the periodontal ligament has been subjected to an excessive amount and duration of compressive stress.<ref>Robling, Alexander G., Alesha B Castillo, and Charles H. Turner, \"Biochemical and Molecular Regulation of Bone Remodeling\", Annual Review of Biochemical Engineering, (April 3, 2006) pp 1\u201312</ref> Another important factor associated with tooth movement is bone deposition. Bone deposition occurs in the distracted periodontal ligament. Without bone deposition, the tooth will loosen and voids will occur distal to the direction of tooth movement.<ref>{{cite journal|work=Orthopedic Research Society|title=Bone disposition, bone resorption, and osteosarcoma|pmid=20225287 | doi=10.1002/jor.21120|volume=28|pages=1142\u20138|vauthors=Toledo SR, Oliveira ID, Okamoto OK, Zago MA, de Seixas Alves MT, Filho RJ, Macedo CR, Petrilli AS}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[File:Transparent-Bracket.JPG|thumb|\"Clear\" braces]]\n* '''''Traditional metal wired''' braces'' are stainless-steel and are sometimes used in combination with titanium. Traditional metal braces are the most common type of braces. These braces have a metal bracket with [[Elastics (orthodontics)|elastic (rubber band) ties]] holding the wire onto the metal brackets. The second-most common type of braces are self-ligating braces that do not require elastic ties. Instead, the wire goes through the bracket. Often with this type of braces, treatment time is reduced, there is less pain on the teeth, and fewer adjustments are required than with traditional braces.\n* '''''Gold-plated stainless steel''''' braces are often employed for patients allergic to nickel (a basic and important component of stainless steel), but may also be chosen because some people simply prefer the look of gold over the traditional silver-colored braces.\n* '''''[[Lingual braces|Lingual]]''' braces'' are a cosmetic alternative in which custom-made braces are bonded to the back of the teeth making them externally invisible. \n* '''''Titanium''' braces'' resemble stainless steel braces but are lighter and just as strong. People with allergies to the nickel in steel often choose titanium braces, but they are more expensive than stainless steel braces.\n* '''''Customized orthodontic treatment systems'''''  combine high-technology including 3-D imaging, treatment planning software and a robot to custom bend the wire. Customized systems such as this offer faster treatment times and more efficient results.<ref>Alana K. Saxe, DMD/Lenore J. Louie, MSc, DMD/James Mah, DDS, MSc, DMSc, \"World Journal of Orthodontics\", 2010;11:16\u201322.</ref> \n* '''''Progressive, clear removable aligners''''' may be used to gradually move teeth into their final positions. Aligners are generally not used for complex orthodontic cases, such as when extractions, jaw surgery, or palate expansion are necessary. {{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Fitting procedure ==\n[[File:Braces cement placement.jpg|thumb|A patient's teeth are prepared for application of braces.]]\nOrthodontic services may be provided by any licensed dentist trained in orthodontics. In North America most orthodontic treatment is done by [[orthodontists]], who are dentists in diagnosis and treatment of ''[[malocclusion]]s''\u2014malalignments of the teeth, jaws, or both. A dentist must complete 2\u20133 years of additional post-doctoral training to earn a specialty certificate in orthodontics. There are many general practitioners who also provide orthodontic services.\n\nThe first step is to determine whether braces are suitable for the patient. The doctor consults with the patient and inspects the teeth visually. If braces are appropriate, a records appointment is set up where [[X-ray]]s, molds, and impressions are made. These records are analyzed to determine the problems and proper course of action. The use of digital models is rapidly increasing in the orthodontic industry. Digital treatment starts with the creation of a three-dimensional digital model of the patient's arches. This model is produced by laser-scanning plaster models created using dental impressions. Computer-automated treatment simulation has the ability to automatically separate the gums and teeth from one another and can handle malocclusions well; this software enables clinicians to ensure, in a virtual setting, that the selected treatment will produce the optimal outcome, with minimal user input.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n\nTypical treatment times vary from six months to two and a half years depending on the complexity and types of problems. [[Orthognathic surgery]] may be required in extreme cases. About 2 weeks before the braces are applied, [[orthodontic spacer]]s may be required to spread apart back teeth in order to create enough space for the bands.\n\nTeeth to be braced will have an adhesive applied to help the cement bond to the surface of the tooth. In most cases the teeth will be banded and then brackets will be added. A bracket will be applied with dental cement, and then cured with light until hardened. This process usually takes a few seconds per tooth. If required, orthodontic spacers may be inserted between the [[molar tooth|molars]] to make room for molar bands to be placed at a later date. Molar bands are required to ensure brackets will stick. Bands are also utilized when [[dental fillings]] or other dental work make securing a bracket to a tooth infeasible.\n\nAn [[archwire]] will be threaded between the brackets and affixed with elastic or metal [[Ligature (orthodontic)|ligatures]]. Ligatures are available in a wide variety of colors, and the patient can choose which color they like. Archwires are bent, shaped, and tightened frequently to achieve the desired results.\n[[File:Dental braces.jpg|thumb|left|Dental braces, with a transparent power chain, removed after completion of treatment.]]\n\nModern orthodontics makes frequent use of nickel-titanium archwires and temperature-sensitive materials. When cold, the archwire is limp and flexible, easily threaded between brackets of any configuration. Once heated to body temperature, the archwire will stiffen and seek to retain its shape, creating constant light force on the teeth.\n\nBrackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can be created and affixed to the archwire to affix rubber bands to. The placement and configuration of the rubber bands will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Rubber bands are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths. They are also typically available in two versions: colored or clear/opaque.\n\nThe fitting process can vary between different types of braces, though there are similarities such as the initial steps of molding the teeth before application. For example, with clear braces, impressions of a patient's teeth are evaluated to create a series of trays, which fit to the patient's mouth almost like a protective mouthpiece. With some forms of braces, the brackets are placed in a special form that are customized to the patient's mouth, drastically reducing the application time.\n\nIn many cases there is insufficient space in the mouth for all the teeth to fit properly. There are two main procedures to make room in these cases. One is extraction: teeth are removed to create more space. The second is expansion, in which the palate or arch is made larger by using a [[palatal expander]]. Expanders can be used with both children and adults. Since the bones of adults are already fused, expanding the palate is not possible without surgery to unfuse them. An expander can be used on an adult without surgery, but would be used to expand the [[dental arch]], and not the [[palate]].\n\nSometimes children and teenage patients, and occasionally adults, are required to wear a headgear appliance as part of the primary treatment phase to keep certain teeth from moving (for more detail on headgear and facemask appliances see [[Orthodontic headgear]]). When braces put pressure on one's teeth, the periodontal membrane stretches on one side and is compressed on the other. This movement needs to be done slowly or otherwise the patient risks losing his teeth. This is why braces are worn as long as they are and adjustments are only made every so often.\n\nBraces are typically adjusted every three to six weeks. This helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When they get adjusted, the orthodontist removes the colored or metal ligatures keeping the archwire in place. The archwire is then removed, and may be replaced or modified. When the archwire has been placed back into the mouth, the patient may choose a color for the new elastic ligatures, which are then affixed to the metal brackets. The adjusting process may cause some discomfort to the patient, which is normal.\n\n== Post-treatment ==\nPatients may need post-orthodontic surgery, such as a [[fiberotomy]] or alternatively a gum lift, to prepare their teeth for retainer use and improve the gumline contours after the braces come off.\n==Dental Braces material==\n*[https://www.adentalls.com/product-category/fix-braces/.html There are many types of dental braces material like low quality and High quality.To get more infomation] \n\n=== Retainers ===\n{{Main|Retainer (orthodontic device)}}\n[[File: ClockFace Retainers.jpg|thumb|Hawley retainers are the most common type of retainers. This picture shows retainers for the top and bottom of the mouth.]]\nIn order to prevent the teeth from moving back to their original position, [[Retainer (orthodontics)|retainers]] are worn once the treatment is complete. Retainers help in maintaining and stabilizing the position of teeth long enough to permit the reorganization of the supporting structures after the active phase of orthodontic therapy. If the patient does not wear the retainer appropriately and/or for the right amount of time, the teeth may move towards their previous position. For regular braces, Hawley retainers are used. They are made of metal hooks that surround the teeth and are enclosed by an acrylic plate shaped to fit the patient's palate. For Invisalign braces, an Essix retainer is used. This is similar to the regular Invisalign braces; it is a clear plastic tray that is firmly fitted to the teeth, which stays in place without a plate fitted to the palate. There is also a bonded retainer where a wire is permanently bonded to the lingual side of the teeth, usually the lower teeth only.\n\n=== Headgear ===\n{{main|Orthodontic headgear}}\nHeadgear needs to be worn between 12\u201322 hours each day to be effective in correcting the [[overbite]], typically for 12 to 18 months depending on the severity of the overbite, how much it is worn and what growth stage the patient is in. Typically the prescribed daily wear time will be between 14 and 16 hours a day and is frequently used post-primary treatment phase to maintain the position of the jaw and arch.\n\nOrthodontic headgear will usually consist of three major components:\n[[File: Full orthodontic headgear with head cap and fitting straps.jpg|thumb|right|Full orthodontic headgear with head cap, fitting straps, facebow and elastics]]\n# Facebow: first, the facebow (or J-Hooks) is fitted with a metal arch onto headgear tubes attached to the rear upper and lower molars. This facebow then extends out of the mouth and around the patients' faces. J-Hooks are different in that they hook into the patient's mouth and attach directly to the brace (see photo for an example of J-Hooks).\n# Head cap: the second component is the headcap, which typically consists of one or a number of straps fitting around the patient's head. This is attached with elastic bands or springs to the facebow. Additional straps and attachments are used to ensure comfort and safety (see photo).\n# Attachment: the third and final component\u2014typically consisting of rubber bands, elastics, or springs\u2014joins the facebow or J-Hooks and the head cap together, providing the force to move the upper teeth, jaw backward.\nThe headgear application is one of the most useful appliances available to the orthodontist when looking to correct a Class II  malocclusion. See more details in the section [[Orthodontic headgear]].\n\n=== Pre-finisher ===\nThe pre-finisher is molded to the patient's teeth by use of extreme pressure to the appliance by the person's jaw. The product is then worn a certain amount of time with the user applying force to the appliance in their mouth for 10 to 15 seconds at a time. The goal of the process is to increase the exercise time in applying the force to the appliance.  If a person's teeth are not ready for a proper retainer the orthodontist may prescribe the use of a preformed finishing appliance such as the pre-finisher. This appliance fixes gaps between the teeth, small spaces between the upper and lower jaw, and other minor problems.\n\n== Complications and risks ==\nExperiencing some [[pain]] following fitting and activation of fixed orthodontic braces is very common and several methods have been suggested to tackle this.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eslamian L, Borzabadi-Farahani A, Hassanzadeh-Azhiri A, Badiee MR, Fekrazad R |title=The effect of 810-nm low-level laser therapy on pain caused by orthodontic elastomeric separators|journal=Lasers Med Sci|volume=29|pages=559\u201364 |issue=2 |date= 2014 |PMID=23334785 |doi=10.1007/s10103-012-1258-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eslamian L, Borzabadi-Farahani A, Edini HZ, Badiee MR, Lynch E, Mortazavi A |title=The analgesic effect of benzocaine mucoadhesive patches on orthodontic pain caused by elastomeric separators, a preliminary study.|journal=Acta Odontol Scand|volume=71|pages=1168\u201373 |issue=5 |date= 2013 |PMID=23301559 |doi=10.3109/00016357.2012.757358}}</ref>\n\nThe dental displacement obtained with the orthodontic appliance determines in most cases some degree of [[root resorption]].

Around 400-300 BC, [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] contemplated ways to straighten teeth and fix various dental conditions. Archaeologists have discovered numerous mummified ancient individuals with what appear to be metal bands wrapped around their teeth. [[Catgut]], a type of cord made from the natural fibers of an animal's intestines, performed a similar role to today\u2019s orthodontic wire in closing gaps in the teeth and mouth.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] buried their dead with dental appliances in place to maintain space and prevent collapse of the teeth during the afterlife. A Roman tomb was found with a number of teeth bound with gold wire documented as a ligature wire, a small elastic wire that is used to affix the arch wire to the bracket. Even [[Cleopatra]] wore a pair. Roman philosopher and physician [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] first recorded the treatment of teeth by finger pressure. Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, poor preservation of bodies, and primitive technology, little research was carried out on dental braces until around the 17th century, although dentistry was making great advancements as a profession by then.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Portrait de Pierre Fauchard dans un livre ancien d'odontologie.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Pierre Fauchard|Fauchard]] from his 1728 edition of ''\"The Surgical Dentist\"''.]]\nOrthodontics truly began developing in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn 1728, French dentist [[Pierre Fauchard]], who is often credited with inventing modern orthodontics, published a book entitled ''\"The Surgeon Dentist\"'' on methods of straightening teeth. Fauchard, in his practice, used a device called a \"Bandeau\", a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that helped expand the palate.\nIn 1754, another French dentist, [[Louis Bourdet]], dentist to the King of France, followed Fauchard's book with ''The Dentist's Art'', which also dedicated a chapter to tooth alignment and application. He perfected the \"Bandeau\" and was the first dentist on record to recommend extraction of the premolar teeth to alleviate crowding and to improve jaw growth.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nAlthough teeth and palate straightening and/or pulling was used to improve alignment of remaining teeth and had been practiced since early times, orthodontics, as a science of its own, did not really exist until the mid-19th century. Several important dentists helped to advance dental braces with specific instruments and tools that allowed braces to be improved.\n\nIn 1819, Delabarre introduced the wire crib, which marked the birth of contemporary orthodontics, and gum elastics were first employed by Maynard in 1843. Tucker was the first to cut rubber bands from rubber tubing in 1850. Dentist, writer, artist, and sculptor [[Norman William Kingsley]] in 1858 wrote the first article on orthodontics and in 1880, his book, ''Treatise on Oral Deformities'', was published. A dentist named [[John Nutting Farrar]] is credited for writing two volumes entitled, ''A Treatise on the Irregularities of the Teeth and Their Corrections'' and was the first to suggest the use of mild force at timed intervals to move teeth.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the early 20th century, [[Edward Angle]] devised the first simple classification system for malocclusions, such as Class I, Class II, and so on. His classification system is still used today as a way for dentists to describe how crooked teeth are, what way teeth are pointing, and how teeth fit together. Angle contributed greatly to the design of orthodontic and dental appliances, making many simplifications. He founded the first school and college of orthodontics, organized the American Society of Orthodontia in 1901 which became the [[American Association of Orthodontists]] (AAO) in the 1930s, and founded the first orthodontic journal in 1907. Other innovations in orthodontics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included the first textbook on orthodontics for children, published by J.J. Guilford in 1889, and the use of rubber elastics, pioneered by [[Calvin Case|Calvin S. Case]], along with [[Henry Albert Baker]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mandibular advancement splint]]\n* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n* [[Orthognathic surgery]]\n* [[Prosthodontics]]\n* [[Trismus]]\n* [[Dental implant]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commonscatinline}}\n\n{{Orthodontics}}\n\n[[Category:Dental equipment]]\n[[Category:Orthodontic appliances]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n'''Dental braces''' (also known as '''braces''', '''orthodontic cases''', or  '''cases''') are devices used in [[orthodontics]] that align and straighten [[teeth]] and help  position them with regard to a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health.

Once heated to body temperature, the archwire will stiffen and seek to retain its shape, creating constant light force on the teeth.\n\nBrackets with hooks can be placed, or hooks can be created and affixed to the archwire to affix rubber bands to. The placement and configuration of the rubber bands will depend on the course of treatment and the individual patient. Rubber bands are made in different diameters, colors, sizes, and strengths. They are also typically available in two versions: colored or clear/opaque.\n\nThe fitting process can vary between different types of braces, though there are similarities such as the initial steps of molding the teeth before application. For example, with clear braces, impressions of a patient's teeth are evaluated to create a series of trays, which fit to the patient's mouth almost like a protective mouthpiece. With some forms of braces, the brackets are placed in a special form that are customized to the patient's mouth, drastically reducing the application time.\n\nIn many cases there is insufficient space in the mouth for all the teeth to fit properly. There are two main procedures to make room in these cases. One is extraction: teeth are removed to create more space. The second is expansion, in which the palate or arch is made larger by using a [[palatal expander]]. Expanders can be used with both children and adults. Since the bones of adults are already fused, expanding the palate is not possible without surgery to unfuse them. An expander can be used on an adult without surgery, but would be used to expand the [[dental arch]], and not the [[palate]].\n\nSometimes children and teenage patients, and occasionally adults, are required to wear a headgear appliance as part of the primary treatment phase to keep certain teeth from moving (for more detail on headgear and facemask appliances see [[Orthodontic headgear]]). When braces put pressure on one's teeth, the periodontal membrane stretches on one side and is compressed on the other. This movement needs to be done slowly or otherwise the patient risks losing his teeth. This is why braces are worn as long as they are and adjustments are only made every so often.\n\nBraces are typically adjusted every three to six weeks. This helps shift the teeth into the correct position. When they get adjusted, the orthodontist removes the colored or metal ligatures keeping the archwire in place. The archwire is then removed, and may be replaced or modified. When the archwire has been placed back into the mouth, the patient may choose a color for the new elastic ligatures, which are then affixed to the metal brackets. The adjusting process may cause some discomfort to the patient, which is normal.\n\n== Post-treatment ==\nPatients may need post-orthodontic surgery, such as a [[fiberotomy]] or alternatively a gum lift, to prepare their teeth for retainer use and improve the gumline contours after the braces come off.\n\n=== Retainers ===\n{{Main|Retainer (orthodontic device)}}\n[[File:ClockFace Retainers.jpg|thumb|Hawley retainers are the most common type of retainers. This picture shows retainers for the top and bottom of the mouth.]]\nIn order to prevent the teeth from moving back to their original position, [[Retainer (orthodontics)|retainers]] are worn once the treatment is complete. Retainers help in maintaining and stabilizing the position of teeth long enough to permit reorganization of the supporting structures after the active phase of orthodontic therapy. If the patient does not wear the retainer appropriately and/or for the right amount of time, the teeth may move towards their previous position. For regular braces, Hawley retainers are used. They are made of metal hooks that surround the teeth and are enclosed by an acrylic plate shaped to fit the patient's palate. For invisalign braces, an Essix retainer is used. This is similar to the regular invisalign braces; it is a clear plastic tray that is firmly fitted to the teeth, which stays in place without a plate fitted to the palate. There is also a bonded retainer where a wire is permanently bonded to the lingual side of the teeth, usually the lower teeth only.\n\n=== Headgear ===\n{{main|Orthodontic headgear}}\nHeadgear needs to be worn between 12\u201322 hours each day to be effective in correcting the [[overbite]], typically for 12 to 18 months depending on the severity of the overbite, how much it is worn and what growth stage the patient is in. Typically the prescribed daily wear time will be between 14 and 16 hours a day and is frequently used post primary treatment phase to maintain the position of the jaw and arch.\n\nOrthodontic headgear will usually consist of three major components:\n[[File:Full orthodontic headgear with headcap and fitting straps.jpg|thumb|right|Full orthodontic headgear with headcap, fitting straps, facebow and elastics]]\n# Facebow: first, the facebow (or J-Hooks) is fitted with a metal arch onto headgear tubes attached to the rear upper and lower molars. This facebow then extends out of the mouth and around the patients face. J-Hooks are different in that they hook into the patients mouth and attach directly to the brace (see photo for example of J-Hooks).\n# Head cap: the second component is the headcap, which typically consists of one or a number of straps fitting around the patients head. This is attached with elastic bands or springs to the facebow. Additional straps and attachments are used to ensure comfort and safety (see photo).\n# Attachment: the third and final component\u2014typically consisting of rubber bands, elastics, or springs\u2014joins the facebow or J-Hooks and the headcap together, providing the force to move the upper teeth, jaw backwards.\nThe headgear application is one of the most useful appliances available to the orthodontist when looking to correct a Class II  malocclusion. See more details in the section [[Orthodontic headgear]].\n\n=== Pre-finisher ===\nThe pre-finisher is molded to the patient's teeth by use of extreme pressure to the appliance by the person's jaw. The product is then worn a certain amount of time with the user applying force to the appliance in their mouth for 10 to 15 seconds at a time. The goal of the process is to increase the exercise time in applying the force to the appliance.  If a person's teeth are not ready for a proper retainer the orthodontist may prescribe the use of a preformed finishing appliance such as the pre-finisher. This appliance fixes gaps between the teeth, small spaces between the upper and lower jaw, and other minor problems.\n\n== Complications and risks ==\nExperiencing some [[pain]] following fitting and activation of fixed orthodontic braces is very common and several methods have been suggested to tackle this.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eslamian L, Borzabadi-Farahani A, Hassanzadeh-Azhiri A, Badiee MR, Fekrazad R |title=The effect of 810-nm low-level laser therapy on pain caused by orthodontic elastomeric separators|journal=Lasers Med Sci|volume=29|pages=559\u201364 |issue=2 |date= 2014 |PMID=23334785 |doi=10.1007/s10103-012-1258-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eslamian L, Borzabadi-Farahani A, Edini HZ, Badiee MR, Lynch E, Mortazavi A |title=The analgesic effect of benzocaine mucoadhesive patches on orthodontic pain caused by elastomeric separators, a preliminary study.|journal=Acta Odontol Scand|volume=71|pages=1168\u201373 |issue=5 |date= 2013 |PMID=23301559 |doi=10.3109/00016357.2012.757358}}</ref>\n\nThe dental displacement obtained with the orthodontic appliance determines in most cases some degree of [[root resorption]].

Around 400-300 BC, [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] contemplated ways to straighten teeth and fix various dental conditions. Archaeologists have discovered numerous mummified ancient individuals with what appear to be metal bands wrapped around their teeth. [[Catgut]], a type of cord made from the natural fibers of an animal's intestines, performed a similar role to today\u2019s orthodontic wire in closing gaps in the teeth and mouth.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] buried their dead with dental appliances in place to maintain space and prevent collapse of the teeth during the afterlife. A Roman tomb was found with a number of teeth bound with gold wire documented as a ligature wire, a small elastic wire that is used to affix the arch wire to the bracket. Even [[Cleopatra]] wore a pair. Roman philosopher and physician [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] first recorded the treatment of teeth by finger pressure. Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, poor preservation of bodies, and primitive technology, little research was carried out on dental braces until around the 17th century, although dentistry was making great advancements as a profession by then.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Portrait de Pierre Fauchard dans un livre ancien d'odontologie.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Pierre Fauchard|Fauchard]] from his 1728 edition of ''\"The Surgical Dentist\"''.]]\nOrthodontics truly began developing in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn 1728, French dentist [[Pierre Fauchard]], who is often credited with inventing modern orthodontics, published a book entitled ''\"The Surgeon Dentist\"'' on methods of straightening teeth. Fauchard, in his practice, used a device called a \"Bandeau\", a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that helped expand the palate.\nIn 1754, another French dentist, [[Louis Bourdet]], dentist to the King of France, followed Fauchard's book with ''The Dentist's Art'', which also dedicated a chapter to tooth alignment and application. He perfected the \"Bandeau\" and was the first dentist on record to recommend extraction of the premolar teeth to alleviate crowding and to improve jaw growth.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nAlthough teeth and palate straightening and/or pulling was used to improve alignment of remaining teeth and had been practiced since early times, orthodontics, as a science of its own, did not really exist until the mid-19th century. Several important dentists helped to advance dental braces with specific instruments and tools that allowed braces to be improved.\n\nIn 1819, Delabarre introduced the wire crib, which marked the birth of contemporary orthodontics, and gum elastics were first employed by Maynard in 1843. Tucker was the first to cut rubber bands from rubber tubing in 1850. Dentist, writer, artist, and sculptor [[Norman William Kingsley]] in 1858 wrote the first article on orthodontics and in 1880, his book, ''Treatise on Oral Deformities'', was published. A dentist named [[John Nutting Farrar]] is credited for writing two volumes entitled, ''A Treatise on the Irregularities of the Teeth and Their Corrections'' and was the first to suggest the use of mild force at timed intervals to move teeth.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the early 20th century, [[Edward Angle]] devised the first simple classification system for malocclusions, such as Class I, Class II, and so on. His classification system is still used today as a way for dentists to describe how crooked teeth are, what way teeth are pointing, and how teeth fit together. Angle contributed greatly to the design of orthodontic and dental appliances, making many simplifications. He founded the first school and college of orthodontics, organized the American Society of Orthodontia in 1901 which became the [[American Association of Orthodontists]] (AAO) in the 1930s, and founded the first orthodontic journal in 1907. Other innovations in orthodontics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included the first textbook on orthodontics for children, published by J.J. Guilford in 1889, and the use of rubber elastics, pioneered by [[Calvin Case|Calvin S. Case]], along with [[Henry Albert Baker]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mandibular advancement splint]]\n* [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n* [[Orthognathic surgery]]\n* [[Prosthodontics]]\n* [[Trismus]]\n* [[Dental implant]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commonscatinline}}\n\n{{Orthodontics}}\n\n[[Category:Dental equipment]]\n[[Category:Orthodontic appliances]]\n", "name_user": "Imranalfalah", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePost-treatment)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_braces"}

The player has access to a wide variety of tools, most of which are unlocked by completing jobs and earning experience.

This can be done by purchasing a replacement component or, at higher levels, repairing the existing one. Engines are rendered in a great deal of detail, requiring the player to remove parts in a realistic manner in order to access the relevant component. In order to complete the required task, the player must use realistic hardware like a tire balancer, spring puller, detailing kit and engine mount.\n\nFurther sections of the workroom become unlocked over the course of the game.

Unlike the cars in the base game, which are fictional analogues for real cars, DLC cars are officially licensed replicas. These cars are integrated into the existing game, marked with a \"DLC\" banner in their description.\n\nIn addition to the cars, on October 30, 2017, a free ''Tuning'' DLC was released.

These include a test track which can identify issues with a car's brakes and suspension and a paintshop which is used to paint and customize the car's body.\n\n==Reception==\n\n''Car Mechanic Simulator'' received mixed to positive reviews, holding a 6.8 on Metacritic. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/car-mechanic-simulator-2018|title=Car Mechanic Simulator 2018|website=Metacritic|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>\n\n''[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]'' called the game \"singularly captivating and cathartic\" while criticising a large number of bugs present in the initial release, as well as a number of the design decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/02/car-mechanic-simulator-2018-review-in-progress/|title=Car Mechanic Sim 18: a truly lovely game that you must avoid for now|website=Rock Paper Shotgun|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> A followup review after patching was complete indicated that the technical issues had been resolved. <ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/16/car-mechanic-simulator-2018-patch-review/|title=Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 Patch Review/|website=Rock Paper Shotgun|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe Nintendo Switch version of the game was heavily criticised by ''Nintendo Enthusiast'', who criticised it for being a port of the mobile release, calling it \"a really sad attempt at making a quick buck off of unsuspecting buyers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/2019/02/28/car-mechanic-simulator-switch-review/|title=Car Mechanic Simulator review for Nintendo Switch: Leave it in the scrapyard|website=Nintendo Enthusiast|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>\n\n==Downloadable content==\n\nA variety of [[downloadable content]] is available for ''Car Mechanic Simulator 2018'', the majority of which expands the range of cars available. Unlike the cars in the base game, which are fictional analogues for real cars, DLC cars are officially licensed replicas. These cars are integrated into the existing game, marked with a \"DLC\" banner in their description.\n\nIn addition to the cars, on October 30, 2017, a free ''Tuning'' DLC was released. This expands the number of cosmetic upgrades and high performance parts that can be used to improve the vehicles the player builds.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 15%;height:50px;\" |Name\n! style=\"width: 15%;\" |Release date\n!Cars Added\n|-\n|'''Dodge'''\n|28 July, 2017\n|[[Dodge_Charger#Second_generation_(1968\u20131970)|1968 Dodge Charger]] and [[Dodge_Challenger#First_generation_(1970\u20131974)|1970 Dodge Challenger R/T]]\n|-\n|'''Mazda'''\n|28 July, 2017\n|[[Mazda RX-7|Mazda RX-7 (FD3S)]] and [[Mazda Savanna|1978 Mazda Savanna RX-3]]\n|-\n|'''Jeep'''\n|20 October, 2017\n|[[Jeep Grand Cherokee#Fourth generation (WK2; 2011\u2013present)|Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT]], [[Willys MB|Jeep Willys Military]], [[Willys MB|Jeep Willys Civilian]], [[Jeep Wrangler]]\n|-\n|'''Plymouth'''\n|11 December, 2017\n|[[Plymouth Roadrunner#1970|1970 Plymouth Roadrunner]], [[Plymouth Barracuda#1970\u20131971|1971 Plymouth HEMI Cuda]]\n|-\n|'''Bentley'''\n|29 January, 2018\n|[[Bentley Continental GT#2015 Model year update|2016 Bentley Continental GT Speed]], [[Bentley T-series|1970 Bentley T-Series T1 Four Door Saloon]]\n|-\n|'''Lotus'''\n|05 March, 2018\n|[[Lotus Esprit#S1 (1976)|Lotus Esprit S1]], [[Lotus Elise|Lotus Elise S1]]\n|-\n|'''Pagani'''\n|02 April, 2018\n|[[Pagani Zonda#Zonda Revolucion|Pagani Zonda Revolucion]], [[Pagani Huayra]]\n|-\n|'''Ford'''\n|04 June, 2018 \n|[[Ford_Mustang_Mach_1#First_generation_Mustang_Facelift|1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1]], [[Ford Super Duty#Fourth generation (2017\u2013present)|2017 Ford F-350 Super Duty]], [[Ford Mustang#Sixth generation (2015\u2013present)|2017 Ford Mustang]], [[Ford GT40|1964 Ford GT40]]\n|-\n|'''Porsche'''\n|08 October, 2018\n|[[Porsche 964|1993 PORSCHE 911 Turbo S (964) 3.6]], [[Porsche 964#Carrera RS variants|1993 PORSCHE 911 RS America (964) 3.6]], [[Porsche 911#Second phase (2016\u2013present) (991.2)|2016 PORSCHE 911 Carrera S]]\n|-\n|'''Dodge Modern'''\n|20 December, 2018\n|[[Dodge Challenger#SRT Hellcat|2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat]] and [[Dodge Viper#Phase VX I|2015 Dodge SRT Viper GTS]]\n|-\n|'''Maserati Remastered'''\n|02 March, 2019\n|[[Maserati GranTurismo#GranTurismo MC Stradale (2011\u2013present)|Maserati GranTurismo MC Stradale]], [[Maserati Sebring]] and [[Maserati Quattroporte]]\n|-\n|'''RAM'''\n|10 May, 2019\n|[[Dodge Ram SRT-10]] and [[Ram Pickup#Heavy Duty Chassis Cabs|Dodge Ram 3500]]\n|-\n|'''Mercedes-Benz'''\n|15 January, 2020\n|[[Mercedes-Benz 300 SL|Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Gullwing (W198)]] , [[Mercedes-Benz W126|Mercedes-Benz 560 SEC (W126)]] , [[Mercedes-Benz 500 E|Mercedes-Benz 500E (W124)]] , [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG|Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG (C197)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W113|Mercedes-Benz 280 SL Pagoda (W113)]]\n|-\n|'''Chrysler'''\n|25 March, 2020\n|[[Chrysler 300C SRT8|2008 Chrysler 300C SRT8]] and [[Chrysler Cordoba|1975 Chrysler Cordoba]] \n|-\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2018 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Vehicle simulation games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Poland]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "name_user": "DoctorAlzheimer2", "label": "safe", "comment": "Little change.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Mechanic_Simulator_2018"}
