While they fight, the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical Vice-Admiral Sakazuki, later known as Admiral Akainu. Saulo, on the verge of dying, instructs Robin to flee on his raft. Persuaded by Saulo's argument and Sakazuki's action, Kuzan helps Robin escape. From then on, Robin lives a life on the run, not being able to trust even the kindest of people, in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin. In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy.

But Kumadori uses his Life Return ability to digest the eaten food and regain his usual figure, explaining the ability to a fascinated Chopper before they resume their fight. Chopper quickly realizes that he cannot break through Kumadori's body-hardening technique without the effect of his Rumble Ball drug. Regardless of the risk as he already used one to save Nami and should not take another for six hours, Chopper uses a second Rumble Ball. Despite the erratic transformations, Chopper manages to enter Armed Point to land a hit on Kumadori. However, the attack only infuriated Kumadori as he beats the now weakened Chopper to submission before preparing for the deathblow. But Chopper, remembering Kureha warning him not to take the risk again after learning of the devastation he caused the first time he did it, is left with no recourse but to use a third Rumble Ball with the thought to protect his friends. As a consequence, Chopper transforms into an oversized and purely instinct-driven version of himself that Kureha had best described as a monster.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = One Piece (season 9)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 291\n| Title           = Boss Luffy Returns!

Olvia, who returned to the island on a stolen navy ship, hurries to the Tree of Omniscience to warn her colleagues of a coming navy fleet. However, she is too late. The government ship that carried Spandam's father Spandaine and his men has already arrived. They frighten the island's population into boarding an evacuation ship, while the government soldiers arrest the scholars and search the library. Professor Clover, Robin's mentor, urges Robin to board the evacuation ship, but she refuses. As it becomes clear that the scholars will not be forgiven for their forbidden research, Clover asks to be allowed to speak to the heads of the government, known as the Five Elder Stars.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = One Piece (season 9)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 277\n| Title           = The Tragedy of Ohara!

He describes a civilization that existed hundreds of years ago and vanished at the time that the world government assumed power. He considers the collective evidence, which leads him to believe that the government tried to erase their former enemies from history. After stating that Ohara has learned too much, the Elder Star orders Spandaine to kill the professor and to give the order to destroy the island. Suddenly, the library is set aflame; while the scholars try to save the books, Robin admits to being an archeologist and unites with her mother. However, their union does not last long. Around them, cannon shots from the Buster Call's battleships start to hail down and Olvia sends her daughter off with Saulo to flee the island, while she joins the effort to save the library's knowledge.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = One Piece (season 9)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 278\n| Title           = Say You Want to Live!

She tries to board the evacuation ship, but per Spandaine's orders, she is denied access. Vize-Admiral Kuzan, later known as [[Admiral Aokiji]], enters the scene to engage in battle with Saulo. While they fight, the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical Vice-Admiral Sakazuki, later known as Admiral Akainu. Saulo, on the verge of dying, instructs Robin to flee on his raft. Persuaded by Saulo's argument and Sakazuki's action, Kuzan helps Robin escape. From then on, Robin lives a life on the run, not being able to trust even the kindest of people, in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin. In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy. Finally knowing what kept her away, Sogeking, on Luffy's order, burns the government's flag, declaring war against the World Government itself.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}</onlyinclude>\n|}\n\n===\"Straw Hat Theater & The Straw Hat Pirate Crew\"===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom:3px solid #9C3234\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| No.<ref group=\"n\" name=\"t-ep\"/>\n!

But Kumadori uses his Life Return ability to digest the eaten food and regain his usual figure, explaining the ability to a fascinated Chopper before they resume their fight. Chopper quickly realizes that he cannot break through Kumadori's body-hardening technique without the effect of his Rumble Ball drug. Regardless of the risk as he already used one to save Nami and should not take another for six hours, Chopper uses a second Rumble Ball. Despite the erratic transformations, Chopper manages to enter Armed Point to land a hit on Kumadori. However, the attack only infuriated Kumadori as he beats the now weakened Chopper to submission before preparing for the deathblow. But Chopper, remembering Kureha warning him not to take the risk again after learning of the devastation he caused the first time he did it, is left with no recourse but to use a third Rumble Ball with the thought to protect his friends. As a consequence, Chopper transforms into an oversized and purely instinct-driven version of himself that Kureha had best described as a monster.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = One Piece (season 9)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 291\n| Title           = Boss Luffy Returns!

When the tree disappears the next day, Luffy becomes the prime suspect. Robin investigates. The truth is that Buggy and his men stole the tree and brought it aboard the ship of [[Foxy the Silver Fox]]. She tips off Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji about the tree's location, who go there to retrieve it.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = One Piece (season 9)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 304\n| Title           = I Can't Protect Anyone Unless I Win!

Doberman proceeds to reveal to his men that fifteen years ago, a 13-year-old Rob Lucci is sent as an emissary of the world government to help a country at war with pirates. Prior to his arrival, five hundred of the country's soldiers were taken hostage with the pirates' captain using them to take the king's throne. But allowing himself to be captured, believing that the soldiers are \"guilty of being weak\", Lucci murdered all five hundred hostages before executing the pirate's captain to resolve the matter. Though Doberman's crew were shocked by Lucci's actions, the Vice Admiral voices that is the reason why he is not taking actions in securing Robin as Lucci is suitable for the task. By that time, Luffy makes it to Doberman's ship and proceeds to fight Lucci as Vice Admiral Onigumo orders the ships to redirect their cannons to the gradually damaged vessel.\n| LineColor       = 9C3234\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = One Piece (season 9)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 306\n| Title           = A Mysterious Mermaid Appears?

Since 1972, Greetsiel has been part of the municipality of [[Krummh\u00f6rn]], which has its administrative seat in [[Pewsum]]. The nearest railway station is at [[Emden]], about {{Convert|15|-|20|km|mi}} away, and the two towns are linked by a bus service.\n\nAlthough originally just a small but picturesque fishing village, Greetsiel has become a major tourist attraction. In December 2006, it had 1,534 inhabitants, but the number of people living in the village significantly increases during the summer months and over the Christmas holidays.\n\n== Geography ==\nGreetsiel is situated on the Leybucht, a small bay on the East Frisian coast. Over time, large parts of the bay were reclaimed behind [[levee|dykes]], so that Greetsiel is the only port in the bay today.\n\nIn the 1990s, the ''Leybuchth\u00f6rn'' was completed. This structure extends as a spit out into the [[Wadden Sea]]. Within the ''Leybuchth\u00f6rn'' is a reservoir and the approach channel from the North Sea into Greetsiel Harbour (''Greetsieler Hafen''). Between the port and the open sea is a lock. Since the completion of the structure, Greetsiel Harbour has been accessible from the sea, irrespective of the [[tide]].\n\nThe distance to the nearest towns of [[Emden]] and [[Norden, Lower Saxony|Norden]] is {{Convert|15|-|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north and south respectively.\n\n== History ==\nGreetsiel is first mentioned in the records in letters dating to the year 1388 ([[Ocko I tom Brok]]). At that time, [[Hamburg]]'s [[ship]]s lay at [[anchor]] in the port of Greetsiel and had to pay [[tariff]]s.\n\nThe place was founded by the [[Appingen Abbey|Domain of Appingen]] under the [[East Frisian chiefs|chiefs]] of [[Cirksena]]. While Appingen increasingly lost its importance, Greetsiel became the seat of the chief. In 1462 Count [[Edzard I, Count of East Frisia|Edzard the Great]] was born at the [[Greetsiel Castle|Cirksenaburg]]; under his rule East Frisia extended from the [[River Weser]] as far as [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. In 1547 [[Ubbo Emmius]] was born here. On old Dutch maps the town is marked as ''Grietjezijl''.\n\nIn creating the municipality of Krummh\u00f6rn in 1972, a debate erupted over whether the administrative headquarters should be [[Pewsum]] or Greetsiel. Because Greetsiel was a more isolated location, Pewsum was preferred.\n\n== Culture and points of interest ==\n\n=== Buildings ===\nOf all the East Frisian ''Siel'' villages (a ''Siel'' is a sluice in a dyke), Greetsiel has the best preserved old fishermen's cottages. In its picturesque fishing harbour there are still 28 shrimp cutters (''Krabbenkutter''). Other notable buildings are:\n*''[[Greetsiel Church]]'', an evangelical,reformed church. The rectangular, [[brick]], [[aisleless church]] (''Saalkirche'') was built between 1380 and 1410 as the private church of the chief, Haro Edzardsna, in two stages. In 1401, long before its final completion, it was to be consecrated to [[Saint Mary]]. The building is crowned by a small [[fl\u00e8che]] (''Dachreiter'') decorated with a clock. This is adorned by a 1730 [[weather vane]] in the shape of a ship. The actual clock tower stands off to one side. The simple interior, which at one time had a flat ceiling, has been covered by a slightly vaulted wooden ceiling since 1852. The [[pipe organ|organ]] was completely renovated in 1963, but its [[Pipe organ#Casing|case]] is from 1738; the pulpit, however, had already been made in 1669.\n*''Steinhaus'', the former seat of the Cirksena family. The brick building at the end of the high street (''Hohe Stra\u00dfe'') was built about 1600 on the foundations of a previous building erected around 1390. In the interior the original hall has been restored in the course of renovation work.\n*''Houses''. Among the most famous photographic motifs in Greetsiel is the row of houses on ''Sielstra\u00dfe'' flanking the harbour. The houses at ''No. 11'' and ''No. 15'', with their bell-shaped gables based on Dutch designs, are particularly striking. While the former is dated 1741, No. 15 was built in 1792. The ''Poppingas Old Bakery'' (''Poppingas Alte B\u00e4ckerei''), No. 21, from the 19th  century is also found on ''Sielstra\u00dfe'' and is used now as a museum, cafe and gallery; its interior has been preserved unchanged. Near the church is the so-called High House (''Hohes Haus'') at 1, ''Hohe Stra\u00dfe'', a two-storey, sideways-on, brick building, which once served as the seat of the treasurer or ''Rentmeister''. According to the [[anchor plate]] on the gable it dates to \"1696\", but is thought to have already been in decline by the middle of the 16th century. Today the building, whose street fa\u00e7ade is covered with an ashlar facing, houses a hotel. The ''Amtmannshaus'' on ''Neuer Deich'' is probably from the same period, but was extensively renovated during the 19th century. In the latest renovation the exterior appearance of the house and its associated Gulf barn was changed significantly by the addition of modern [[dormer]]s. In ''M\u00fchlenstra\u00dfe'' is ''Haus von Halem'', built in 1794 and one of the most important residential examples of [[neoclassical architecture]] in East Frisia. The two-storey brick building with a [[hip roof]] is divided by a huge [[pilasters]]. The portal has a richly carved [[fanlight]]s in the late [[rococo]] style.\n\n=== Windmills ===\n[[File:Greetsieler Zwillingsm\u00fchlen 2010.jpg|right|thumb]]\n{{coord|53.497586|7.100105|display=inline|type:landmark_region:DE}}\n\nThe twin windmills ({{lang-de|Zwillingsm\u00fchlen}}) of Greetsiel-West date from 1856 (green) and Greetsiel-Ost from 1706 (red, renovated in 1921 with parts of [[Aurich]]'s ''Wallm\u00fchle'' mill of 1750). They are smock mills ({{lang-de|Holl\u00e4nderwindm\u00fchlen}}).\n\n=== Other places of interest ===\nOther places of interest include the [[scoop wheel]], the old ''Siel'' (1798), the new ''Siel'' (1887) and the [[Pilsum Lighthouse]].  Greetsiel also hosts the largest [[ship in a bottle]] museum in Germany and Europe, with about 800 examples.<ref>[http://www.greetsiel.de/tourismus/interessen/kunst-kultur/greetsieler-museumshaus.html greetsiel.de: ''Museumshaus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323123348/http://www.greetsiel.de/tourismus/interessen/kunst-kultur/greetsieler-museumshaus.html |date=2012-03-23 }}, accessed on 2 June 2011.</ref>  Of all the places in the municipality of Krummh\u00f6rn, Greetsiel has the highest influx of tourists.\n\n=== Regular events ===\nAn annual painting and art exhibition, known as Greetsiel Week (''[http://www.greetsieler-woche.de Greetsieler Woche]''), is of national prominence. It has been running for more than 30 years and exhibits a range of works including: art, ceramics, goldsmiths' products and sculptures. Every two years, the [[Imke Folkerts Prize for Fine Arts]], worth 10,000 euros, is awarded at the event.<ref>[http://www.imke-folkerts-preis.de/imke-folkerts-prize/home-en.html Imke Folkerts Prize for Fine Arts], accessed on 6 January 2013.</ref> Qualifying entries include works in the fields of art, graphics, photography and sculpture. There are also regular exhibitions in Greetsiel's twin windmills. Every year in mid-summer is the [[shrimp boat|boat parade]] in which the majority of Greetsiel's cutters take part. The crews take guests on a roughly four-hour boat trip. The port also hosts a supporting programme of events with music and shrimp-shelling competitions.<ref>[http://www.greetsiel.de/tourismus/interessen/fischer-hafen-nordseekrabben/kutterkorso.html greetsiel.de: ''Kutterkorso''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323123404/http://www.greetsiel.de/tourismus/interessen/fischer-hafen-nordseekrabben/kutterkorso.html |date=2012-03-23 }}, accessed on 2 June 2011</ref>\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Empfangsgeb\u00e4udeGreetsiel-06072009.jpg|thumb|Former railway station buildings]]\nGreetsiel is linked by state roads to Norden and Emden and from there the [[Bundesautobahn 31|A 31]].\n\nAt one time the [[Emden-Pewsum-Greetsiel light railway]] linked Pewsum and Greetsiel with Emden. The operation of the {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} gauge railway began in 1899 between Emden and Pewsum and, in 1906, the line was extended to Greetsiel. ''Kleinbahnstra\u00dfe'' in Greetsiel recalls that period, along which there are still several railway buildings that are now used for other purposes. The narrow-gauge railway was closed in 1963; since when passenger services have been taken over by [[bus]]es. Today, Greetsiel is connected by bus with the former county town of [[Norden, Lower Saxony|Norden]] as well as Emden.\n\nGreetsiel can also be reached by smaller boats from the direction of Emden. The ''Alte Greetsieler Sieltief'' and the ''Neue Greetsieler Sieltief'' connect the port with the East Frisian inland waterways network.\n\n== Images ==\n{{commons category}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Greetsiel harbour.jpg|Greetsiel harbour\nFile:Greetsiel landscape 2003 05.jpg|The landscape to the north of Greetsiel.\nFile:Greetsieler Zwillingsm\u00fchlen 2010.jpg|The twin windmills, seen from the west\nFile:Zwillingsm\u00fchlen von Greetsiel.jpg|The twin mills, Greetsiel-Ost in front\nFile:port_greetsiel.jpg|Greetsiel Harbour\nFile:emmius_geboortehuis.jpg|Birthplace of Ubbo Emmius in Greetsiel\nFile:Greetsiel 04.jpg|Shrimp cutters in the harbour\nFile:Greetsiel 13.jpg|''Sielstra\u00dfe''\nFile:Greetsiel 17.jpg|''Sielstra\u00dfe''\nFile:Greetsiel Skelettierter-Fisch 0334.jpg|Sculpture at the harbour exit\nFile:Anker greetsiel.jpg|Old anchor \nFile:Greetsiel Hafen.jpg|Cutters in the harbour\nFile:Hafen Greetsiel.JPG|The harbour from Greetsiel\nFile:GreetsielHafen1-28062009.JPG|Greetsiel Harbour (2009)\nFile:GreetsielHafen2-28062009.JPG|Greetsiel Harbour (2009)\n</gallery>\n\n== Sons of the village ==\nUbbo Emmius, born 5&nbsp;December 1547, was a theologian, historian, pedagogue and first master of the [[University of Groningen]] ([[Netherlands]]).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Greetsiel}}\n* [http://www.greetsiel.de/ Internet page for Greetsiel] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Municipality of Krummh\u00f6rn}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Lower Saxony]]\n[[Category:Towns and villages in East Frisia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox German location\n|name=Greetsiel\n|type = Ortsteil\n|district=Aurich\n|Municipality=Krummh\u00f6rn\n|image_coa=Wappen Greetsiel.jpg\n|coordinates = {{coord|53|29|55|N|07|05|53|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|state=Niedersachsen\n|elevation=0\n|H\u00f6he-bis=1\n|H\u00f6he-Bezug=DE-NN\n|area=\n|population=1534\n|Stand=2006-12-31\n|Eingemeindungsdatum=\n|postal_code=26736\n|area_code=04926\n}}\n\n'''Greetsiel''' is a small [[seaport|port]] on the bight of [[Leybucht]] in western [[East Frisia]], [[Germany]] that was first documented in letters from the year 1388.
