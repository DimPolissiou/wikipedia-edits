There are techniques and benefits to using one modality over another. Utilization of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is generally recommended when the hands are not visibly soiled or before and after contact with a person (e.g. patient in a healthcare setting), or object. With proper technique, soap and water is preferred for visibly soiled hands or in situations where hands various pathogens cannot be killed with alcohol-based hand sanitizers (e.g. spore producing organisms like clostridium difficile)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/providers/index.html|title=Healthcare Providers {{!}} Hand Hygiene {{!}} CDC|date=2020-02-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n* PPE in cases of infectious material exposure etiquette,\n* respiratory hygiene principles,\n* patient isolation controls,\n* soiled equipment handling,\n* and injection handling. \n\n==History of guidelines for isolation precautions in hospitals<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Year\n| Document issued\n| Comment\n|-\n| 1970<ref>National Communicable Disease Center.

Melded major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation into standard precautions to be used with all patients at all times. Included three transmission-based precaution categories: airborne, droplet, and contact . Listed clinical syndromes that should dictate use of empiric isolation until an etiological diagnosis is established.\n|}\n\n==Rationale for use in healthcare setting==\nCommunicable diseases occur as a result of the interaction between:\n* a source (or reservoir) of infectious agents,\n* a mode of transmission for the agent,\n* a susceptible host with a portal of entry receptive to the agent,\n* the environment.\nThe control of communicable diseases may involve changing one or more of these components, the first three of which are influenced by the environment. These diseases can have a wide range of effects, varying from silent infection \u2013 with no signs or symptoms \u2013 to severe illness and death. According to its nature, a certain infectious agent may demonstrate one or more following modes of transmission:\n* direct and indirect contact transmission,\n* droplet transmission and\n* airborne transmission.<ref>Bonita, Ruth et al.. Basic epidemiology. 2nd edition. World Health Organization. 226 p., 2006</ref>\nTransmission-based precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission is (are) not completely interrupted using standard precautions alone.\nThree categories of transmission-based precautions are designed with respect to the modes of transmission:\n* Contact precautions,\n* Droplet precautions, and\n* Airborne precautions.\nFor some diseases that have multiple routes of transmission (e.g., SARS), more than one transmission-based precautions category may be used. When used either singly or in combination, they are always used in addition to standard precautions.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nWhen transmission-based precautions are indicated, efforts must be made to counteract possible adverse effects on patients (i.e., anxiety, depression and other mood disturbances,<ref>Catalano G, Houston SH, Catalano MC, et al.

The specific agents and circumstance for which contact precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A \nof the Guidance.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> The application of contact precautions for patients infected or colonized with MDROs is described in the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms In Healthcare Settings, 2006. 2006. www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf</ref> Contact precautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission. A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require contact precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multi-patient rooms, >3&nbsp;feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on contact precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning PPE upon room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (e.g., VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens; RSV)<ref>Donskey CJ.

Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which droplet precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A and include ''[[Bordetella pertussis|B. pertussis]]'', [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]], [[adenovirus]], [[rhinovirus]], ''[[Neisseria meningitidis|N. meningitidis]]'', and [[Streptococcus pyogenes|group A streptococcus]] (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single patient room is preferred for patients who require droplet precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Spatial separation of > 3&nbsp;feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on droplet precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.\n\n===Airborne precautions===\n[[File:Airborne Precautions poster.pdf|thumb|Airborne precautions poster]]\n\nAirborne precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], ''M. tuberculosis'', and possibly SARS-CoV). The preferred placement for patients who require airborne precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area,<ref>CDC. Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care settings, 2005. MMWR Recomm Rep 2005;54(17):1-141.</ref> air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities, air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return).<ref>AIA. Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities. In: American Institute of Architects. Washington, DC: American Institute of Architects Press; 2006.</ref> Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with ''M. tuberculosis''. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, [[Respirator fit test|fit-testing]], and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where airborne precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on airborne precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (Appendix A),<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> that is donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox).\n\n==Syndromic and empirical use==\nSince the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a healthcare facility, transmission-based precautions are used empirically, according to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time, and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible infectious etiology is ruled out.\nDiagnosis of many infections requires laboratory confirmation. Since laboratory tests, especially those that depend on culture techniques, often require two or more days for completion, transmission-based precautions must be implemented while test results are pending based on the clinical presentation and likely pathogens. Use of appropriate transmission-based precautions at the time a patient develops symptoms or signs of transmissible infection, or arrives at a healthcare facility for care, reduces transmission opportunities. While it is not possible to identify prospectively all patients needing transmission-based precautions, certain clinical syndromes and conditions carry a sufficiently high risk to warrant their use empirically while confirmatory tests are pending.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Clinical syndrome or condition\u00b9\n| Potential pathogens\u00b2\n| Empiric precautions (always include standard precautions)\n|-\n| Acute diarrhea with a likely infectious cause in an incontinent or diapered patient\n| Enteric pathogens include enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7, ''Shigella'' spp, hepatitis A virus, noroviruses, rotavirus, ''C. difficile''\n| Contact precautions (pediatrics and adult)\n|-\n|Meningitis\n| ''Neisseria meningitidis''\n| Droplet precautions for first 24 hrs of antimicrobial therapy; mask and face protection for intubation\n|-\n|Meningitis\n|Enteroviruses ''M. tuberculosis''\n| Contact precautions for infants and children\n|-\n|Meningitis\n|''M. tuberculosis''\n| Airborne precautions if pulmonary infiltrate\nAirborne precautions plus contact precautions if potentially infectious draining body fluid present\n|-\n|RASH OR EXANTHEMS, GENERALIZED, ETIOLOGY UNKNOWN\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Petechial]]/[[ecchymotic]] with fever (general)\n|''Neisseria meningitidis''\n| Droplet precautions for first 24 hrs of antimicrobial therapy\n|-\n|Ebola, Lassa, Marburg viruses\n| Droplet precautions plus contact precautions, with face/eye protection, emphasizing safety sharps and barrier precautions when blood exposure likely.

It may be prudent to assume that MDRO carriers are colonized permanently and manage them accordingly. Alternatively, an interval free of hospitalizations, antimicrobial therapy, and invasive devices (e.g., 6 or 12 months) before reculturing patients to document clearance of carriage may be used. Determination of the best strategy awaits the results of additional studies. See the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> for discussion of possible criteria to discontinue contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with MDROs.\n\n==Application in ambulatory and home care settings==\nAlthough transmission-based precautions generally apply in all healthcare settings, exceptions exist. For example, in home care, AIIRs are not available. Furthermore, family members already exposed to diseases such as varicella and tuberculosis would not use masks or respiratory protection, but visiting HCWs would need to use such protection. Similarly, management of patients colonized or infected with MDROs may necessitate contact precautions in acute care hospitals and in some LTCFs when there is continued transmission, but the risk of transmission in ambulatory care and home care, has not been defined. Consistent use of standard precautions may suffice in these settings, but more information is needed.\n\nPatients requiring outpatient services with known airborne or droplet transmitted diseases should be scheduled at the end of the day to minimize exposure to other patients. These patients should also be educated on proper respiratory etiquette - coughing into their elbow and wearing a mask.\u00a0 Healthcare professionals should also wear proper PPE when anticipating contact with these patients.\n\nPatients with known contact transmitted diseases coming into ambulatory clinics should be triaged quickly and placed in a private room.\u00a0 Items used in these rooms should not be taken out of the room unless properly sanitized.  Healthcare workers must practice proper hand hygiene when exiting the private room. \u00a0\n\nPatients placed in long-term care facilities should be placed in single rooms, have access to their own items or use disposable items, and should have limited contact with other residents, in order to reduce the spread of contact transmitted diseases. \u00a0For patients with airborne and droplet transmitted diseases in long-term care facilities, they should wear masks when around other residents, and proper PPE and standard precautions should be maintained throughout facilities.\u00a0 In addition, residents of long-term care facilities who are identified as at-risk for these diseases should be immunized if possible. \n\nFootnotes:{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Health care}}\n\n[[Category:Epidemiology]]\n[[Category:Medical hygiene]]\n[[Category:Infectious diseases]]\n[[Category:Prevention]]\n", "text_old": "{{See|Isolation (health care)}}\n\n'''Transmission-based precautions''' are additional [[infection control|infection-control]] precautions in health care, and the latest routine infection prevention and control practices applied for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with [[infectious agents]], including certain [[Epidemiology|epidemiologically]] important [[pathogen]]s.

Hand hygiene can be accomplished with different modalities including alcohol-based hand sanitizers, soap and water, or antiseptic hand wash. There are techniques and benefits to using one modality over another. Utilization of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is generally recommended when the hands are not visibly soiled or before and after contact with a person (e.g. patient in a healthcare setting), or object. With proper technique, soap and water is preferred for visibly soiled hands or in situations where hands various pathogens cannot be killed with alcohol-based hand sanitizers (e.g. spore producing organisms like clostridium difficile)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/providers/index.html|title=Healthcare Providers {{!}} Hand Hygiene {{!}} CDC|date=2020-02-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n* PPE in cases of infectious material exposure etiquette,\n* respiratory hygiene principles,\n* patient isolation controls,\n* soiled equipment handling,\n* and injection handling. \n\n==History of guidelines for isolation precautions in hospitals<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Year\n| Document issued\n| Comment\n|-\n| 1970<ref>National Communicable Disease Center.

Listed clinical syndromes that should dictate use of empiric isolation until an etiological diagnosis is established.\n|}\n\n==Rationale for use in healthcare setting==\nCommunicable diseases occur as a result of the interaction between:\n* a source (or reservoir) of infectious agents,\n* a mode of transmission for the agent,\n* a susceptible host with a portal of entry receptive to the agent,\n* the environment.\nThe control of communicable diseases may involve changing one or more of these components, the first three of which are influenced by the environment. These diseases can have a wide range of effects, varying from silent infection \u2013 with no signs or symptoms \u2013 to severe illness and death. According to its nature, a certain infectious agent may demonstrate one or more following modes of transmission:\n* direct and indirect contact transmission,\n* droplet transmission and\n* airborne transmission.<ref>Bonita, Ruth et al.. Basic epidemiology. 2nd edition. World Health Organization. 226 p., 2006</ref>\nTransmission-based precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission is (are) not completely interrupted using standard precautions alone.\nThree categories of transmission-based precautions are designed with respect to the modes of transmission:\n* Contact precautions,\n* Droplet precautions, and\n* Airborne precautions.\nFor some diseases that have multiple routes of transmission (e.g., SARS), more than one transmission-based precautions category may be used. When used either singly or in combination, they are always used in addition to standard precautions.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n\nWhen transmission-based precautions are indicated, efforts must be made to counteract possible adverse effects on patients (i.e., anxiety, depression and other mood disturbances,<ref>Catalano G, Houston SH, Catalano MC, et al.

The specific agents and circumstance for which contact precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A \nof the Guidance.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> The application of contact precautions for patients infected or colonized with MDROs is described in the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms In Healthcare Settings, 2006. 2006. www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf</ref> Contact precautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission. A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require contact precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multi-patient rooms, >3&nbsp;feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on contact precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning PPE upon room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (e.g., VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens; RSV)<ref>Donskey CJ.

MMWR Recomm Rep 1995;44 (RR12):1-13.</ref>\n\n===Droplet precautions===\n[[File:Droplet Precautions poster.pdf|thumb|Droplet precautions poster]]\n\nDroplet precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions, namely [[respiratory droplet]]s. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which droplet precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A and include ''[[Bordetella pertussis|B. pertussis]]'', [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]], [[adenovirus]], [[rhinovirus]], ''[[Neisseria meningitidis|N. meningitidis]]'', and [[Streptococcus pyogenes|group A streptococcus]] (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single patient room is preferred for patients who require droplet precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Spatial separation of > 3&nbsp;feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on droplet precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.\n\n===Airborne precautions===\n[[File:Airborne Precautions poster.pdf|thumb|Airborne precautions poster]]\n\nAirborne precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], ''M. tuberculosis'', and possibly SARS-CoV). The preferred placement for patients who require airborne precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area,<ref>CDC. Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care settings, 2005. MMWR Recomm Rep 2005;54(17):1-141.</ref> air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities, air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return).<ref>AIA. Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities. In: American Institute of Architects. Washington, DC: American Institute of Architects Press; 2006.</ref> Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with ''M. tuberculosis''. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, [[Respirator fit test|fit-testing]], and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where airborne precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on airborne precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (Appendix A),<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> that is donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox).\n\n==Syndromic and empirical use<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/> ==\nSince the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a healthcare facility, transmission-based precautions are used empirically, according to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time, and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible infectious etiology is ruled out.\nDiagnosis of many infections requires laboratory confirmation. Since laboratory tests, especially those that depend on culture techniques, often require two or more days for completion, transmission-based precautions must be implemented while test results are pending based on the clinical presentation and likely pathogens. Use of appropriate transmission-based precautions at the time a patient develops symptoms or signs of transmissible infection, or arrives at a healthcare facility for care, reduces transmission opportunities. While it is not possible to identify prospectively all patients needing transmission-based precautions, certain clinical syndromes and conditions carry a sufficiently high risk to warrant their use empirically while confirmatory tests are pending.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Clinical syndrome or condition\u00b9\n| Potential pathogens\u00b2\n| Empiric precautions (always include standard precautions)\n|-\n| Acute diarrhea with a likely infectious cause in an incontinent or diapered patient\n| Enteric pathogens include enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7, ''Shigella'' spp, hepatitis A virus, noroviruses, rotavirus, ''C. difficile''\n| Contact precautions (pediatrics and adult)\n|-\n|Meningitis\n| ''Neisseria meningitidis''\n| Droplet precautions for first 24 hrs of antimicrobial therapy; mask and face protection for intubation\n|-\n|Meningitis\n|Enteroviruses ''M. tuberculosis''\n| Contact precautions for infants and children\n|-\n|Meningitis\n|''M. tuberculosis''\n| Airborne precautions if pulmonary infiltrate\nAirborne precautions plus contact precautions if potentially infectious draining body fluid present\n|-\n|RASH OR EXANTHEMS, GENERALIZED, ETIOLOGY UNKNOWN\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Petechial]]/[[ecchymotic]] with fever (general)\n|''Neisseria meningitidis''\n| Droplet precautions for first 24 hrs of antimicrobial therapy\n|-\n|Ebola, Lassa, Marburg viruses\n| Droplet precautions plus contact precautions, with face/eye protection, emphasizing safety sharps and barrier precautions when blood exposure likely.

For some diseases (e.g., pharyngeal or cutaneous diphtheria, RSV), transmission-based precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases, (e.g., ''M. tuberculosis'') state laws and regulations, and healthcare facility policies, may dictate the duration of precautions 12). In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2002\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>Zambon M, Bull T, Sadler CJ, Goldman JM, Ward KN.

It may be prudent to assume that MDRO carriers are colonized permanently and manage them accordingly. Alternatively, an interval free of hospitalizations, antimicrobial therapy, and invasive devices (e.g., 6 or 12 months) before reculturing patients to document clearance of carriage may be used. Determination of the best strategy awaits the results of additional studies. See the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/> for discussion of possible criteria to discontinue contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with MDROs.\n\n==Application in ambulatory and home care settings==\nAlthough transmission-based precautions generally apply in all healthcare settings, exceptions exist. For example, in home care, AIIRs are not available. Furthermore, family members already exposed to diseases such as varicella and tuberculosis would not use masks or respiratory protection, but visiting HCWs would need to use such protection. Similarly, management of patients colonized or infected with MDROs may necessitate contact precautions in acute care hospitals and in some LTCFs when there is continued transmission, but the risk of transmission in ambulatory care and home care, has not been defined. Consistent use of standard precautions may suffice in these settings, but more information is needed.\n\nPatients requiring outpatient services with known airborne or droplet transmitted diseases should be scheduled at the end of the day to minimize exposure to other patients. These patients should also be educated on proper respiratory etiquette - coughing into their elbow and wearing a mask.\u00a0 Healthcare professionals should also wear proper PPE when anticipating contact with these patients.\n\nPatients with known contact transmitted diseases coming into ambulatory clinics should be triaged quickly and placed in a private room.\u00a0 Items used in these rooms should not be taken out of the room unless properly sanitized.  Healthcare workers must practice proper hand hygiene when exiting the private room. \u00a0\n\nPatients placed in long-term care facilities should be placed in single rooms, have access to their own items or use disposable items, and should have limited contact with other residents, in order to reduce the spread of contact transmitted diseases. \u00a0For patients with airborne and droplet transmitted diseases in long-term care facilities, they should wear masks when around other residents, and proper PPE and standard precautions should be maintained throughout facilities.\u00a0 In addition, residents of long-term care facilities who are identified as at-risk for these diseases should be immunized if possible. \n\nFootnotes:{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Health care}}\n\n[[Category:Epidemiology]]\n[[Category:Medical hygiene]]\n[[Category:Infectious diseases]]\n[[Category:Prevention]]\n", "name_user": "Wuerzele", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSyndromic and empirical use:Fixing style/layout errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission-based_precautions"}
