She is a [[lyric soprano]] and has a [[vocal range]] of three octaves.<ref name=\"Classic Rock Magazine 2009, p. 92\">Classic Rock Magazine, August 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nTurunen studied singing at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Karlsruhe]]. She is a professional classical [[lied]] singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]], which she founded with [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Emppu Vuorinen]] in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's [[End of an Era (album)|End of an Era]] concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called ''[[Henk\u00e4ys ikuisuudesta]]''. In 2007, Turunen released ''[[My Winter Storm]]'', an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the [[Storm World Tour]]. Turunen released her third album, ''[[What Lies Beneath (Tarja album)|What Lies Beneath]]'', in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and the [[Wacken Open Air]], before starting the [[What Lies Beneath World Tour]], which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in [[Rosario, Argentina]]. ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was released in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarja-act1.com/?p=341#more-341 |title=Tarja Turunen \u2013 Live Album 'ACT I\" available August 24th 2012 |website=Tarja-act1.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> Turunen started the [[Colours in the Dark World Tour]] in October 2013 to promote her new album [[Colours in the Dark (album)|''Colours in the Dark'']]. Her second live DVD was filmed during the events of ''[[Beauty and the Beat (Tarja album)|Beauty and the Beat]]'' and was released in May.\n\nIn September 2015, Tarja Turunen released her first classical studio album, ''[[Ave Maria \u2013 En Plein Air]]''. In August 2016 she released ''[[The Shadow Self (album)|The Shadow Self]]'' with a prequel EP ''[[The Brightest Void (album)|The Brightest Void]]'' released on June 3. Her latest album ''[[In the Raw (Tarja album)|In the Raw]]'', was released in August 30, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tarjaturunen.com/albums-in-the-raw/|title=Tarja Turunen &#124; ALBUMS / IN THE RAW|accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tarja-intheraw.com/|title=Tarja - In The Raw - The New Studio Album OUT NOW|website=www.tarja-intheraw.com|accessdate=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===1977\u20131995: Early life===\nTarja Turunen was born in the small village of Puhos, near [[Kitee]], Finland. She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \"Enkeli taivaan\" (the Finnish version of \"[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|From Heaven Above to Earth I Come]]\") in the Kitee church hall at age three.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} She joined the [[church choir]] and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt [[comprehensive school]], Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\"{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} Her music teacher, [[Plamen Dimov (musician)|Plamen Dimov]], later explained that, \"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\".{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At school she had a tough time, since some girls [[Bullying|bullied]] her because they envied her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in [[Savonlinna]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=43}}\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including [[soul music]] by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42, 43}} Later she listened to songs from the [[Crossover (music)#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singer [[Sarah Brightman]], especially the song \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\", and decided to focus on that genre of music.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At eighteen, she moved to [[Kuopio]] to study at the [[Sibelius Academy]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=44}}\n\n===1996\u20132005: Nightwish===\n[[File:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Five band members taking their bows at the end of a performance|Turunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], Finland, on June 25, 2005]]\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate [[Tuomas Holopainen]] invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, [[Emppu Vuorinen]] used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=45, 46}} Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a [[Heavy metal music|metal band]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=54}}\n\nNightwish recorded a second demo with \"more bombastic, dramatic\" songs in September 1997. Holopainen used this material to convince the Finnish label [[Spinefarm Records]] to publish the band's debut album, ''[[Angels Fall First]]''.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=52, 53}} The success of the first album came as a surprise to the label.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=52}} As the album hit the top 40 of the Finnish charts,<ref name=\"nw fin charts\">{{cite web|url=http://finnishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Nightwish&titel=Angels+Fall+First&cat=a|title=Nightwish- Angels Fall First (album)|publisher= Hung Medien |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}</ref> Nightwish started their tour [[The First Tour of the Angels]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=59}} That same year, Turunen performed at the [[Savonlinna Opera Festival]] for the first time, singing songs from [[Wagner]] and [[Verdi]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=65}}[[File:Nightwish.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Four band members perform before a live audience|Turunen with Nightwish in [[Kitee]], Finland, on May 22, 2004]]\n\nDue to her commitment to the band, Turunen was not able to concentrate sufficiently on her schoolwork and her academic studies were interrupted.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=69}} In 1998, Nightwish published their second album, ''[[Oceanborn]]''.

In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=115}}<ref name=\"MetalH\">[[Metal Hammer]], July 2002, p. 21</ref> While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish's 2002 album ''[[Century Child]]'' and for [[Beto V\u00e1zquez Infinity]]. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.<ref name=\"MetalH\" />\n\nIn 2002, Turunen toured South America, performing in the classical [[Lied]] concert ''Noche Escandinava'' (''Scandinavian Night'') to sold-out houses. Following this and an exhausting world tour in support of ''Century Child'' (the [[World Tour of the Century]]), Nightwish took a hiatus and Turunen returned to Karlsruhe to finish her studies.

On the Nightwish album ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998), her classical vocal training was much more noticeable. For the song \"[[Passion and the Opera]]\", Turunen performed a [[staccato]] [[coloratura]] reminiscent of the aria \"[[Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Hell's vengeance boils in my heart]]\", sung by the soprano role Queen of the Night in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] opera [[The Magic Flute]].{{sfn|Della Ciopa|2010|p=77}} \"Sleeping Sun\" required a well-trained breathing technique.

In an interview with ''Breakout'' magazine, she reported that in the studio, the band members were shaken by a paroxysm of laughter as she tried to warm up for the vocal lines.<ref>''Breakout'' Magazine, 5/2001, p. 6-8</ref> As a side benefit of her efforts, Turunen gradually expanded her vocal range considerably into the lower range, which manifested even more on the following albums.\n\nFor the album ''[[Century Child]]'' (2002), she experimented with a more \"rock\" sounding voice, where she maintained the classical singing technique, but, for example, sang with less vibrato.

She is a [[lyric soprano]] and has a [[vocal range]] of three octaves.<ref name=\"Classic Rock Magazine 2009, p. 92\">Classic Rock Magazine, August 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nTurunen studied singing at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Karlsruhe]]. She is a professional classical [[lied]] singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]], which she founded with [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Emppu Vuorinen]] in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's [[End of an Era (album)|End of an Era]] concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called ''[[Henk\u00e4ys ikuisuudesta]]''. In 2007, Turunen released ''[[My Winter Storm]]'', an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the [[Storm World Tour]]. Turunen released her third album, ''[[What Lies Beneath (Tarja album)|What Lies Beneath]]'', in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and the [[Wacken Open Air]], before starting the [[What Lies Beneath World Tour]], which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in [[Rosario, Argentina]]. ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was released in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarja-act1.com/?p=341#more-341 |title=Tarja Turunen \u2013 Live Album 'ACT I\" available August 24th 2012 |website=Tarja-act1.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> Turunen started the [[Colours in the Dark World Tour]] in October 2013 to promote her new album [[Colours in the Dark (album)|''Colours in the Dark'']].

She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \"Enkeli taivaan\" (the Finnish version of \"[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|From Heaven Above to Earth I Come]]\") in the Kitee church hall at age three.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} She joined the [[church choir]] and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt [[comprehensive school]], Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\"{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} Her music teacher, [[Plamen Dimov (musician)|Plamen Dimov]], later explained that, \"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\".{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At school she had a tough time, since some girls [[Bullying|bullied]] her because they envied her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in [[Savonlinna]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=43}}\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including [[soul music]] by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42, 43}} Later she listened to songs from the [[Crossover (music)#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singer [[Sarah Brightman]], especially the song \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\", and decided to focus on that genre of music.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At eighteen, she moved to [[Kuopio]] to study at the [[Sibelius Academy]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=44}}\n\n===1996\u20132005: Nightwish===\n[[File:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Five band members taking their bows at the end of a performance|Turunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], Finland, on June 25, 2005]]\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate [[Tuomas Holopainen]] invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, [[Emppu Vuorinen]] used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=45, 46}} Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a [[Heavy metal music|metal band]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=54}}\n\nNightwish recorded a second demo with \"more bombastic, dramatic\" songs in September 1997.

In non-bloom conditions, zooplankton consumption by jellyfish was <1% of the annual zooplankton stock.<ref name=\":24\" />\n\nImportantly, jellyfish blooms do not always directly result in depletion of zooplankton and other competing mid-trophic species. Jellyfish blooms can have a more complicated role in food web dynamics and overall estuary health. In the case of [[Chesapeake Bay]], sea nettles (''[[Chrysaora quinquecirrha]]'') served as a dominant top-down control within the [[Estuary|estuarine]] ecosystem and were tightly coupled with [[oyster]] populations.<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite journal|last=Breitburg|first=Denise L.|last2=Fulford|first2=Richard S.|date=2006-10-01|title=Oyster-sea nettle interdependence and altered control within the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem|journal=Estuaries and Coasts|language=en|volume=29|issue=5|pages=776\u2013784|doi=10.1007/BF02786528|issn=1559-2731}}</ref> Seasonal blooms of sea nettles were partially dependent on oyster populations as oysters provided the most extensive hard [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] in Chesapeake Bay, which was critical for the [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] stage of sea nettle development.

This ultimately exacerbated the decline of both sea nettle and oyster populations.<ref name=\":26\" />\n\nIncrease in jellyfish predation on zooplankton during blooms can also alter [[Food web|trophic pathways]]. Consumption by small and large gelatinous zooplankton interrupts energy transfer of zooplankton production to upper trophic levels.<ref name=\":23\" /> Since jellyfish have few predators (large [[pelagic fish]] and [[sea turtle]]s), jellyfish production does not transfer efficiently to higher trophic levels and can become a \"trophic dead-end\".<ref name=\":23\" />\n\n=== Impacts on biochemical processes ===\nJellyfish blooms may alter [[Nutrient cycle|elemental cycling]] of [[carbon]](C), [[nitrogen]] (N), and [[phosphorus]] (P) in the ocean. As jellyfish populations increase they consume organic material containing C, N, and P, becoming a net sink of organic compounds.<ref name=\":6\" /> Through their rapid growth, jellyfish may therefore reduce the organic material available for other organisms. Since their gelatinous bodies are not consumed by many higher trophic level organisms, jellyfish limit the trophic transfer of energy and C, N, and P up the food chain, instead shifting the trophic transfer to the [[Microbial population biology|microbial community]].<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":10\"/>\n\nJellyfish can be one of the largest stores of biomass in the [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] community during blooms; this makes them an important source of organic C, N, and P.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":10\"/> Large populations of jellyfish also mobilize inorganic C, N, and P by moving to different regions and emitting them through [[excretion]], [[Mucus|mucus production]], or [[decomposition]].<ref name=\":6\" /> One contingency on how jellyfish blooms affect their environment depends on whether they possess the symbiotic algae called [[zooxanthellae]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Jellyfish with zooxanthellae obtain organic C, N, and P through [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] from their symbiont, incorporating inorganic nutrients through photosynthesis. Zooxanthellae give jellyfish an advantage when organic matter is in short supply, by producing their own nutrients, also creating competition with [[primary producers]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Zooxanthellate jellyfish also translocate inorganic N and P back to their symbionts rather than excreting it into the water. Alternatively, jellyfish without zooxanthellae are heterotrophic and acquire most of their C, N, and P by ingesting [[zooplankton]]. After they consume zooplankton, these jellyfish release dissolved organic and inorganic forms of C, N, and P back into the environment.

In the case of farmed salmon, exposure to jellyfish was correlated with potentially fatal gill damage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Emily J.|last2=Sturt|first2=Michael M.|last3=Ruane|first3=Neil M.|last4=Doyle|first4=Thomas K.|last5=McAllen|first5=Rob|last6=Harman|first6=Luke|last7=Rodger|first7=Hamish D.|date=2011-04-07|title=Gill Damage to Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Caused by the Common Jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) under Experimental Challenge|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e18529|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018529|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3072396|pmid=21490977|bibcode=2011PLoSO...618529B}}</ref>\n\n=== Industry ===\nPower plants are often built on coasts and draw seawater for industrial cooling water. Jellyfish can clog the water intakes of power plants, which can decrease energy production or cause shutdowns.<ref name=\":19\" /> While total shutdown due to jellyfish clogging is uncommon, revenue losses can be significant. In some estimates, revenue losses are up to 5.5 million [[Indian rupee]]s (US${{To USD round| 5500000 | IND | sf=2 }}) per day during a shutdown.<ref name=\":19\" /> Not all clogs lead to shutdowns, though even minor intake perturbations can result in lost revenue. Some measures are available to prevent jellyfish-related interruptions. Power plants in Japan use bubble-curtain devices which produce air bubbles near intake valves which lift the jellyfish, reducing the number that are sucked into the pumps.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:Diver and jellyfish, Jellyfish Lake, Palau Islands, Micronesia.jpg|thumb|225x225px|A diver swimming among jellyfish.  |alt=Although this variety is benign, blooms of other species complicate activities such as diving.|left]]\nIn coastal areas where [[tourism]] is ubiquitous, jellyfish blooms often present a risk to recreational activities due to beach closures and stinging swimmers.<ref name=\":0\" /> During blooms, the incidence of jellyfish stings becomes much more common. In parts of the Mediterranean Sea the problem has been very pronounced. For example, in the Mediterranean town of Solento, Italy, there were over 1,700 sting incidents requiring medical attention between 2007 and 2011.<ref name=\":9\" /> Stings were more commonly reported when wind conditions were blowing perpendicular to shore, which generally brought jellyfish into closer proximity with tourists.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThough stings and beach closures may be affect tourism, attitudes about the presence of jellyfish may not affect behavior. A study surveying beach goers in Israel found that only between 3\u201310% said jellyfish blooms would be a factor causing them to cancel a beach trip.<ref name=\":25\">{{Cite journal|last=Ghermandi|first=Andrea|last2=Galil|first2=Bella|last3=Gowdy|first3=John|last4=Nunes|first4=Paulo A.

People were more likely to say they would avoid the beach before an outbreak, yet during outbreaks respondents were about twice as likely to say they would enter the water regardless.<ref name=\":25\" /> This suggests that jellyfish blooms are in some cases more of an inconvenience to recreation than a significant hindrance. Still, models predict that persistent annual jellyfish blooms could contribute to 1.8\u20136.2 million \u20ac tourism losses annually.<ref name=\":25\" />\n\nScientific articles that support abnormal jellyfish blooms are more attractive to mainstream media, causing a dramatization of jellyfish bloom events in the public eye. This disproportionate coverage of bloom events changes public perception about the presence of jellyfish, which could lead to the impacts on tourism.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Historical records ==\n\n=== Paleontological ===\n[[File:Anomalocaris canadensis mouthpiece, Burgess Shale.jpg|thumb|A fossilized jellyfish from the Middle-Cambrian Period Burgess shale from southwestern Canada.|alt=|242x242px]]Various types of jellyfish population booms have been recorded in fossil evidence as early as 540 million years ago during the Early [[Cambrian|Cambrian Period]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Other evidence was found dating back to the Middle to Late Cambrian Period (520\u2013540 mya) and the [[Neogene|Neogene Period]] (20\u201330 mya). The soft-bodied anatomy of jellyfish makes fossilization rare, which provides challenges to recreate the historical abundances of blooms. Most preserved jellyfish bloom fossils are from the Cambrian period likely due to the abundance of marine life and lack of terrestrial scavengers during this time.\n\n=== Modern ===\nGlobal data on jellyfish populations span between 1940 and 2011 and indicate that global jellyfish populations oscillate, reaching periodic maximums every 20 years.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, there appears to be a small linear increase in jellyfish abundances beginning in the 1970s.<ref name=\":8\" />\u00a0Jellyfish blooms have increased notably in Japan, the North Atlantic Shelf, Denmark, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Barents Sea.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> However, there are also several examples where jellyfish populations are decreasing in areas that are heavily impacted by humans.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIt is difficult to discern how jellyfish blooms will be affected by changing environmental conditions. Some studies indicate that changes in climate alter the [[phenology]] of jellyfish, causing temporal shifts in bloom events.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Condon|first=Robert H.|last2=Steinberg|first2=Deborah K.|date=2008-10-13|title=Development, biological regulation, and fate of ctenophore blooms in the York River estuary, Chesapeake Bay|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=369|pages=153\u2013168|doi=10.3354/meps07595|issn=0171-8630|bibcode=2008MEPS..369..153C|doi-access=free}}</ref> Much research in the future will also investigate the impacts of short and long term environmental and climatic pressures on jellyfish abundances.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Data collection challenges ===\nChallenges in discerning jellyfish bloom trends partially arise from the lack of long-term data sets. This lack of data also inhibits researchers' abilities to distinguish between jellyfish bloom oscillations caused by natural versus anthropogenic impacts. One review demonstrated that there were increasing trends of jellyfish abundances in 28 out of the 45 [[Large marine ecosystem|Large Marine Ecosystems]] globally.<ref name=\":20\" /> However, the review notes the limitations of their analyses, given substantial time series data is unavailable.<ref name=\":1\" /> Other studies refute the idea that global jellyfish populations are increasing at all; they state that these variations are simply part of the larger-scale climatic and ecosystem processes. The lack of data has been interpreted as a lack of blooms.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAn additional difficulty with studying jellyfish bloom dynamics is understanding how populations change in both the [[Polyp (zoology)|polyp]] and [[Jellyfish|medusae]] life stages of a jellyfish. Medusae are much easier for researchers to track and observe due to their size and presence in the water. However, the ecology of the polyp life stage is not well understood in most jellyfish species. Many polyps are difficult to sample due to their fragility.<ref name=\":1\" /> There have been calls for future research to focus on the ecology of both the medusae and the polyp life stages to better understand bloom dynamics throughout the organisms' entire lifespans.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Jelly-falls|Jelly falls]]\n*[[Fishing down the food web]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cnidarians]]\n[[Category:Ctenophores]]\n", "name_user": "ATaysikuu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTourism - correcting typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_bloom"}
