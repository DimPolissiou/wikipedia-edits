Twice in the late 1980s they came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in [[1992\u201393 in English football|1993]] they narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Football Conference]]. Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the [[English football league system]] for the only time in their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]].\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n:{{details|History of Gillingham F.C.}}\n:{{for|a statistical breakdown by season|List of Gillingham F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Gills1913.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The official announcement of the club's change of name in 1913|alt=A document announcing that New Brompton Football Club has changed its name to Gillingham Football Club, dated 1913]]\nThe local success of a junior football side, '''Chatham Excelsior F.C.''', encouraged a group of businessmen to meet with a view to creating a football club which could compete in larger competitions.

The team competes in [[Football League One|League One]], the third tier of the [[English football league system]].\n\nThe club was founded in 1893 and joined the Football League in 1920. They were voted out of the league in favour of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at the end of the [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] season, but returned to it 12 years later after it was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s they came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in [[1992\u201393 in English football|1993]] they narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Football Conference]]. Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the [[English football league system]] for the only time in their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]].\n\n==History==\n:{{details|History of Gillingham F.C.}}\n:{{for|a statistical breakdown by season|List of Gillingham F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Gills1913.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The official announcement of the club's change of name in 1913|alt=A document announcing that New Brompton Football Club has changed its name to Gillingham Football Club, dated 1913]]\nThe local success of a junior football side, '''Chatham Excelsior F.C.''', encouraged a group of businessmen to meet with a view to creating a football club which could compete in larger competitions.

The [[dam]] is situated 110&nbsp;km from [[Dushanbe]]. It is one of the planned [[hydroelectric]] power plants of Vakhsh Cascade.\n\nConstruction of the dam began in the Soviet era, in 1976, but was abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Over three decades only preliminary construction has been carried out on the dam. Due to its controversial state, construction was suspended in August 2012 pending [[World Bank]] reports. The project was restarted by the Tajik government with [[Belt and Road Initiative|Chinese help]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ariana-co.com/en/news/36|title=Beginning Rogun Powerhouse intake & outlet tower operation|last=Ariana|website=www.ariana-co.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> The power plant's first unit was commissioned in November 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.salini-impregilo.com/en/press/news-events/tajikistan-president-starts-first-turbine-of-rogun-hydroelectric-dam-being-developed-by-salini-impregilo.html|title=Tajikistan President starts first turbine of Rogun hydroelectric dam being developed by Salini Impregilo - Salini Impregilo|website=www.salini-impregilo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\nThe dam has drawn complaints from neighboring [[Uzbekistan]], which fears it will negatively impact its lucrative [[cotton]] [[crop]]s.

The [[dam]] is situated 110&nbsp;km from [[Dushanbe]]. It is one of the planned [[hydroelectric]] power plants of Vakhsh Cascade.\n\nConstruction of the dam began in the Soviet era, in 1976, but was abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Over three decades only preliminary construction has been carried out on the dam. Due to its controversial state, construction was suspended in August 2012 pending [[World Bank]] reports. The project was restarted by the Tajik government with [[Belt and Road Initiative|Chinese help]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ariana-co.com/en/news/36|title=Beginning Rogun Powerhouse intake & outlet tower operation|last=Ariana|website=www.ariana-co.com|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> The power plant's first unit was commissioned in November 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.salini-impregilo.com/en/press/news-events/tajikistan-president-starts-first-turbine-of-rogun-hydroelectric-dam-being-developed-by-salini-impregilo.html|title=Tajikistan President starts first turbine of Rogun hydroelectric dam being developed by Salini Impregilo - Salini Impregilo|website=www.salini-impregilo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\nThe dam has drawn complaints from neighboring [[Uzbekistan]], which fears it will negatively impact its lucrative [[cotton]] [[crop]]s.

Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], from 5 to 21 August 2016. \"Chinese Taipei\" is the designated name used by [[Taiwan]] to participate in some international [[organizations]] and almost all sporting events, including the [[Olympic Games]]. Neither the common name \"Taiwan\" nor the official name \"Republic of China\" would be used due primarily to opposition from the [[People's Republic of China]]. This was also the nation's ninth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe [[Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee]] sent a team of 57 athletes, 26 men and 31 women, to compete in 18 sports at the Games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/sports/olympics/2016/08/15/475505/In-review.htm|title=In review: ROC's long tradition in the Olympics|work=[[China Post]]|date=15 August 2016|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> For only the third time in Olympic history, Chinese Taipei roster featured more female athletes than males. Among the sporting events represented by the nation's athletes, Chinese Taipei made its Olympic debut in equestrian jumping and golf (new to the 2016 Games), as well as its return to gymnastics, boxing, and wrestling after more than fifteen years.\n\nWorld-ranked tennis star [[Lu Yen-hsun]], table tennis players [[Huang I-hua]] and [[London 2012]] fourth-place finalist [[Chuang Chih-yuan]], and trap shooter [[Lin Yi-chun]] highlighted the list of athletes to make the Chinese Taipei roster for their fourth Olympics. Apart from the veterans, twelve Taiwanese athletes previously competed in London, with weightlifter [[Hsu Shu-ching]] leading them as the only medalist to return for her second appearance in Rio de Janeiro. Other notable athletes from Chinese Taipei also featured world's top 30 golfers [[Candie Kung]] and [[Teresa Lu]], and lone show jumper [[Isheau Wong]], who eventually served as the nation's second female flag bearer in the opening ceremony (the first having done so in 2008).<ref name=\"flag-bearer\"/>\n\nChinese Taipei left Rio de Janeiro with only three medals (one gold and two bronze), a slight improvement on the team's performance at the previous Games. Among the medalists were the women's archery team (led by [[Tan Ya-ting]], who eventually finished among the top eight in the individual recurve), and weightlifters [[Kuo Hsing-chun]] (women's 58&nbsp;kg) and Hsu, who upgraded her silver from London to a golden finish in the women's 53&nbsp;kg category.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3728371/Taiwans-Hsu-wins-womens-53kg-weightlifting-gold.html|title=Taiwanese lifter Hsu demands London gold after Rio win|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=7 August 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2016/08/08/474786/Taiwan-wins.htm|title=Taiwan wins first medals in Rio|work=[[China Post]]|date=8 August 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref> For the first time in history, Chinese Taipei did not obtain any medals in taekwondo, since the sport was officially added to the Olympic program in [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Joseph|last=Yeh|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/sports/olympics/2016/08/22/476197/Taiwan-leaves.htm|title=Taiwan leaves Rio with one gold, two bronzes and a few controversies|work=[[China Post]]|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Medalists==\n{{further|2016 Summer Olympics medal table|List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|-\n!
