This vibrant period of India\u2019s history that saw a great upheaval also saw intense drama unfold in the lives of the royalty of the [[princely states]]. Behind empty walls of grandeur and fake displays of splendor was hidden the truth of erosion of wealth, insecurities, succumbing to [[British Raj|British dominion]], depression and bankruptcy. Ek Tha Raja Ek Thi Rani is a story of love set against this most interesting canvas. It aims to give viewers an up close and personal view of the lifestyles and some of the most closely guarded secrets of the rich and royal of the 1940s. It is a work of fiction that draws inspiration from the lives of the royalty of that period.\"<ref>http://businessofcinema.com/tele/zee-tvs-ek-tha-raja-ek-thi-rani-is-all-set-to-take-viewers-to-the-1940s/219039</ref>\n\nProducers ''Sunjoy'' and ''Comall Wadhwa'' of [[Sphere Origins]] further add, \u201cThe idea has been to look back at a glorious period of history for inspiration and churn out a timeless masterpiece that will entertain and enthrall TV audiences. The most daunting task at hand has been the re-creation of the pre-Independence era and the majestic lifestyles of the kings and queens of the princely states. Enormous research has gone to ensure authentic representation of the era and to create magic on screen. We have on board an ensemble of extremely impressive actors who beautifully fit the parts they are playing. The show will definitely turn out to be a clutter-breaker and hopefully, the biggest fiction show of the year.\u201d\n\n===Casting===\nPopular TV Actress, [[Drashti Dhami]] was roped in the play the lead as Gayatri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/drashti-dhami-return-sphere-origins-show-zee-tv-anita-raj-roped-150124|title=Drashti Dhami to return with Sphere Origin's show on Zee TV; Anita Raj roped in|date=24 January 2015 |url-status=live |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> Speaking about her comeback to television post her last show ''[[Madhubala \u2013 Ek Ishq Ek Junoon]]'', she said \u201cI do feel a little under pressure since \u2018Madhubala\u2019 was such a success. But I am also looking forward to seeing my fans\u2019 reaction to my new show.

This vibrant period of India\u2019s history that saw a great upheaval also saw intense drama unfold in the lives of the royalty of the [[princely states]]. Behind empty walls of grandeur and fake displays of splendor was hidden the truth of erosion of wealth, insecurities, succumbing to [[British Raj|British dominion]], depression and bankruptcy. Ek Tha Raja Ek Thi Rani is a story of love set against this most interesting canvas. It aims to give viewers an up close and personal view of the lifestyles and some of the most closely guarded secrets of the rich and royal of the 1940s. It is a work of fiction that draws inspiration from the lives of the royalty of that period.\"<ref>http://businessofcinema.com/tele/zee-tvs-ek-tha-raja-ek-thi-rani-is-all-set-to-take-viewers-to-the-1940s/219039</ref>\n\nProducers ''Sunjoy'' and ''Comall Wadhwa'' of [[Sphere Origins]] further add, \u201cThe idea has been to look back at a glorious period of history for inspiration and churn out a timeless masterpiece that will entertain and enthrall TV audiences. The most daunting task at hand has been the re-creation of the pre-Independence era and the majestic lifestyles of the kings and queens of the princely states. Enormous research has gone to ensure authentic representation of the era and to create magic on screen. We have on board an ensemble of extremely impressive actors who beautifully fit the parts they are playing. The show will definitely turn out to be a clutter-breaker and hopefully, the biggest fiction show of the year.\u201d\n\n===Casting===\nPopular TV Actress, [[Drashti Dhami]] was roped in the play the lead as Gayatri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/drashti-dhami-return-sphere-origins-show-zee-tv-anita-raj-roped-150124|title=Drashti Dhami to return with Sphere Origin's show on Zee TV; Anita Raj roped in|date=24 January 2015 |url-status=live |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> Speaking about her comeback to television post her last show ''[[Madhubala \u2013 Ek Ishq Ek Junoon]]'', she said \u201cI do feel a little under pressure since \u2018Madhubala\u2019 was such a success.

Archaeological evidence of these First people includes a number of occurrences of [[rock carving]]s, especially in southern Sonoma County; these carvings often take the form of [[pecked curvilinear nucleated]] design. [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], [[Russians]], and other [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] claimed and settled in the county from the late 16th to mid-19th century, seeking timber, fur, and farmland.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe Russians were the first newcomers to establish a permanent foothold in Sonoma County, with the [[Russian-American Company]] establishing [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the Sonoma Coast in 1812. This settlement and its outlying Russian settlements came to include a population of several hundred Russian and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] settlers and a stockaded fort with artillery. However, the Russians abandoned it in 1841 and sold the fort to [[John Sutter]], settler and Mexican [[land grant]]ee of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n[[File:FortRoss-chapel-reconstructed.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] was established by the Russians in 1812.]]\n\nThe [[Mission San Francisco Solano]], founded in 1823 as the last and northernmost of 21 [[Spanish Missions of California|California missions]], is in the present [[Sonoma, California|City of Sonoma]], at the northern end of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. [[Presidio of Sonoma|El Presidio de Sonoma]], or Sonoma Barracks (part of Spain's ''[[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|Fourth Military District]]''), was established in 1836 by Comandante General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]. His duties included keeping an eye on the Russian traders at Fort Ross, secularizing the Mission, maintaining cooperation with the Native Americans of the entire region, and doling out the lands for large estates and ranches. The City of Sonoma was the site of the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] in 1846.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSonoma was one of the original counties formed when California became a state in 1850,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.counties.org/county-history |title=California County History |work=CSAC.org |publisher=California State Association of Counties |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-09-22 }}</ref> with its [[county seat]] originally the town of Sonoma. However, by the early 1850s, Sonoma had declined in importance in both commerce and population, its county buildings were crumbling, and it was relatively remote. As a result, elements in the newer, rapidly growing towns of [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]], Santa Rosa, and [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]] began vying to move the county seat to their towns. The dispute ultimately was between the bigger, richer commercial town of Petaluma and the more centrally located, growing agricultural center of Santa Rosa. The fate was decided following an election for the state legislature in which James Bennett of Santa Rosa defeated [[Joseph Hooker]] of Sonoma and introduced a bill that resulted in Santa Rosa being confirmed as county seat in 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/sonoma/1880-382.htm |title=Sonoma County History |website=Calarchives4u.com |accessdate=July 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319220837/http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/sonoma/1880-382.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2014 }}</ref> Allegedly, several Santa Rosans, not caring to wait, decided to take action and, one night, rode down the Sonoma Valley to Sonoma, took the county seals and records, and brought them to Santa Rosa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.ap.net/~chenae/socohist.html |publisher=AccessPort |website=ap.net |title=History of Sonoma County |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107010823/http://users.ap.net/~chenae/socohist.html |archivedate=January 7, 2012 }}</ref> Some of the county's land{{which|date=January 2020}} was annexed from [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino County]] between 1850 and 1860.\n\nEarly post-1847 settlement and development focused primarily on the city of Sonoma, then the region's sole town and a common transit and resting point in overland travel between the region and Sacramento and the gold fields to the east. However, after 1850, a settlement that soon became the city of Petaluma began to grow naturally near the farthest navigable point inland up the [[Petaluma River]]. Originally a hunting camp used to obtain game to sell in other markets, by 1854 Petaluma had grown into a bustling center of trade, taking advantage of its position in the river near a region of highly productive agricultural land that was being settled. Soon, other inland towns, notably Santa Rosa and Healdsburg began to develop similarly due to their locations along riparian areas in prime agricultural flatland. However, their development initially lagged behind Petaluma which, until the arrival of railroads in the 1860s, remained the primary commercial, transit, and break-of-bulk point for people and goods in the region. After the arrival of the [[San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad]] in 1870, Santa Rosa began to boom, soon equalling and then surpassing Petaluma as the region's population and commercial center. The railroad bypassed Petaluma for southern connections to [[ferries of San Francisco Bay]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSix nations have claimed Sonoma County from 1542 to the present:{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:Flag of New Spain.svg|border|40px]]\n|[[Spanish Empire]], 1542, by sea, voyage of [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] as far as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].

Its ranges include the [[Mayacamas Mountains|Mayacamas]] and the [[Sonoma Mountains]], the southern peak of the latter being the prominent landform [[Sears Point]]. The highest peak in the Mayacamas within the county is [[Mt. Saint Helena]]. It has uncommon occurrences of [[pygmy forest]], dominated by [[Cupressus pigmaea|Mendocino cypress]]. The highest peak of the Sonoma Mountains is [[Sonoma Mountain]] itself, which boasts two significant public access properties: [[Jack London State Historic Park]] and [[Fairfield Osborn Preserve]].\n\nThe county includes the City of Sonoma and the [[Sonoma Valley]], in which the City of Sonoma is located. However, these are not synonymous. The City of Sonoma is merely one of several incorporated cities in the county. The Sonoma Valley itself makes up only the southeastern portion of the county, which includes many other valleys and geographic zones. Moreover, the Sonoma Valley itself includes not only the City of Sonoma, but a portion of the City of Santa Rosa and the unincorporated communities of Kenwood, Agua Caliente, Boyes Hot Springs, and Fetters Hot Springs. Other regions of the county beyond the Sonoma Valley include, among others, the Petaluma Valley, the [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa Plains]], the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], the [[Alexander Valley AVA|Alexander Valley]], and the [[Dry Creek Valley AVA|Dry Creek Valley]].\n\nDistinct habitat areas within the county include oak [[woodland]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] [[Northern California coastal forests (WWF ecoregion)|forest]], [[northern coastal scrub]], [[grassland]], [[marsh]]land, oak [[savanna]] and [[riparian zone|riparian woodland]]. The [[California oak woodland]] in the upper [[Yulupa Creek]] and [[Spring Creek (Sonoma County, California)|Spring Creek]] watersheds in [[Annadel State Park]] is a relatively undisturbed ecosystem with considerable [[biodiversity]].

This is in large part due to the fact that, as throughout California, the prevailing weather systems and wind come normally from the Pacific Ocean, blowing in from the west and southwest so that places closer to the ocean and on the windward side of higher elevations tend to receive more rain from autumn through spring and more summer wind and fog. This itself is partly a result of the presence of high and low pressures in inland California, with persistent high summer temperatures in the Central Valley, in particular, leading to low pressures, drawing in moist air from the Pacific, cooling into damp cool breezes and fog over the cold coastal water. Those places further inland and particularly in the lee of significant elevations tend to receive less rain and less, in some cases no, fog in the summer.\n\nThe coast itself is typically cool and moist throughout summer, often foggy, with fog generally blowing in during the late afternoon and evening until it clears in the later morning to be sunny, before repeating. Coastal summer highs are typically in the mid to high 60s, warming to the low 70s further from the ocean.\n\nCertain inland areas, including the Petaluma area and the Santa Rosa Plain, are also prone to this normal fog pattern in general.<ref name=\"ucDavisClimate\" /> However, they tend to receive the fog later in the evening, the fog tends to be more short-lived, and mid-day temperatures are significantly higher than they are on the coast, typically in the low 80s F. This is particularly true for Petaluma, [[Cotati, California|Cotati]] and [[Rohnert Park, California|Rohnert Park]], and, only slightly less so, Santa Rosa, [[Windsor, California|Windsor]], and [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]]. In large part this results from lower elevations and the prominent [[Petaluma Gap]] in the hills between the ocean to the west and the Petaluma Valley and Santa Rosa Plain to the east.\n\nAreas north of Santa Rosa and Windsor, with larger elevations to the west and further from the fog path, tend to receive less fog and less summer marine influence. Healdsburg to the north of Windsor is less foggy and much warmer, with summer highs typically in the higher 80s to about {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Sonoma and the Sonoma Valley, east of Petaluma, are similar, with highs typically in the very high 70s F to {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. This is in part due to the presence of the Sonoma Mountains between Petaluma and Sonoma. [[Cloverdale, California|Cloverdale]] far to the north out of the Santa Rosa Plain, is significantly hotter than any other city in the county, with rare evening-morning fog and highs often in the 90s, reaching {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} much more frequently than the other cities. Notably, however, the temperature differences among the different areas of the county are greatest for the highs during mid-day, with the diurnal lows much more even throughout the entire county. The lows are closely tied to the evening-morning cooling marine influence, in addition to elevation, bringing similarly cool temperatures to much of region.\n\nThese weather patterns contribute to high diurnal temperature fluctuations in much of the county. In summer, daily lows and highs are typically 30\u201340&nbsp;\u00b0F apart in land, with highs for Petaluma, Cotati, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Windsor, and Sebastopol typically being in the very low 80s F and lows at or near {{convert|50|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Healdsburg and Sonoma, with similar lows, have even greater diurnal fluctuations due to their significantly warmer highs. On the other hand, the coast, with strong marine influence, tends to have low diurnal temperature fluctuation, with summer highs much cooler than the inland towns, typically 65\u201375&nbsp;\u00b0F, yet lows in the high 40s to low 50s F, fairly comparable to most inland towns.\n\nThese microclimates are evident during the rainy seasons as well, with great variation in the amount of rainfall throughout the county. Generally, all of Sonoma County receives a fair amount of rain, with much of the county receiving between about {{convert|25|in|mm|abbr=on}}, comparable to areas such as Sonoma and Petaluma, and roughly {{convert|30|in|mm|abbr=on}} normal for Santa Rosa. However, certain areas, particularly in the north-west portion of the county around the Russian River, receive significantly more rainfall. The [[Guerneville, California|Guerneville]] area, for example, typically receives about {{convert|50|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year, with annual rain occasionally going as high as {{convert|70|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Nearby Cazadero typically receives about {{convert|72|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year, many times has reached over {{convert|100|in|mm|abbr=on}} a year, and sometimes over {{convert|120|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year.

Running north/south through the states of California, [[Oregon]], and Washington, it generally parallels the coastline from the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexico\u2013US border]] to the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]]. Highway 101 links seven of the county's nine incorporated cities: Cloverdale, Healdsburg, Windsor, Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, Cotati, and Petaluma. It is a freeway for its entire length within the county.\n\nThe four-lane sections of the highway have been heavily congested during peak commute hours for many years and work is being done to widen part of the highway to six lanes.The segment from north of Petaluma (at Old Redwood Highway/Petaluma Boulevard North exit) to Windsor has been fully widened. The two new inner lanes are designated for [[High-occupancy vehicle|vehicles with two or more occupants]] during commute hours. Work is being done near the Sonoma/Marin county line which will also involve upgrading this segment of the highway to [[Interstate Highway standards|full freeway standards]].\n\n[[File:California 1.svg|20px|link= |alt=]] [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]]\n\nWithin Sonoma County, Highway 1 follows the coastline from the Mendocino County border, at the mouth of the Gualala River, to the Marin County border, at the Estero Americano ([[Americano Creek]]), east of Bodega Bay.\n\n[[File:California 12.svg|20px|link= |alt=]] [[California State Route 12|State Route 12]]\n[[File:CA SR-12 Sonoma.jpg|thumb|right|[[California State Route 12|State Route 12]] in Sonoma (Broadway)]]\n\nHighway 12 runs eastward from its intersection with Highway 116 in Sebastopol to Santa Rosa. There it turns south through the Valley of the Moon to Sonoma, then east into Napa County. The four-lane freeway section within Santa Rosa, between Fulton Road and Farmers Lane, is called the Luther Burbank Memorial Highway. That section, especially where it crosses Highway 101, is severely congested during peak commute hours.\n\nThe two-lane Bodega Highway runs west from the intersection of Highways 12 and 116 in Sebastopol, through the coastal hills to its intersection with Highway 1, east of Bodega Bay. East of Santa Rosa, Highway 12 is also called Sonoma Highway; and east of Sonoma, Carneros Highway.\n\n[[File:California 37.svg|20px|link= |alt=]] [[California State Route 37|State Route 37]]\n\nHighway 37 connects Highway 101 at Novato, in Marin County, with Interstate 80 in Vallejo, in Solano County, at the top of San Pablo Bay. Within Sonoma County, it is also called Sears Point Road.\n\n[[File:California 116.svg|25px|link= |alt=]] [[California State Route 116|State Route 116]]\n\nHighway 116 is a winding, two-lane rural route that runs from Jenner, at the mouth of the Russian River on the coast, southeast to Arnold Drive near Sonoma. It is also called Guerneville Highway, between Guerneville and Forestville; Gravenstein Highway North, between Forestville and Sebastopol; and Gravenstein Highway South, between Sebastopol and Stony Point Road, west of Rohnert Park. East of Petaluma it is Lakeville Highway, then Stage Gulch Road.\n\n[[File:California 121.svg|25px|link= |alt=]] [[California State Route 121|State Route 121]]\n\nHighway 121 is a two-lane rural route running from Highway 37 near Sears Point Raceway to Highway 128 in Lake Berryessa.\n\n[[File:California 128.svg|25px|link= |alt=]] [[California State Route 128|State Route 128]]\n\nThe northernmost section of Highway 128 is a two-lane, rural route running southeast from Highway 101 at Geyserville, north of Healdsburg, through the Alexander Valley and into Napa County.\n\n===Public transportation===\n*[[Sonoma County Transit]] is the countywide transit operator, providing service to all cities in Sonoma County.\n*CityBus operates within the city limits of Santa Rosa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ci.santa-rosa.ca.us/departments/transit/citybus/pages/default.aspx|title=CityBus|publisher=City of Santa Rosa|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref>\n*The cities of Cloverdale and Petaluma also provide their own local bus service.\n*[[Golden Gate Transit]] connects Santa Rosa and points south with Marin County and San Francisco.\n*[[Mendocino Transit Authority]] runs north from Santa Rosa to Ukiah (via US 101) and to the coast (via California Routes 12 and 1).\n*[[Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit]] (SMART) is a [[commuter rail]] line eventually planned to go between [[Larkspur, California|Larkspur]] in Marin County and Cloverdale in Sonoma County. {{as of|December 2019}} the line operates a far north as Sonoma County Airport.\n\n===Airports===\n*The [[Charles M.

Some of the earliest U.S. filmmaking occurred in Sonoma County such as ''Salomy Jane'' (1914) and one of [[Broncho Billy Anderson]]'s 1915 Westerns. Many of these films are classics in American [[cinematography]] such as the 1947 film ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'' (starring [[Joseph Cotten]] and [[Loretta Young]]) and two [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films, ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' of 1943, filmed and set in Santa Rosa and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' of 1963, filmed largely in Bodega Bay and Bodega. Many other modern classics have used Sonoma County as a filming venue, including ''[[American Graffiti]]'', filmed largely in Petaluma.\n\nA few other representative films produced partially in Sonoma County are:\n{{Clear}}\n{|\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n'''Sonoma County'''\n* 1965 ''[[The Third Day]]''\n* 1986 ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' \u2013 Petaluma, including a 1950s makeover of Washington St., the diner \"Millie's Chili Bar\" (rechristened as \"The Donut Hole\"), and exterior and interior shots of [[Santa Rosa High School (Santa Rosa, California)|Santa Rosa High School]].\n* 1993 ''Nowhere to Run'' \u2013 Coleman Valley Road, Occidental, for farmhouse and pond scenes.\n* 2001 ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]''\n* 2001 ''[[Bandits (2001 film)|Bandits]]'' \u2013 Flamingo Hotel, Clover milk truck featuring local icon \"Clo the cow\" and rural county roads.\n\n'''Cloverdale'''\n* 1955 ''[[Many Rivers to Cross]]'' \u2013 Big Sulphur Creek\n* 1993 ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' \u2013 Cloverdale Airport\n\n'''Glen Ellen'''\n* 1982 ''[[Shoot the Moon]]'' \u2013 Glen Ellen and Jack London's [[Wolf House]].\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Petaluma'''\n* 1972 ''[[American Graffiti]]''\n* 1977 ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' \u2013 Bus stop at corner of Kentucky and C streets.

Archaeological evidence of these First people includes a number of occurrences of [[rock carving]]s, especially in southern Sonoma County; these carvings often take the form of [[pecked curvilinear nucleated]] design. [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], [[Russians]], and other [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] claimed and settled in the county from the late 16th to mid-19th century, seeking timber, fur, and farmland.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe Russians were the first newcomers to establish a permanent foothold in Sonoma County, with the [[Russian-American Company]] establishing [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the Sonoma Coast in 1812. This settlement and its outlying Russian settlements came to include a population of several hundred Russian and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] settlers and a stockaded fort with artillery. However, the Russians abandoned it in 1841 and sold the fort to [[John Sutter]], settler and Mexican [[land grant]]ee of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n[[File:FortRoss-chapel-reconstructed.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] was established by the Russians in 1812.]]\n\nThe [[Mission San Francisco Solano]], founded in 1823 as the last and northernmost of 21 [[Spanish Missions of California|California missions]], is in the present [[Sonoma, California|City of Sonoma]], at the northern end of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. [[Presidio of Sonoma|El Presidio de Sonoma]], or Sonoma Barracks (part of Spain's ''[[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|Fourth Military District]]''), was established in 1836 by Comandante General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]. His duties included keeping an eye on the Russian traders at Fort Ross, secularizing the Mission, maintaining cooperation with the Native Americans of the entire region, and doling out the lands for large estates and ranches. The City of Sonoma was the site of the [[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]] in 1846.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSonoma was one of the original counties formed when California became a state in 1850,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.counties.org/county-history |title=California County History |work=CSAC.org |publisher=California State Association of Counties |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-09-22 }}</ref> with its [[county seat]] originally the town of Sonoma. However, by the early 1850s, Sonoma had declined in importance in both commerce and population, its county buildings were crumbling, and it was relatively remote. As a result, elements in the newer, rapidly growing towns of [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]], Santa Rosa, and [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]] began vying to move the county seat to their towns. The dispute ultimately was between the bigger, richer commercial town of Petaluma and the more centrally located, growing agricultural center of Santa Rosa. The fate was decided following an election for the state legislature in which James Bennett of Santa Rosa defeated [[Joseph Hooker]] of Sonoma and introduced a bill that resulted in Santa Rosa being confirmed as county seat in 1854.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/sonoma/1880-382.htm |title=Sonoma County History |website=Calarchives4u.com |accessdate=July 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319220837/http://www.calarchives4u.com/history/sonoma/1880-382.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2014 }}</ref> Allegedly, several Santa Rosans, not caring to wait, decided to take action and, one night, rode down the Sonoma Valley to Sonoma, took the county seals and records, and brought them to Santa Rosa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.ap.net/~chenae/socohist.html |publisher=AccessPort |website=ap.net |title=History of Sonoma County |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107010823/http://users.ap.net/~chenae/socohist.html |archivedate=January 7, 2012 }}</ref> Some of the county's land{{which|date=January 2020}} was annexed from [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino County]] between 1850 and 1860.\n\nEarly post-1847 settlement and development focused primarily on the city of Sonoma, then the region's sole town and a common transit and resting point in overland travel between the region and Sacramento and the gold fields to the east. However, after 1850, a settlement that soon became the city of Petaluma began to grow naturally near the farthest navigable point inland up the [[Petaluma River]]. Originally a hunting camp used to obtain game to sell in other markets, by 1854 Petaluma had grown into a bustling center of trade, taking advantage of its position in the river near a region of highly productive agricultural land that was being settled. Soon, other inland towns, notably Santa Rosa and Healdsburg began to develop similarly due to their locations along riparian areas in prime agricultural flatland. However, their development initially lagged behind Petaluma which, until the arrival of railroads in the 1860s, remained the primary commercial, transit, and break-of-bulk point for people and goods in the region. After the arrival of the [[San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad]] in 1870, Santa Rosa began to boom, soon equalling and then surpassing Petaluma as the region's population and commercial center. The railroad bypassed Petaluma for southern connections to [[ferries of San Francisco Bay]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSix nations have claimed Sonoma County from 1542 to the present:{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:Flag of New Spain.svg|border|40px]]\n|[[Spanish Empire]], 1542, by sea, voyage of [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] as far as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].

Its ranges include the [[Mayacamas Mountains|Mayacamas]] and the [[Sonoma Mountains]], the southern peak of the latter being the prominent landform [[Sears Point]]. The highest peak in the Mayacamas within the county is [[Mt. Saint Helena]]. It has uncommon occurrences of [[pygmy forest]], dominated by [[Cupressus pigmaea|Mendocino cypress]]. The highest peak of the Sonoma Mountains is [[Sonoma Mountain]] itself, which boasts two significant public access properties: [[Jack London State Historic Park]] and [[Fairfield Osborn Preserve]].\n\nThe county includes the City of Sonoma and the [[Sonoma Valley]], in which the City of Sonoma is located. However, these are not synonymous. The City of Sonoma is merely one of several incorporated cities in the county. The Sonoma Valley itself makes up only the southeastern portion of the county, which includes many other valleys and geographic zones. Moreover, the Sonoma Valley itself includes not only the City of Sonoma, but a portion of the City of Santa Rosa and the unincorporated communities of Kenwood, Agua Caliente, Boyes Hot Springs, and Fetters Hot Springs. Other regions of the county beyond the Sonoma Valley include, among others, the Petaluma Valley, the [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa Plains]], the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], the [[Alexander Valley AVA|Alexander Valley]], and the [[Dry Creek Valley AVA|Dry Creek Valley]].\n\nDistinct habitat areas within the county include oak [[woodland]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] [[Northern California coastal forests (WWF ecoregion)|forest]], [[northern coastal scrub]], [[grassland]], [[marsh]]land, oak [[savanna]] and [[riparian zone|riparian woodland]]. The [[California oak woodland]] in the upper [[Yulupa Creek]] and [[Spring Creek (Sonoma County, California)|Spring Creek]] watersheds in [[Annadel State Park]] is a relatively undisturbed ecosystem with considerable [[biodiversity]].

This is in large part due to the fact that, as throughout California, the prevailing weather systems and wind come normally from the Pacific Ocean, blowing in from the west and southwest so that places closer to the ocean and on the windward side of higher elevations tend to receive more rain from autumn through spring and more summer wind and fog. This itself is partly a result of the presence of high and low pressures in inland California, with persistent high summer temperatures in the Central Valley, in particular, leading to low pressures, drawing in moist air from the Pacific, cooling into damp cool breezes and fog over the cold coastal water. Those places further inland and particularly in the lee of significant elevations tend to receive less rain and less, in some cases no, fog in the summer.\n\nThe coast itself is typically cool and moist throughout summer, often foggy, with fog generally blowing in during the late afternoon and evening until it clears in the later morning to be sunny, before repeating. Coastal summer highs are typically in the mid to high 60s, warming to the low 70s further from the ocean.\n\nCertain inland areas, including the Petaluma area and the Santa Rosa Plain, are also prone to this normal fog pattern in general.<ref name=\"ucDavisClimate\" /> However, they tend to receive the fog later in the evening, the fog tends to be more short-lived, and mid-day temperatures are significantly higher than they are on the coast, typically in the low 80s F. This is particularly true for Petaluma, [[Cotati, California|Cotati]] and [[Rohnert Park, California|Rohnert Park]], and, only slightly less so, Santa Rosa, [[Windsor, California|Windsor]], and [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]]. In large part this results from lower elevations and the prominent [[Petaluma Gap]] in the hills between the ocean to the west and the Petaluma Valley and Santa Rosa Plain to the east.\n\nAreas north of Santa Rosa and Windsor, with larger elevations to the west and further from the fog path, tend to receive less fog and less summer marine influence. Healdsburg to the north of Windsor is less foggy and much warmer, with summer highs typically in the higher 80s to about {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Sonoma and the Sonoma Valley, east of Petaluma, are similar, with highs typically in the very high 70s F to {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. This is in part due to the presence of the Sonoma Mountains between Petaluma and Sonoma. [[Cloverdale, California|Cloverdale]] far to the north out of the Santa Rosa Plain, is significantly hotter than any other city in the county, with rare evening-morning fog and highs often in the 90s, reaching {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} much more frequently than the other cities. Notably, however, the temperature differences among the different areas of the county are greatest for the highs during mid-day, with the diurnal lows much more even throughout the entire county. The lows are closely tied to the evening-morning cooling marine influence, in addition to elevation, bringing similarly cool temperatures to much of region.\n\nThese weather patterns contribute to high diurnal temperature fluctuations in much of the county. In summer, daily lows and highs are typically 30\u201340&nbsp;\u00b0F apart in land, with highs for Petaluma, Cotati, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Windsor, and Sebastopol typically being in the very low 80s F and lows at or near {{convert|50|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Healdsburg and Sonoma, with similar lows, have even greater diurnal fluctuations due to their significantly warmer highs. On the other hand, the coast, with strong marine influence, tends to have low diurnal temperature fluctuation, with summer highs much cooler than the inland towns, typically 65\u201375&nbsp;\u00b0F, yet lows in the high 40s to low 50s F, fairly comparable to most inland towns.\n\nThese microclimates are evident during the rainy seasons as well, with great variation in the amount of rainfall throughout the county. Generally, all of Sonoma County receives a fair amount of rain, with much of the county receiving between about {{convert|25|in|mm|abbr=on}}, comparable to areas such as Sonoma and Petaluma, and roughly {{convert|30|in|mm|abbr=on}} normal for Santa Rosa. However, certain areas, particularly in the north-west portion of the county around the Russian River, receive significantly more rainfall. The [[Guerneville, California|Guerneville]] area, for example, typically receives about {{convert|50|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year, with annual rain occasionally going as high as {{convert|70|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Nearby Cazadero typically receives about {{convert|72|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year, many times has reached over {{convert|100|in|mm|abbr=on}} a year, and sometimes over {{convert|120|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain a year.

Many of these films are classics in American [[cinematography]] such as the 1947 film ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'' (starring [[Joseph Cotten]] and [[Loretta Young]]) and two [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films, ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' of 1943, filmed and set in Santa Rosa and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' of 1963, filmed largely in Bodega Bay and Bodega.

The project floundered in [[development hell]] for many years; [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]], [[Todd Alcott]], and [[Joss Whedon]], among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for ''Wonder Woman'' was drawn from Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]'s 1940s stories and [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as [[the New 52]] incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\n''Wonder Woman'' had its world premiere in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].

A plot summary for a film article should be 400\u2013700 words, and should not go below or exceed the required limit. -->\nIn present-day [[Paris]], [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana is raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] women warriors created by [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains the Amazonian history to Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the \"Godkiller\", to prepare them for Ares's return.\n\nAlthough she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let General [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], Hippolyta's sister and Diana's aunt, train her, only more rigorously than any other warrior.\n\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by [[Imperial German Navy|German]] soldiers that had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]] and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist [[Doctor Poison|Dr. Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]] under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]] from a weapon facility in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"Godkiller\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.\n\nIn London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the [[Supreme War Council]], where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the nearby village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love.\n\nThe team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, and Diana hoping to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\n\nMorgan appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"Godkiller\" sword, he destroys it, then reveals to Diana that she herself is the \"Godkiller\", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]]. \n\nIn the present day, Diana sends an email to [[Bruce Wayne]] thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight and give on the world's behalf, understanding that only love can truly save the world.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--STOP! The characters are listed as they are in the film's credits.

The project floundered in [[development hell]] for many years; [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]], [[Todd Alcott]], and [[Joss Whedon]], among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for ''Wonder Woman'' was drawn from Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]'s 1940s stories and [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as [[the New 52]] incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\n''Wonder Woman'' had its world premiere in Shanghai on May 15, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 2, 2017, in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received largely positive <!--DO ''not'' PUT ACCLAIM --> reviews, with praise for its direction, acting, visuals, action sequences, and musical score. <ref name=\"reviews\" /> However, it also received criticism for the main villain and the climax.

A plot summary for a film article should be 400\u2013700 words, and should not go below or exceed the required limit. -->\nIn present-day [[Paris]], [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana is raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] women warriors created by [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains the Amazonian history to Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the \"Godkiller\", to prepare them for Ares's return.\n\nAlthough she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let General [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], Hippolyta's sister and Diana's aunt, train her, only more rigorously than any other warrior.\n\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by [[Imperial German Navy|German]] soldiers that had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]] and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist [[Doctor Poison|Dr. Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]] under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]] from a weapon facility in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"Godkiller\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.\n\nIn London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the [[Supreme War Council]], where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the nearby village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love.\n\nThe team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, and Diana hoping to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\n\nMorgan appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"Godkiller\" sword, he destroys it, then reveals to Diana that she herself is the \"Godkiller\", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]]. \n\nIn the present day, Diana sends an email to [[Bruce Wayne]] thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight and give on the world's behalf, understanding that only love can truly save the world.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--STOP! The characters are listed as they are in the film's credits.
