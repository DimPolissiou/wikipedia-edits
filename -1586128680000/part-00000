Kaufman]], with additional text by [[Morrie Ryskind]].\n\n==Background==\n''The Cocoanuts'' was written for the [[Marx Brothers]] after the success of their hit Broadway revue ''[[I'll Say She Is]]'' (1924). ''The Cocoanuts'' is set against the backdrop of the 1920s [[Florida Land Boom]], which was followed by the inevitable bust. Groucho is a hotel proprietor, land impresario, and [[confidence trick|con man]], assisted and hampered by two inept [[Confidence trick|grifters]], Chico and Harpo, and the ultra-rational hotel assistant, Zeppo. Groucho pursues a wealthy dowager ripe for a swindle, played by the dignified [[Margaret Dumont]].\n\nProduced by [[Sam H. Harris]], the musical was given a tryout in [[Boston]] on October 26, 1925, then [[Philadelphia]]. The Broadway run opened at the [[Lyric Theatre (1903 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]] on December 8, 1925 and closed on August 7, 1926 after 276 performances. The production was directed by Oscar Eagle, with musical staging by Sammy Lee.\n\nAfter the Broadway closing, the brothers took the show on tour.  On June 10, 1926, four new songs and other changes were introduced in the show. The new version, referred to as the \"1926 Summer Edition\", featured the [[Brox Sisters]], who sang the songs originally assigned to the character of Penelope.<ref>Songs from both versions were published.

''Catalog of the American musical: musicals of Irving Berlin, George & Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart'' (Washington, D.C.: National Institute for Opera and Musical Theater, 1988)</ref>\n\nA brief Broadway revival played at the [[Century Theatre (New York City)|Century Theatre]] from May 16, 1927 to May 28, 1927 with the same creative team. The more famous [[The Cocoanuts|film adaptation]] was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1929, soon after the addition of synchronized sound permitted [[talkie|talking movies]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Act 1===\n;Scene 1 \u2013 Lobby of The Cocoanuts, a hotel in Cocoanut Beach, Florida.\n\nThe hotel guests love Florida, but not the hotel.  Eddie, a bellhop, asks Jamison, a hotel desk clerk, when the staff will get paid.  Jamison gives an evasive response and suggests that he ask Mr. Schlemmer, the hotel owner.  Harvey Yates enters, followed shortly by Mrs. Potter.  Mrs. Potter wants her daughter, Polly, to marry Harvey, since she has known his family for a long time.  She exits as Penelope Martin enters.  Penelope and Harvey know each other from their backgrounds in thievery.  Penelope suggests to Harvey that he can strike it rich by marrying Polly, since Mrs. Potter has millions of dollars.  Polly soon enters and makes it clear that she is romantically interested in Bob Adams, an architecture student who is currently the chief clerk of the hotel.  But Mrs. Potter won't allow Polly to be seen with Bob.  She comments, \"One who clerks, Polly, is a clerk.  And that settles it.\"  After Mrs. Potter exits, Polly laments the restrictions placed on her (\"Family Reputation\").\n\nThe owner of the hotel, Henry W. Schlemmer, enters, and the bellboys go after him asking for their wages.  Through fast double-talk he is able to distract them and send them on their way.  He has his eyes on Mrs. Potter, trying unsuccessfully to convince her to buy the hotel.  Meanwhile, Bob and Polly discuss their predicament.  He has a plan to build housing on a particular lot in Cocoanut Manor.  The bellhops try to convince Bob that he's fortunate (\"Lucky Boy\").  Schlemmer and Jamison are at the desk discussing business when Willie the Wop and Silent Sam enter and start to wreak havoc.  After they leave, Harvey and Penelope discuss how she will steal Mrs. Potter's valuable necklace later that evening.  Schlemmer explains to the girls why he is a \"Hit With The Ladies\".  Detective Hennessy enters along with Willie and Sam and explains that he's looking for two wanted men whose descriptions they fit.  Although he won't do anything yet, he warns them.  After they leave, Bob asks Polly whether she could live on that lot in Cocoanut Manor (\"A Little Bungalow\").\n\n;Scene 2 \u2013 Before the Palms.\n\nSchlemmer tries to make amorous advances toward Mrs. Potter.  \"I don't think you'd love me if I were poor\" she says, to which Schlemmer responds \"I might, but I'd keep my mouth shut.\"  To prove his interest, he tells her about \"A Little Bungalow\" (reprise).\n\n;Scene 3 \u2013 Two adjacent rooms in the hotel.\n\nPenelope is getting ready to steal Mrs. Potter's necklace and waits for Harvey.  Meanwhile, Sam sneaks in and hides under Penelope's bed.  Harvey discusses with Penelope where they will put the necklace.  He suggests a hollow tree stump on Cocoanut Manor and draws a map.  After he leaves, Penelope studies the map and throws in the garbage, but Sam immediately retrieves it, unseen.\n\nAs Penelope tries to enter Mrs. Potter's room, she and Mrs. Potter have to contend with a series of encounters with Schlemmer, Willie and Hennessey.  Penelope finally succeeds in stealing the necklace and re-enters her own room, proclaiming \"Alone at last,\" not realizing that Sam is still under the bed.\n\n;Scene 4 \u2013 Before the Palms.\n\nThe guests extol \"Florida By The Sea\".  Meanwhile, Schlemmer explains to Willie how to bid in the upcoming property auction.  After much misunderstanding, Willie agrees.\n\n;Scene 5 \u2013 Cocoanut Manor.\n\nFrances Williams and the guest await the auction (\"Monkey Doodle-Doo\").  Schlemmer begins the auction.  He starts the bidding, but Willie bids against himself.  Lot after lot is \"sold\" to Willie, who seems to keep bidding higher and higher against his own bids.  Finally Schlemmer reaches Lot 26, which is both the lot where Bob wants to build his house and the lot containing the hollow tree stump where Penelope and Harvey are hiding Mrs. Potter's stolen necklace.  Bidding between Bob and Harvey becomes fierce.  Willie knocks out Harvey, and Bob wins the auction for Lot 26.  Just then, Mrs. Potter proclaims that her necklace has been stolen.  Hennessey steps forward and tries to investigate.  Sam produces the necklace from the hollow tree stump.  Harvey suggests that Bob must know something about the necklace, since he won the lot in an auction.  Penelope steps forward and fabricates a story in which she teases Bob for stealing the necklace.  That's enough for Hennessey, who arrests Bob and takes him away.  Mrs. Potter then announces the engagement of Harvey to Polly, to be celebrated with a dinner at the hotel that night.  All exit except Polly who is left crying.  Sam consoles Polly but winks at the audience.\n\n===Act 2===\n;Scene 1 \u2013 The Lounge of the hotel.\n\nPenelope and the guests have \"Five O'Clock Tea\".  Polly asks Schlemmer for 2,000 dollars to get Bob out of jail.  Schlemmer humorously discusses this with Willie and Sam, and eventually Mrs. Potter, without telling her what the money is for.  Everyone dances (\"They're Blaming the Charleston\").  Harvey and Penelope worry about the map he drew, which would implicate them in the robbery.  Willie enters, and they realize he has the map.  They leave, and Schlemmer enters with Bob, whom he got out of jail for nineteen hundred dollars \u2013 \"They had a sale,\" he explains.  Willie shows Bob the map, and Bob realizes that the map is evidence.  That makes him feel better, and together with Polly, they comment, \"We Should Care\".\n\nMrs. Potter enters with Schlemmer to discuss the engagement dinner.  Hennessey is conducting an investigation, hampered by Willie, Sam and Schlemmer.  He asks to hear from Penelope (\"Minstrel Days\").  Hennessey continues the investigation, but Willie and Sam take his shirt.  Hennessey wonders what happened to his shirt.\n\n;Scene 2 \u2013 Before the Palms.\n\nSchlemmer introduces a musical specialty number played by the De Marcos, who he describes as not being Spaniards, but Span-Yids (i.e. Jewish musicians).\n\n;Scene 3 \u2013 The Patio of the hotel.\n\nPenelope dances a tango (\"Spain\").  After agreement with Bob, Polly suggests to Harvey that they elope at midnight at Cocoanut Manor, and Harvey agrees.  But since Polly doesn't know where it is, she gets Harvey to draw a map of how to get there.  She thanks him, takes the map, and leaves.  As more guests enter for dinner, Hennessey laments his lost shirt (\"The Tale of a Shirt\"; the melody combines the Habanera and Toreador song from ''[[Carmen]]'').  As master of ceremonies, Schlemmer makes a speech concerning the engagement of Harvey to Polly.  He then introduces Mrs. Potter, who makes a few short remarks interrupted by constant interjections by Schlemmer, Willie and Sam.  Harvey makes a short speech.  Then Willie plays a piano number, followed by Sam playing the harp.\n\nPolly dashes in and proclaims that she has new evidence, showing the map that Harvey drew for her alongside the one he drew for Penelope.  Hennessey sees for himself that the handwriting is identical.  Bob enters and says that a millionaire from Miami wants to buy Cocoanut Manor, which will enable him to realize his architectural dreams.  Polly shows the maps to her mother, who announces a \"slight change\" \u2013 that Polly will be engaged to Bob Adams.  Everyone rejoices (\"A Little Bungalow\" reprise).\n\n''Note: In the original script, Schlemmer, Willie, and Sam are identified as Julius, Chico and Harpo.''\n\n== Songs ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* Opening:  ''The Guests'' - Jamison, Cocoanut Grove Girls, Boys\n* Opening:  ''The Bellhops'' - Eddie, 16 Stepping Bellhops\n* ''Family Reputation'' - Polly, Cocoanut Grove Beauties\n* ''Lucky Boy'' - Bob, Boys\n* ''Why Am I a Hit With The Ladies?'' -  Schlemmer, Girls\n* ''A Little Bungalow'' - Bob, Polly, Cocoanut Grove Boys and Girls\n* ''A Little Bungalow'' (reprise) - Schlemmer\n* ''Florida By The Sea'' - Jamison, Cocoanut Grove Boys and Girls\n* ''Monkey Doodle-Do'' - Frances Williams, Ensemble\n* Finale:\n** ''Lucky Boy'' (reprise)\n** ''A Little Bungalow'' (reprise) - The Entire Company\n{{col-break}}\n;Act 2\n* Opening: Tea Dance - The Eight Teat Girls\n* ''Five O'Clock Tea'' - Cocoanut Grove Ensemble; specialty dance by Antonio and Nina de Marco\n* ''They're Blaming The Charleston'' - Frances Williams, Antonio and Nina de Marco, and Charleston Girls\n* ''We Should Care'' - Bob, Polly, Eddie, Speer, Ensemble\n* ''Minstrel Days'' - Penelope, Company\n* Specialty - De Marco Orchestra\n* ''Spain'' (Tango Melody) - Penelope; specialty dance by Antonio and Nina de Marco\n* ''The Tale of a Shirt'' - Hennessy, Company\n* piano specialty - Willie (Chico)\n* harp specialty - Silent Sam (Harpo)\n* Finale: ''A Little Bungalow'' (reprise) - Entire Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Characters and original cast ==\n*'''Jamison''', the desk clerk of The Cocoanuts, a hotel in [[Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida]] \u2013 [[Zeppo Marx]]\n*'''Eddie''', a bellhop \u2013 Georgie Hale\n*'''Mrs. Potter''', mother of Polly, a guest at the hotel \u2013 [[Margaret Dumont]]\n*'''Penelope Martin''', a confidence woman, accomplice of Harvey \u2013 Janet Velie\n*'''Harvey Yates''', a swindler, friend to Penelope - Henry Wittmore\n*'''Polly Potter''', daughter of Mrs. Potter, in love with Bob \u2013 [[Mabel Withee]]\n*'''Robert Adams''', a young architect, in love with Polly \u2013 Jack Barker\n*'''Henry W.

Chico is referred to as \"Signor Pastrami\" by both Groucho and Margaret Dumont in the film. \"[[Wop]]\" is an Italian ethnic slur, dropped for the film, although Chico retains his fake Italian accent as he would throughout his career.\n(Note: Several times during the film, Groucho begins to call Chico \"Ravelli\", but stops himself; the Marxes were performing ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'' on Broadway at the same time they were filming ''The Cocoanuts''; Chico's character was \"Ravelli\" in that show)\n*The role of Penelope is more sharply characterized as a villain in the film; in the musical, she sings two songs which would detract somewhat from her role as a [[con woman]].\n*''Florida By The Sea'' was made the opening musical number in the film.\n*After musical numbers, the play opens with a sequence of dialogues between Eddie, Jamison, Mrs. Potter, Harvey, and Polly to establish their characters.  These were all eliminated for the film  where the plot begins with the entrance of Mr. Hammer (Schlemmer).\n*The larger role of Eddie, the bellhop from the show is reduced to just a few lines at the beginning of the film.\n*The famous \"Why a Duck\" routine was not in the original play; it was written for the film.\nHarpo's harp specialty number was removed from the final scene of the film. Instead he plays a clarinet reprise of ''When My Dreams Comes True'' heard earlier in the film.\n*The frequently-reprised song ''A Little Bungalow'' was dropped from the film and was replaced by ''When My Dreams Come True''.  The melody of verse of the latter song is derived from another song, ''We Should Care'' (which was also eliminated for the film).\n\n== Off-Broadway revival and regional performances ==\n''The Cocoanuts'' opened in June 1996 at the American Jewish Theatre in New York City, with [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]], Peter Slutsker and Robert Sapoff as Groucho, Chico and Harpo Marx respectively.<ref name=play1>Viagas, Robert.

Eddie, a bellhop, asks Jamison, a hotel desk clerk, when the staff will get paid.  Jamison gives an evasive response and suggests that he ask Mr. Schlemmer, the hotel owner.  Harvey Yates enters, followed shortly by Mrs. Potter.  Mrs. Potter wants her daughter, Polly, to marry Harvey, since she has known his family for a long time.  She exits as Penelope Martin enters.  Penelope and Harvey know each other from their backgrounds in thievery.  Penelope suggests to Harvey that he can strike it rich by marrying Polly, since Mrs. Potter has millions of dollars.  Polly soon enters and makes it clear that she is romantically interested in Bob Adams, an architecture student who is currently the chief clerk of the hotel.  But Mrs. Potter won't allow Polly to be seen with Bob.  She comments, \"One who clerks, Polly, is a clerk.  And that settles it.\"  After Mrs. Potter exits, Polly laments the restrictions placed on her (\"Family Reputation\").\n\nThe owner of the hotel, Henry W. Schlemmer, enters, and the bellboys go after him asking for their wages.  Through fast double-talk he is able to distract them and send them on their way.  He has his eyes on Mrs. Potter, trying unsuccessfully to convince her to buy the hotel.  Meanwhile Bob and Polly discuss their predicament.  He has a plan to build housing on a particular lot in Cocoanut Manor.  The bellhops try to convince Bob that he's fortunate (\"Lucky Boy\").  Schlemmer and Jamison are at the desk discussing business when Willie the Wop and Silent Sam enter and start to wreak havoc.  After they leave, Harvey and Penelope discuss how she will steal Mrs. Potter's valuable necklace later that evening.  Schlemmer explains to the girls why he is a \"Hit With The Ladies\".  Detective Hennessy enters along with Willie and Sam and explains that he's looking for two wanted men whose descriptions they fit.  Although he won't do anything yet, he warns them.  After they leave, Bob asks Polly whether she could live on that lot in Cocoanut Manor (\"A Little Bungalow\").\n\n;Scene 2 \u2013 Before the Palms.\n\nSchlemmer tries to make amorous advances toward Mrs. Potter.  \"I don't think you'd love me if I were poor\" she says, to which Schlemmer responds \"I might, but I'd keep my mouth shut.\"  To prove his interest, he tells her about \"A Little Bungalow\" (reprise).\n\n;Scene 3 \u2013 Two adjacent rooms in the hotel.\n\nPenelope is getting ready to steal Mrs. Potter's necklace and waits for Harvey.  Meanwhile, Sam sneaks in and hides under Penelope's bed.  Harvey discusses with Penelope where they will put the necklace.  He suggests a hollow tree stump on Cocoanut Manor and draws a map.  After he leaves, Penelope studies the map and throws in the garbage, but Sam immediately retrieves it, unseen.\n\nAs Penelope tries to enter Mrs. Potter's room, she and Mrs. Potter have to contend with a series of encounters with Schlemmer, Willie and Hennessey.  Penelope finally succeeds in stealing the necklace and re-enters her own room, proclaiming \"Alone at last,\" not realizing that Sam is still under the bed.\n\n;Scene 4 \u2013 Before the Palms.\n\nThe guests extol \"Florida By The Sea\".  Meanwhile, Schlemmer explains to Willie how to bid in the upcoming property auction.  After much misunderstanding, Willie agrees.\n\n;Scene 5 \u2013 Cocoanut Manor.\n\nFrances Williams and the guest await the auction (\"Monkey Doodle-Doo\").  Schlemmer begins the auction.  He starts the bidding, but Willie bids against himself.  Lot after lot is \"sold\" to Willie, who seems to keep bidding higher and higher against his own bids.  Finally Schlemmer reaches Lot 26, which is both the lot where Bob wants to build his house and the lot containing the hollow tree stump where Penelope and Harvey are hiding Mrs. Potter's stolen necklace.  Bidding between Bob and Harvey becomes fierce.  Willie knocks out Harvey, and Bob wins the auction for Lot 26.  Just then, Mrs. Potter proclaims that her necklace has been stolen.  Hennessey steps forward and tries to investigate.  Sam produces the necklace from the hollow tree stump.  Harvey suggests that Bob must know something about the necklace, since he won the lot in an auction.  Penelope steps forward and fabricates a story in which she teases Bob for stealing the necklace.  That's enough for Hennessey, who arrests Bob and takes him away.  Mrs. Potter then announces the engagement of Harvey to Polly, to be celebrated with a dinner at the hotel that night.

Everyone dances (\"They're Blaming the Charleston\").  Harvey and Penelope worry about the map he drew, which would implicate them in the robbery.  Willie enters, and they realize he has the map.  They leave, and Schlemmer enters with Bob, whom he got out of jail for nineteen hundred dollars \u2013 \"They had a sale,\" he explains.  Willie shows Bob the map, and Bob realizes that the map is evidence.  That makes him feel better, and together with Polly, they comment, \"We Should Care\". \n\nMrs. Potter enters with Schlemmer to discuss the engagement dinner.  Hennessey is conducting an investigation, hampered by Willie, Sam and Schlemmer.  He asks to hear from Penelope (\"Minstrel Days\").  Hennessey continues the investigation, but Willie and Sam take his shirt.  Hennessey wonders what happened to his shirt.\n\n;Scene 2 \u2013 Before the Palms.\n\nSchlemmer introduces a musical specialty number played by the De Marcos, who he describes as not being Spaniards, but Span-Yids (i.e. Jewish musicians).\n\n;Scene 3 \u2013 The Patio of the hotel.\n\nPenelope dances a tango (\"Spain\").  After agreement with Bob, Polly suggests to Harvey that they elope at midnight at Cocoanut Manor, and Harvey agrees.  But since Polly doesn't know where it is, she gets Harvey to draw a map of how to get there.  She thanks him, takes the map, and leaves.

Chico is referred to as \"Signor Pastrami\" by both Groucho and Margaret Dumont in the film. \"[[Wop]]\" is an Italian ethnic slur, dropped for the film, although Chico retains his fake Italian accent as he would throughout his career.\n(Note: Several times during the film, Groucho begins to call Chico \"Ravelli\", but stops himself; the Marxes were performing ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'' on Broadway at the same time they were filming ''The Cocoanuts''; Chico's character was \"Ravelli\" in that show)\n*The role of Penelope is more sharply characterized as a villain in the film; in the musical, she sings two songs which would detract somewhat from her role as a [[con woman]].\n*''Florida By The Sea'' was made the opening musical number in the film.\n*After musical numbers, the play opens with a sequence of dialogues between Eddie, Jamison, Mrs. Potter, Harvey, and Polly to establish their characters.  These were all eliminated for the film  where the plot begins with the entrance of Mr. Hammer (Schlemmer).\n*The larger role of Eddie, the bellhop from the show is reduced to just a few lines at the beginning of the film.\n*The famous \"Why a Duck\" routine was not in the original play; it was written for the film.\nHarpo's harp specialty number was removed from the final scene of the film. Instead he plays a clarinet reprise of ''When My Dreams Comes True'' heard earlier in the film.\n*The frequently-reprised song ''A Little Bungalow'' was dropped from the film and was replaced by ''When My Dreams Come True''.  The melody of verse of the latter song is derived from another song, ''We Should Care'' (which was also eliminated for the film).\n\n== Off-Broadway revival and regional performances ==\n{{unref|section|date=May 2019}}\n''The Cocoanuts'' opened in June 1996 at the American Jewish Theatre in New York City, with [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]], Peter Slutsker and Robert Sapoff as Groucho, Chico and Harpo Marx respectively.<ref name=play1>Viagas, Robert.

In Norwood Labour Party Knight met [[Ken Livingstone]], later Leader of the [[Greater London Council]] and [[Mayor of London]], and the two formed an alliance to influence the selection of candidates in Norwood for the council elections in 1974. After that, they jostled for the leadership of the left within the Labour Group on Lambeth Borough Council but Livingstone's later move to Camden in North London left the way open for Knight to become the leading left-winger within the Labour Group and Leader of the Council.\n\nWhen the Conservative Government took powers through the [[Rates Act 1984]] to limit the budgets of local councils, several left-wing Labour councils organised a [[rate-capping rebellion|rebellion]] in which they refused to set a budget. All the councils eventually backed down except [[Liverpool City Council]] and Lambeth. The district auditor found that the council had lost interest on tax payments as a result, which was held to be due to the \"wilful misconduct\" of Knight and 31 other councillors. Each was required to repay the amount of lost interest in a surcharge and banned from holding office for five years. The Labour Party's leader, [[Neil Kinnock]], blamed local leaders like Ted Knight and [[Linda Bellos]] from Lambeth, for bringing the [[Labour Party UK|Labour Party]] into disrepute.\n\nPrior to the 1987 general election, Knight was a potential candidate for [[Coventry North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry North East]]: a runner-up at the [[Constituency Labour Party]] selection meeting, he lost out to [[John Hughes (Coventry North East MP)|John Hughes]].\n\n==After Lambeth==\nKnight took a break from politics after being expelled from office as a result of the [[Rate-capping rebellion]].

Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up his win in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961.

As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility.

Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground.

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and the horse is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, Northern Dancer led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; FLAMINGO CHOICE 7\u2010LENGTH VICTOR; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race\u2014Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101-103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby; HARTACK TO RIDE BIG STAKES VICTOR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108-109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds.

Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2-1 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2-1 and Quadrangle at 13-2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor.

Nine others also became stakes winners, an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127-129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second-crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130-134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978.

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a [[stallion|sire]] of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer then became the first Canadian-bred to ever win the [[Kentucky Derby]], following up with a win in the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of [[Windfields Farm]]. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> Northern Dancer's paternal grandsire was the Italian-bred horse [[Nearco]], two-time [[leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=\"Nearco\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Nearco (horse)|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/nearco-ity.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961.

As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> \n\nHe next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and the horse is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, Northern Dancer led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''Daily Racing Form'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road.

Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; FLAMINGO CHOICE 7\u2010LENGTH VICTOR; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race\u2014Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101-103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby; HARTACK TO RIDE BIG STAKES VICTOR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland]] on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack; VICTOR GAINS LEAD AT STRETCH TURN |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12.

Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105-107</ref>\n\nOn the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108-109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds.

Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina.

Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2-1 and Quadrangle at 13-2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you?

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became stakes winners, an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127-129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''[[The Blood-Horse]]''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second-crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130-134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984.
