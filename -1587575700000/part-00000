It is based on the book of the same name by [[Lois Lowry]]. \n\nThe film stars the voices of [[Will Forte]], [[Martin Short]], [[Alessia Cara]], [[Jane Krakowski]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] and [[Terry Crews]]. The film was released on April 22, 2020 and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Willoughbys were once considered a proud family. However, the current generation of the family is very dysfunctional as the parents are too busy being sexually involved with each other to take care of their four kids; the eldest sibling Tim, who lives in a coal bin and tries to keep his siblings out of trouble, middle child Jane, a singing enthusiast who is constantly silenced by her parents, and the youngest twin boys who are both named Barnaby, both of whom are very smart and inventive but are labelled as 'creepy'. Their misfortunes are told from the perspective of a stray blue tabby cat who talks to the audience. \n\nSoon, the siblings find a baby inside a box that was thrown outside of their gate that they name Ruth. When the parents force their kids out of the house after discovering Ruth, they leave her on the doorstep of a candy factory and the factory director, Commander Melanoff, takes Ruth in. Wanting a better life, Jane tells her siblings they should send their parents on a 'vacation' by fabricating a brochure about travelling (when she hope for the parents to eventually die of some natural cause), though Tim has his reservations yet still goes along with it. The parents take the bait and proceed to leave the kids to their own devices. After a few days of celebrating their freedom, they are suddenly visited by a nanny the next day due to the parents having hired her to supervise the kids (albeit she came at a cheap price). At first, the kids try to get rid of her as well, but she soon warms up to them, except for Tim.\n\nAfter Tim misbehaves, the nanny tries to put him in time out, but soon learns of what happened to Ruth. She goes to Melanoff's factory to confront him and retrieve Ruth, and after chasing Ruth through some conveyer belts, the kids, Melanoff, and the nanny all get to know each other well. Meanwhile, the parents manage to survive the disasters (though their guides are not so fortunate) and when they get short on cash, they use the internet to sell their house in order to continue their vacation and inform the nanny to get rid of their kids. Tim learns of this and, believing the nanny is just as bad as their parents, calls Orphan Services to report her and he and his siblings get rid of all the potential buyers that soon line up to buy the house. They nearly fail to scare off a joyous family, but the nanny scares them off and finally convinces Tim that she means well. However, Orphan Services arrive at the house and try to take the kids. The head of the services recognizes the nanny, who she calls Linda, and reveals that she is an orphan herself who never found a family who wanted her.\n\nWhen it's revealed that Tim called them, Linda leaves in tears and Jane angrily denounces Tim as they are taken away and separated to individual homes, the Barnabys are taken in by a family with electronics, Jane's adopted by hippies, and Tim keeps running away from his foster homes and soon ends up at the Orphan Services center in a prison cell and the Willoughby mansion is destroyed. The cat stops a bus that Linda is on and has carried Tim's signature pith helmet to convince her to reunite them. She does so, with Tim apologizing to Jane and while on the run, Tim suggests that they get their parents back in order for Orphan Services to leave them alone, despite how much their kids hate them. Reluctantly agreeing to this, the kids' get help from Melanoff to construct a giant candy-fuelled dirigible to get to Switzerland, where their parents are and planning to climb a giant dangerous mountain. \n\nThe kids take the dirigible without Linda and when they arrive at Switzerland, they find a trail of their Mom's yarn and soon discover their parents are about to freeze to death near the mountain's top. After saving them, the kids confess that they sent them away and Tim gives a passionate speech about how, despite how selfish the parents are, they are still family. Just as the parents look like they'll change for the better, they shove their kids out of the way and take the dirigible, but their lack of driving expertise cause them to crash the dirigible in the mountain's top and flies out of control over the horizon, most likely killing them. Just as the kids soon resign themselves to being frozen, Ruth, Linda, and Melanoff save them and the kids tell them what happened to their parents. Linda and Melanoff decide to adopt the kids and they all move to the candy factory as a loving family.\n\nBefore the credits, it's shown that Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby have survived the dirigible crash and are, as always, enjoying each other's company while floating on the debris, but their luck finally ends when they are soon devoured by a shark.\n\nAfter the credits, it shows the cat licking and when he notices the audience, he tries to defend himself.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Will Forte]] as Tim Willoughby, the rational eldest child of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Mr. Willoughby, the neglectful Willoughby patriarch.\n* [[Alessia Cara]] as Jane Willoughby, the fun-loving middle-child of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Mrs. Willoughby, the neglectful Willoughby matriarch.\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as The Cat, a talking blue tabby cat and the narrator of this film.\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Nanny, an eccentric babysitter who must look after the kids.\n* [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] as the Barnabys, the creepy twin boys and youngest children of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Commander Melanoff, the joyous owner of a candy factory.\n\n== Production ==\nIn November 2015, [[Bron Studios]] acquired the animated film rights to the [[Lois Lowry]]'s book ''The Willoughbys'', and hired Kris Pearn to adapt into a screenplay with Adam Wood to direct the film, with Aaron L.

At the age of 29, he was the youngest executive officer in the university\u2019s history. In 1982, he joined The Burks Group, a commercial [[real estate]] company.

During his term education funding increased by approximately 30 percent and a $350 million [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issue for [[higher education]] brought construction and renovation to every state college campus.\n\nWalters planned on making the Blue Room, a large ceremonial hall in the [[Oklahoma State Capitol|State Capitol]], into his office.<ref>[http://newsok.com/walters-plans-to-convert-blue-room-into-his-office/article/2343734 Walters plans to convert Blue Room into his office], Newsok.com, January 10, 1991 (accessed April 6, 2013)</ref>\n\nWhile in office he was accused of election violations in that he conspired to hide $18,000 dollars in campaign donations by attributing them to someone else. At the end of procedures, Governor Walters asked prosecutors what they wanted to end the rather lengthy process. An agreement was reached that the governor would plead guilty to a misdemeanor offense and pay a fine, in return for which his record would be expunged in twelve months. Though Walters claimed his innocence of the charges, he said it was in the best interest of the state and his family to accept the plea agreement.

He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter.<ref>McLanathan 1986, p. 150.</ref> His family recovered from their financial troubles 10 years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved.<ref>Wolpaw, Jim. ''Gilbert Stuart: A Portrait from Life (9-Minute Trailer)''.

[[John Adams]] said:\n\n{{quote|Speaking generally, no penance is like having one's picture done. You must sit in a constrained and unnatural position, which is a trial to the temper.

His approach is suggested by the advice which he gave to his pupil [[Matthew Harris Jouett]]: \"Never be sparing of colour, load your pictures, but keep your colours as separate as you can.

He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts him to bed after offering him chamomile tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and [[self-publishing|privately printed]] by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by [[Frederick Warne & Co]]. in [[1902 in literature|1902]]. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages,<ref name=\"MackeyP33\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=33}}</ref> and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] in history.<ref>Worker's Press</ref>\n\nSince its release the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game.\nPeter Rabbit is a favorite for children of all ages the tales of which there are many are often read to children as 'bedtime stories' They however can be enjoyed by all ages through the hit movie that was released a few years ago.\n\n\n\n\ni have a question Peter rabbit goes into mr mc Gregory garden and eats his vegetables is it fair for him to eat his vegstables should mr mc Gregor be able keep animals from eating his vegstables in his garden.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story focuses on a family of anthropomorphic rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit warns her four rabbit children, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and [[Peter Rabbit|Peter]] not to enter the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, she tells them, put their father in a pie after he entered. Her triplets (Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail) obediently refrain from entering the garden, but Peter enters the garden to snack on some [[vegetables]]. Peter ends up eating more than what is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's [[scarecrow]]. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, after she tells him that his jacket and shoes are the second jacket and pair of shoes that he has lost in a fortnight. His mother also takes note that he was not feeling too well, and deduces that he had definitely been to Mr McGregor's garden. To cure his stomachache, Mrs. Rabbit gives him [[chamomile tea]] which is revealed to be one teaspoon and gives a dose of it to Peter. Peter's sisters, meanwhile, receive a scrumptuous dinner of milk, bread and blackberries.\n\n==Composition==\nThe story was inspired by a pet rabbit Potter had as a child, which she named Peter Piper.<ref name=\"MackeyP35\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=35}}</ref> Through the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of her former [[governess]], Annie Moore. In 1900, Moore, realizing the commercial potential of Potter's stories, suggested they be made into books. Potter embraced the suggestion, and, borrowing her complete correspondence (which had been carefully preserved by the Moore children), selected a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel that featured a tale about a rabbit named Peter. Potter biographer [[Linda Lear]] explains: \"The original letter was too short to make a proper book so [Potter] added some text and made new black-and-white illustrations...and made it more suspenseful. These changes slowed the narrative down, added intrigue, and gave a greater sense of the passage of time. Then she copied it out into a stiff-covered exercise book, and painted a coloured frontispiece showing Mrs Rabbit dosing Peter with camomile tea\".<ref name=\"LearP142\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=142}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Private publication===\n[[File:1901 First Edition of Peter Rabbit.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1901 privately published edition]]\nAs Lear explains, Potter titled ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden'' and sent it to publishers, but \"her manuscript was returned&nbsp;... including Frederick Warne & Co.&nbsp;... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork. Some publishers wanted a shorter book, others a longer one. But most wanted coloured illustrations which by 1900 were both popular and affordable\".<ref name=\"LearP143\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=143}}</ref> The several rejections were frustrating to Potter, who knew exactly how her book should look (she had adopted the format and style of [[Helen Bannerman]]'s ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'') \"and how much it should cost\".<ref name=\"LearP1143-144\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=143\u2013144}}</ref> She decided to publish the book herself, and on 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' were \"ready for distribution to family and friends\".<ref name=\"LearP145\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=145}}</ref>\n\n===First commercial edition===\nIn 1901, as Lear explains, a Potter family friend and sometime poet, [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], set Potter's tale into \"rather dreadful didactic verse and submitted it, along with Potter's illustrations and half her revised manuscript, to Frederick Warne & Co.,\" who had been among the original rejecters.<ref name=\"LearP145-146\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=145\u2013146}}</ref> Warne editors declined Rawnsley's version \"but asked to see the complete Potter manuscript\" \u2013 their interest stimulated by the opportunity ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' offered the publisher to compete with the success of Helen Bannerman's wildly popular ''Little Black Sambo'' and other small-format children's books then on the market. When Warne inquired about the lack of colour illustrations in the book, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green were not good subjects for colouration. Warne declined the book but left open the possibility of future publication.<ref name=\"LearP146\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=146}}</ref>\n\nWarne wanted colour illustrations throughout the \"bunny book\" (as the firm referred to the tale) and suggested cutting the illustrations \"from forty-two to thirty-two ... and marked which ones might best be eliminated\".<ref name=\"LearP146\" /> Potter initially resisted the idea of colour illustrations, but then realized her stubborn stance was a mistake. She sent Warne \"several colour illustrations, along with a copy of her privately printed edition\" which Warne then handed to their eminent children's book illustrator [[L. Leslie Brooke]] for his professional opinion. Brooke was impressed with Potter's work. Fortuitously, his recommendation coincided with a sudden surge in the small picture-book market.<ref name=\"LearP147\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=147}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Potter continued to distribute her privately printed edition to family and friends, with the celebrated creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], acquiring a copy for his children. When the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out, another 200 were prepared.<ref name=\"LearP150\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=150}}</ref> She noted in an inscription in one copy that her beloved pet rabbit Peter had died.<ref name=\"LearP149\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=149}}</ref>\n\nPotter arrived at an agreement with Warne for an initial commercial publication of 5,000 copies.<ref name=\"LearP148\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=148}}</ref> Negotiations dragged on into the following year, but a contract was finally signed in June 1902.<ref name=\"LearP149\" /> Potter was closely involved in the publication of the commercial edition \u2013 redrawing where necessary, making minor adjustments to the prose and correcting punctuation. The blocks for the illustrations and text were sent to [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] [[Edmund Evans]] for [[Wood engraving|engraving]], and she made adjustments to the [[Galley proof|proofs]] when she received them. Lear writes that \"Even before the publication of the tale in early October 1902, the first 8,000 copies were sold out. By the year's end there were 28,000 copies of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in print. By the middle of 1903 there was a fifth edition sporting coloured endpapers ... a sixth printing was produced within the month\"; and a year after the first commercial publication there were 56,470 copies in print.<ref name=\"LearP152\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=152}}</ref>\n\n===American copyright===\nWarne's New York office \"failed to register the [[copyright]] for ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in the United States\"{{citequote}}, and [[License|unlicensed]] copies of the book \"(from which Potter would receive no [[royalties]]) began to appear in the spring of 1903. There was nothing anyone could do to stop them\".{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\nThe enormous financial loss \"... [to Potter] only became evident over time\"{{citequote}}.  The necessity of protecting her intellectual property hit home after the successful 1903 publication of ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' when her father returned from [[Burlington Arcade]] in [[Mayfair]] at Christmas 1903 with a toy squirrel labelled \"Nutkin\".<ref name=\"LearP164\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=164}}</ref><!--this part really doesn't have to do with the American copyright-->\n\n==Merchandising==\n[[File:PeterRabbit8.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Peter feasts on Mr. McGregor's vegetables]]\n\nPotter asserted that her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the \"longevity of her books comes from strategy\", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald.<ref name=\"Mac128\">MacDonald 1986, p. 128</ref> She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.<ref>Lear 2008, pp. 172\u20135</ref>\n\nConsiderable variations to the original format and version of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'', as well as spin-off merchandise, have been made available over the decades. Variant versions include \"pop-ups, toy theatres, and lift-the-flap books\". By 1998, modern technology had made available \"videos, audio cassette, a CD-ROM, a computer program, and Internet sites\", as described by Margaret Mackey writing in ''The case of Peter Rabbit: changing conditions of literature for children''. She continues: \"Warne and their collaborators and competitors have produced a large collection of activity books and a monthly educational magazine\". A plethora of other Peter Rabbit related merchandise exists, and  \"toy shops in the United States and Britain have whole sections of [the] store specially signposted and earmarked exclusively for Potter-related toys and merchandise\".<ref name=\"MackeyPxxi-xxii\" />\n\nUnauthorized copying of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' has flourished over the decades, including products only loosely associated with the original. In 1916, American Louise A. Field cashed in on the popularity by writing books such as ''Peter Rabbit Goes to School'' and ''Peter Rabbit and His Ma'', the illustrations of which showed him in his distinctive blue jacket.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hallinan|2002|p=83}}</ref> In an animated movie by [[Golden Films]], ''The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit'', \"Peter is given buck teeth, an American accent and a fourth sister Hopsy.\" Another video \"retelling of the tale casts Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus.\"<ref name=\"MackeyPxxi-xxii\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|1998|pp=xxi\u2013xxii}}</ref>\n\n==Literary praise==\nWriting in ''Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival'', in discussing the difference between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit is a story created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. He goes on to write that the writing style\u2014\"the economy of words, the crisp writing\"\u2014lends itself well to a young audience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ross|1996|p=210}}</ref>\n\nLear writes that Potter \"had in fact created a new form of animal [[fable]] in: one in which [[anthropomorphic]] animals behave as real animals with true animal instincts\", and a form of fable with anatomically correct illustrations drawn by a scientifically minded artist. She further states Peter Rabbit's nature is familiar to rabbit enthusiasts \"and endorsed by those who are not ... because her portrayal speaks to some universal understanding of rabbity behaviour.\"<ref name=\"LearP153\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=153}}</ref> She describes the tale as a \"perfect marriage of word and image\" and \"a triumph of fantasy and fact\".<ref name=\"LearP154\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n[[File:PeterRabbit15.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. McGregor tries to trap Peter under a garden sieve]]\n\nAccording to Stuart Jeffries, \"...psychoanalytic critiques of her work have multiplied since her death in 1943.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/07/booksforchildrenandteenagers Jeffries, Stuart. \"The ugly truth about Peter Rabbit ...\", ''The Guardian'', December 7, 2006]</ref> Carole Scott writes in ''Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit'' that the reader cannot help but identify with rebellious little Peter and his plight as all the illustrations are presented from his low-to-the-ground view, most feature Peter in close-up and within touching distance, and Mr. McGregor is distanced from the reader by always being depicted on the far side of Peter. Scott explains: \"This identification dramatically instills fear and tension in the reader, and interacts with the frequently distanced voice of the verbal narrative\", sometimes with contradictory effects.<ref name=\"MackeyP22\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=22}}</ref> In the verbal narrative and the illustration for the moment when Mr. McGregor attempts to trap Peter under a garden sieve, for example, the verbal narrative presents the murderous intent of Mr. McGregor as a matter-of-fact, everyday occurrence while the illustration presents the desperate moment from the terrified view of a small animal in fear of his life \u2013 a view that is reinforced by the birds that take flight to the left and the right.<ref name=\"MackeyPP22-23\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn the illustration of Peter standing by the locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident in the moment of the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, \"Peter began to cry\" is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter's emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader's identification with him.

He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts him to bed after offering him chamomile tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and [[self-publishing|privately printed]] by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by [[Frederick Warne & Co]]. in [[1902 in literature|1902]]. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages,<ref name=\"MackeyP33\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=33}}</ref> and with 45 million copies sold it is one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] in history.<ref>Worker's Press</ref>\n\nSince its release the book has generated considerable merchandise for both children and adults, including toys, dishes, foods, clothing, and videos. Potter was one of the first to be responsible for such merchandise when she patented a Peter Rabbit doll in 1903 and followed it almost immediately with a Peter Rabbit board game.\nPeter Rabbit is a favorite for children of all ages the tales of which there are many are often read to children as 'bedtime stories' They however can be enjoyed by all ages through the hit movie that was released a few years ago.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story focuses on a family of anthropomorphic rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit warns her four rabbit children, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and [[Peter Rabbit|Peter]] not to enter the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, whose wife, she tells them, put their father in a pie after he entered. Her triplets (Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail) obediently refrain from entering the garden, but Peter enters the garden to snack on some [[vegetables]]. Peter ends up eating more than what is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's [[scarecrow]]. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, after she tells him that his jacket and shoes are the second jacket and pair of shoes that he has lost in a fortnight. His mother also takes note that he was not feeling too well, and deduces that he had definitely been to Mr McGregor's garden. To cure his stomachache, Mrs. Rabbit gives him [[chamomile tea]] which is revealed to be one teaspoon and gives a dose of it to Peter. Peter's sisters, meanwhile, receive a scrumptuous dinner of milk, bread and blackberries.\n\n==Composition==\nThe story was inspired by a pet rabbit Potter had as a child, which she named Peter Piper.<ref name=\"MackeyP35\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=35}}</ref> Through the 1890s, Potter sent illustrated story letters to the children of her former [[governess]], Annie Moore. In 1900, Moore, realizing the commercial potential of Potter's stories, suggested they be made into books. Potter embraced the suggestion, and, borrowing her complete correspondence (which had been carefully preserved by the Moore children), selected a letter written on 4 September 1893 to five-year-old Noel that featured a tale about a rabbit named Peter. Potter biographer [[Linda Lear]] explains: \"The original letter was too short to make a proper book so [Potter] added some text and made new black-and-white illustrations...and made it more suspenseful. These changes slowed the narrative down, added intrigue, and gave a greater sense of the passage of time. Then she copied it out into a stiff-covered exercise book, and painted a coloured frontispiece showing Mrs Rabbit dosing Peter with camomile tea\".<ref name=\"LearP142\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=142}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Private publication===\n[[File:1901 First Edition of Peter Rabbit.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1901 privately published edition]]\nAs Lear explains, Potter titled ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden'' and sent it to publishers, but \"her manuscript was returned&nbsp;... including Frederick Warne & Co.&nbsp;... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork. Some publishers wanted a shorter book, others a longer one. But most wanted coloured illustrations which by 1900 were both popular and affordable\".<ref name=\"LearP143\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=143}}</ref> The several rejections were frustrating to Potter, who knew exactly how her book should look (she had adopted the format and style of [[Helen Bannerman]]'s ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'') \"and how much it should cost\".<ref name=\"LearP1143-144\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=143\u2013144}}</ref> She decided to publish the book herself, and on 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' were \"ready for distribution to family and friends\".<ref name=\"LearP145\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=145}}</ref>\n\n===First commercial edition===\nIn 1901, as Lear explains, a Potter family friend and sometime poet, [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], set Potter's tale into \"rather dreadful didactic verse and submitted it, along with Potter's illustrations and half her revised manuscript, to Frederick Warne & Co.,\" who had been among the original rejecters.<ref name=\"LearP145-146\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=145\u2013146}}</ref> Warne editors declined Rawnsley's version \"but asked to see the complete Potter manuscript\" \u2013 their interest stimulated by the opportunity ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' offered the publisher to compete with the success of Helen Bannerman's wildly popular ''Little Black Sambo'' and other small-format children's books then on the market. When Warne inquired about the lack of colour illustrations in the book, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green were not good subjects for colouration. Warne declined the book but left open the possibility of future publication.<ref name=\"LearP146\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=146}}</ref>\n\nWarne wanted colour illustrations throughout the \"bunny book\" (as the firm referred to the tale) and suggested cutting the illustrations \"from forty-two to thirty-two ... and marked which ones might best be eliminated\".<ref name=\"LearP146\" /> Potter initially resisted the idea of colour illustrations, but then realized her stubborn stance was a mistake. She sent Warne \"several colour illustrations, along with a copy of her privately printed edition\" which Warne then handed to their eminent children's book illustrator [[L. Leslie Brooke]] for his professional opinion. Brooke was impressed with Potter's work. Fortuitously, his recommendation coincided with a sudden surge in the small picture-book market.<ref name=\"LearP147\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=147}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Potter continued to distribute her privately printed edition to family and friends, with the celebrated creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], acquiring a copy for his children. When the first private printing of 250 copies was sold out, another 200 were prepared.<ref name=\"LearP150\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=150}}</ref> She noted in an inscription in one copy that her beloved pet rabbit Peter had died.<ref name=\"LearP149\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=149}}</ref>\n\nPotter arrived at an agreement with Warne for an initial commercial publication of 5,000 copies.<ref name=\"LearP148\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=148}}</ref> Negotiations dragged on into the following year, but a contract was finally signed in June 1902.<ref name=\"LearP149\" /> Potter was closely involved in the publication of the commercial edition \u2013 redrawing where necessary, making minor adjustments to the prose and correcting punctuation. The blocks for the illustrations and text were sent to [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] [[Edmund Evans]] for [[Wood engraving|engraving]], and she made adjustments to the [[Galley proof|proofs]] when she received them. Lear writes that \"Even before the publication of the tale in early October 1902, the first 8,000 copies were sold out. By the year's end there were 28,000 copies of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in print. By the middle of 1903 there was a fifth edition sporting coloured endpapers ... a sixth printing was produced within the month\"; and a year after the first commercial publication there were 56,470 copies in print.<ref name=\"LearP152\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=152}}</ref>\n\n===American copyright===\nWarne's New York office \"failed to register the [[copyright]] for ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' in the United States\"{{citequote}}, and [[License|unlicensed]] copies of the book \"(from which Potter would receive no [[royalties]]) began to appear in the spring of 1903. There was nothing anyone could do to stop them\".{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\nThe enormous financial loss \"... [to Potter] only became evident over time\"{{citequote}}.  The necessity of protecting her intellectual property hit home after the successful 1903 publication of ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' when her father returned from [[Burlington Arcade]] in [[Mayfair]] at Christmas 1903 with a toy squirrel labelled \"Nutkin\".<ref name=\"LearP164\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=164}}</ref><!--this part really doesn't have to do with the American copyright-->\n\n==Merchandising==\n[[File:PeterRabbit8.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Peter feasts on Mr. McGregor's vegetables]]\n\nPotter asserted that her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the \"longevity of her books comes from strategy\", writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald.<ref name=\"Mac128\">MacDonald 1986, p. 128</ref> She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy, an unpublished board game, and nursery wallpaper.<ref>Lear 2008, pp. 172\u20135</ref>\n\nConsiderable variations to the original format and version of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'', as well as spin-off merchandise, have been made available over the decades. Variant versions include \"pop-ups, toy theatres, and lift-the-flap books\". By 1998, modern technology had made available \"videos, audio cassette, a CD-ROM, a computer program, and Internet sites\", as described by Margaret Mackey writing in ''The case of Peter Rabbit: changing conditions of literature for children''. She continues: \"Warne and their collaborators and competitors have produced a large collection of activity books and a monthly educational magazine\". A plethora of other Peter Rabbit related merchandise exists, and  \"toy shops in the United States and Britain have whole sections of [the] store specially signposted and earmarked exclusively for Potter-related toys and merchandise\".<ref name=\"MackeyPxxi-xxii\" />\n\nUnauthorized copying of ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' has flourished over the decades, including products only loosely associated with the original. In 1916, American Louise A. Field cashed in on the popularity by writing books such as ''Peter Rabbit Goes to School'' and ''Peter Rabbit and His Ma'', the illustrations of which showed him in his distinctive blue jacket.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hallinan|2002|p=83}}</ref> In an animated movie by [[Golden Films]], ''The New Adventures of Peter Rabbit'', \"Peter is given buck teeth, an American accent and a fourth sister Hopsy.\" Another video \"retelling of the tale casts Peter as a Christian preacher singing songs about God and Jesus.\"<ref name=\"MackeyPxxi-xxii\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|1998|pp=xxi\u2013xxii}}</ref>\n\n==Literary praise==\nWriting in ''Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival'', in discussing the difference between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit is a story created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. He goes on to write that the writing style\u2014\"the economy of words, the crisp writing\"\u2014lends itself well to a young audience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ross|1996|p=210}}</ref>\n\nLear writes that Potter \"had in fact created a new form of animal [[fable]] in: one in which [[anthropomorphic]] animals behave as real animals with true animal instincts\", and a form of fable with anatomically correct illustrations drawn by a scientifically minded artist. She further states Peter Rabbit's nature is familiar to rabbit enthusiasts \"and endorsed by those who are not ... because her portrayal speaks to some universal understanding of rabbity behaviour.\"<ref name=\"LearP153\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|p=153}}</ref> She describes the tale as a \"perfect marriage of word and image\" and \"a triumph of fantasy and fact\".<ref name=\"LearP154\">{{Harvnb|Lear|2007|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n[[File:PeterRabbit15.jpg|thumb|left|Mr. McGregor tries to trap Peter under a garden sieve]]\n\nAccording to Stuart Jeffries, \"...psychoanalytic critiques of her work have multiplied since her death in 1943.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/07/booksforchildrenandteenagers Jeffries, Stuart. \"The ugly truth about Peter Rabbit ...\", ''The Guardian'', December 7, 2006]</ref> Carole Scott writes in ''Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit'' that the reader cannot help but identify with rebellious little Peter and his plight as all the illustrations are presented from his low-to-the-ground view, most feature Peter in close-up and within touching distance, and Mr. McGregor is distanced from the reader by always being depicted on the far side of Peter. Scott explains: \"This identification dramatically instills fear and tension in the reader, and interacts with the frequently distanced voice of the verbal narrative\", sometimes with contradictory effects.<ref name=\"MackeyP22\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=22}}</ref> In the verbal narrative and the illustration for the moment when Mr. McGregor attempts to trap Peter under a garden sieve, for example, the verbal narrative presents the murderous intent of Mr. McGregor as a matter-of-fact, everyday occurrence while the illustration presents the desperate moment from the terrified view of a small animal in fear of his life \u2013 a view that is reinforced by the birds that take flight to the left and the right.<ref name=\"MackeyPP22-23\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn the illustration of Peter standing by the locked door, the verbal narrative describes the scene without the flippancy evident in the moment of the sieve. The inability to overcome obstacles is presented in the verbal narrative with objective matter-of-factness and the statement, \"Peter began to cry\" is offered without irony or attitude, thus drawing the reader closer to Peter's emotions and plight. The illustration depicts an unclothed Peter standing upright against the door, one foot upon the other with a tear running from his eye. Without his clothes, Peter is only a small, wild animal but his tears, his emotions, and his human posture intensifies the reader's identification with him. Here, verbal narrative and illustration work in harmony rather than in disharmony.<ref name=\"MackeyP26\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=26}}</ref> Scott suggests Potter's tale has encouraged many generations of children to \"self-indulgence, disobedience, transgression of social boundaries and ethics, and assertion of their wild, unpredictable nature against the constrictions of civilized living.\"<ref name=\"MackeyP29\">{{Harvnb|Mackey|2002|p=29}}</ref>\n\nFrank Delaney notes \"a self-containment\" in Potter's writing reflective of an uninterested mother and a lonely childhood spent in the company of pets.<ref>[http://publicdomainreview.org/2014/07/23/the-tale-of-beatrix-potter/ Delaney, Frank. \"The Tale of Beatrix Potter\", ''The public Domain Review'']</ref> John Bidwell, curator at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, observed \"...the sardonic humor that makes Beatrix Potter so much fun for kids and grown-ups.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/arts/television/peter-rabbit-on-nickelodeon-for-christmas-then-as-series.html Chozick, Amy. \"Bet Your Camomile Tea, Peter, You\u2019re a TV Star Now\", ''The New York Times'', December 5, 2012]</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nIn 1938, shortly after the success of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', [[Walt Disney]] became interested in making an animated film based on ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''.

In the 10th century, the Tsar Samuil built the fortress and church of [[Achillius of Larissa|St. Achillius]] on an island called Agios Achillios in the Small Prespa Lake, on the Greek side of the border. The biggest island in the Great Prespa Lake, within North Macedonia, is called [[Golem Grad]] (\"Large Town\"), and Snake Island (Zmiski Ostrov). The other island [[Mal Grad]] (\"Small Town\", in Albania) is the site of a ruined 14th century monastery dedicated to [[St. Peter]]. Today, both islands are uninhabited.\n\nBecause Great Prespa Lake sits in limestone country about 150m above [[Lake Ohrid]], which lies only about {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} (6 miles) to the west, the only outlets for its waters are through underground channels in the [[karst]] and emerge from [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] which feed streams running into Lake Ohrid.<ref>Thomas Wilke, Risto V\u00e4inol\u00e4, Frank Riedel (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqRToWKR8xkC&pg=PA107&dq=prespa+topography&hl=cs&ei=xzB2Tc-HMeXo0gHF-YjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=prespa%20topography&f=false ''Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4\u20138, 2006 (Developments in Hydrobiology)]'', p. 107, Springer, {{ISBN|1-4020-9581-3}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Greek part of the Prespa Lakes region was an underpopulated, military sensitive area which required special permission for outsiders to visit. It saw fierce fighting during the [[Greek Civil War]] and much of the local population subsequently emigrated to escape endemic poverty and political strife. The region remained little developed until the 1970s, when it began to be promoted as a tourist destination. With an abundance of rare fauna and flora, the area was declared a Transnational Park in 2000.  In 1999 the Society for the Protection of Prespa received the [[Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award]] for its conservation efforts regarding the Lake Prespa [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site, and was eventually included on 3 July 2013.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0433\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 -17.06.2018, \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0430- (42853678821).jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Zoran Zaev]] and [[Alexis Tsipras]] in [[Ote\u0161evo]], [[North Macedonia]] after signing the Prespa agreement]]\nIn 2018, Great Prespa Lake was the setting for the signing of the [[Prespa Agreement]], intended to resolve the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] by renaming the Republic of Macedonia to [[North Macedonia]].<ref name=\"2018FinalAgreement\">{{cite document|url=http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/symfwnia-aggliko-keimeno.pdf|title=FINAL AGREEMENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DIFFERENCES AS DESCRIBED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 817 (1993) AND 845 (1993), THE TERMINATION OF THE INTERIM ACCORD OF 1995, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES |work=Kathimerini|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>.

The majority of foreign tourism has been clustered around the sister lake, Ohrid, where there are abundant overnight accommodations, restaurants and a lively town center in the summer months. Lake Prespa has subsequently remained somewhat isolated and pastoral, bringing its own special attraction in current times. The area remains pristine, without the hustle and bustle of a tourist town and a distinct lack of concrete and pollution which usually comes with developing tourism. Waterfront developments with sophisticated cafes serving food and drinks such as \"Connect Beach\" in the village of Slivnica, however, are providing a way for visitors to spend the day on the lake in luxury, without impacting on the environment. Companies such ''Prespa Panorama'' based in North Macedonia are leading the development of overnight lodging for the region with a concept of low environmental impact, low volume accommodations in the region. The municipality of Resen has begun construction of a paved walking and biking path that will link the individual villages providing access for a walking or biking tour of the numerous villages that are scattered around the lake. The completed concept will allow individuals to explore the entire south western corner of North Macedonia including Pelister and Galicica, two of the most beautiful and scenic mountain peaks of the region on foot or by bicycle. A descent from Galicica on the western face brings the cyclist or hiker down to the most scenic part of Lake Ohrid, which is separated from Lake Prespa by its massif. Once on the Lake Ohrid side, the springs where the waters of Lake Prespa emerge from under the mountain and drain into Lake Ohrid can be enjoyed.\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Prespa, Lake\".

In the 10th century, the Tsar Samuil built the fortress and church of [[Achillius of Larissa|St. Achillius]] on an island called Agios Achillios in the Small Prespa Lake, on the Greek side of the border. The biggest island in the Great Prespa Lake, on the side of North Macedonia, is called [[Golem Grad]] (\"Large Town\"), and Snake Island (Zmiski Ostrov). The other island [[Mal Grad]] (\"Small Town\", in Albania) is the site of a ruined 14th century monastery dedicated to [[St. Peter]]. Today, both islands are uninhabited.\n\nBecause Great Prespa Lake sits about 150m above [[Lake Ohrid]], which lies only about {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} (6 miles) to the west, its waters run through underground channels in the [[karst]] and emerge from [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] which feed streams running into Lake Ohrid.<ref>Thomas Wilke, Risto V\u00e4inol\u00e4, Frank Riedel (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqRToWKR8xkC&pg=PA107&dq=prespa+topography&hl=cs&ei=xzB2Tc-HMeXo0gHF-YjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=prespa%20topography&f=false ''Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4\u20138, 2006 (Developments in Hydrobiology)]'', p. 107, Springer, {{ISBN|1-4020-9581-3}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Greek part of the Prespa Lakes region was an underpopulated, military sensitive area which required special permission for outsiders to visit. It saw fierce fighting during the [[Greek Civil War]] and much of the local population subsequently emigrated to escape endemic poverty and political strife. The region remained little developed until the 1970s, when it began to be promoted as a tourist destination. With an abundance of rare fauna and flora, the area was declared a Transnational Park in 2000.  In 1999 the Society for the Protection of Prespa received the [[Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award]] for its conservation efforts regarding the Lake Prespa [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site, and was eventually included on 3 July 2013.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0433\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 -17.06.2018, \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0430- (42853678821).jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Zoran Zaev]] and [[Alexis Tsipras]] in [[Ote\u0161evo]], [[North Macedonia]] after signing the Prespa agreement]]\nIn 2018, Great Prespa Lake was the setting for the signing of the [[Prespa Agreement]], intended to resolve the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] by renaming the Republic of Macedonia to [[North Macedonia]].<ref name=\"2018FinalAgreement\">{{cite document|url=http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/symfwnia-aggliko-keimeno.pdf|title=FINAL AGREEMENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DIFFERENCES AS DESCRIBED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 817 (1993) AND 845 (1993), THE TERMINATION OF THE INTERIM ACCORD OF 1995, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES |work=Kathimerini|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>.

The majority of foreign tourism has been clustered around the sister lake, Ohrid, where there are abundant overnight accommodations, restaurants and a lively town center in the summer months. Lake Prespa has subsequently remained somewhat isolated and pastoral, bringing its own special attraction in current times. The area remains pristine, without the hustle and bustle of a tourist town and a distinct lack of concrete and pollution which usually comes with developing tourism. Waterfront developments with sophisticated cafes serving food and drinks such as \"Connect Beach\" in the village of Slivnica, however, are providing a way for visitors to spend the day on the lake in luxury, without impacting on the environment. Companies such ''Prespa Panorama'' based in North Macedonia are leading the development of overnight lodging for the region with a concept of low environmental impact, low volume accommodations in the region. The municipality of Resen has begun construction of a paved walking and biking path that will link the individual villages providing access for a walking or biking tour of the numerous villages that are scattered around the lake. The completed concept will allow individuals to explore the entire south western corner of North Macedonia including Pelister and Galicica, two of the most beautiful and scenic mountain peaks of the region on foot or by bicycle. A descent from Galicica on the western face brings the cyclist or hiker down to the most scenic part of Lake Ohrid, which is separated from Lake Prespa by its massif. Once on the Lake Ohrid side, the springs where the waters of Lake Prespa emerge from under the mountain and drain into Lake Ohrid can be enjoyed.\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Prespa, Lake\".

{"title_page": "Frequent-flyer program", "text_new": "{{distinguish|text = the sleep deprivation technique [[Frequent flyer program (Guantanamo)]]}}\nA '''frequent-flyer program''' ('''FFP''') is a [[loyalty program]] offered by an [[airline]].\n\nMany airlines have frequent-flyer programs designed to encourage airline customers enrolled in the program to accumulate points (also called miles, kilometers, or segments) which may then be redeemed for [[air travel]] or other rewards. Points earned under FFPs may be based on the class of fare, distance flown on that airline or its partners, or the amount paid. There are other ways to earn points. For example, in recent years, more points have been earned by using co-branded credit and debit cards than by air travel. Another way to earn points is spending money at associated retail outlets, car hire companies, hotels, or other associated businesses. Points can be redeemed for air travel, other goods or services, or for increased benefits, such as travel class upgrades, [[airport lounge]] access, fast track access, or priority bookings.\n\nFrequent-flyer programs can be seen as a certain type of [[virtual currency]], one with unidirectional flow of money to purchase points, but no exchange back into money.<ref name=ECB>{{cite book|title=Virtual Currency Schemes|date=October 2012|publisher=European Central Bank|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-92-899-0862-7|page=5|chapter-url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|author=European Central Bank|accessdate=5 March 2014|chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough [[United Airlines]] had tracked customers far back as the 1950s, the very first modern frequent-flyer program was created in 1972 by Western Direct Marketing for United. It gave plaques and promotional materials to members. In 1979, [[Texas International Airlines]] created the first frequent-flyer program that used mileage tracking to give 'rewards' to its passengers, while in 1980 [[Western Airlines]] created its Travel Bank, which ultimately became part of [[Delta Air Lines]]' program upon their merger in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thetravelinsider.info/airlinemismanagement/airlinederegulation2.htm|title=A History of US Airline Deregulation Part 4 : 1979 - 2010 : The Effects of Deregulation - Lower Fares, More Travel, Frequent Flier Programs |author=David M Rowell |date=August 13, 2010 |publisher=The Travel Insider|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://milecards.com/7006/screen-shot-from-the-very-first-frequent-mile-program/ |title=Screen shot from the very first frequent mile program |publisher=Milecards |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> [[American Airlines]]' [[AAdvantage]] program launched in 1981 as a modification of a never-realized concept from 1979 that would have given special fares to frequent customers.

Many discount airlines, rather than awarding points per mile, award points for flight segments in lieu of distance or the amount paid. For example, a number of airlines in Europe offer a fixed number of points for domestic or intra-European flights regardless of the distance (but varied according to class of travel).<ref>[http://www.miles-and-more.com/cdautils/mediapool/media_479895.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029033038/http://www.miles-and-more.com/cdautils/mediapool/media_479895.pdf|date=October 29, 2007}}</ref> With the introduction of [[airline alliance]]s and [[code sharing|code-share flights]], frequent-flyer programs are often extended to allow benefits to be used across partner airlines.<ref>Bilotkach, V. 2009.

While these bonus points don't count toward ascension to (or retention of) elite status, they count toward the member's total balance for normal redemption purposes.\n\n====Minimum credit guarantee====\nSome programs award a full 500 points (or a similar minimum credit guarantee) for non-stop flights spanning less than 500 miles. An airline's program can either award this guarantee to all members regardless of elite status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/mileage-plan/earn-use-miles/earn-on-alaska.aspx |title=Earning Miles on Alaska Airlines - Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan |publisher=Alaskaair.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref> or they can reserve this privilege only for their elite members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/mileageplus/premier/bonuses.aspx |title=United Airlines - Premier Mileage Bonuses |publisher=United.com |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Credit card purchases ===\nMany credit card companies partner with airlines to offer a co-branded credit card or the ability to transfer points in their loyalty program to an airline's program. Large sign-up bonuses and other incentives are common. Accruing points via credit cards bonuses and spending allows infrequent travelers to benefit from the frequent flyer program.\n\nWith a non-affiliated travel rewards credit card a cardmember can buy a positive-space ticket considered \"revenue\" class, which can earn the passenger points with the airline flown.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vUfXUJ9s3-wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=travel+detective#v=onepage&q=travel%20detective&f=false|author= Greenberg, Peter|title=The Travel Detective|year= 2005|publisher=Random House|accessdate=12 August 2014|isbn= 9781588361288}}</ref>\n\n===Other purchases===\nFrequent-flyer programs may offer points through other means, such as purchasing food or merchandise sold by an affiliated company.

Unlike most previous research on FFPs, this research used data from an actual FFP. The cash-equivalent value of a loyalty point in 2010 was estimated to range between AU$0.0066 and AU$0.0084. This range however excluded the value of status benefits to the status member. The loyalty point gained by a FFP member per flight equated to an in-kind discount on an average airfare of 3.3% for lowest status members, 3.96% for medium status members and 4.63% for premium status members. A detailed survey undertaken in 2010 among a representative sample of over 3300 members of that specific FFP showed that a large proportion of leisure and business travelers admitted a willingness to pay a higher fare - a FFP premium - to fly with the sponsoring airline because of their FFP membership. The average FFP premium was estimated to be around 8% and was statistically different between leisure and business travelers. The cash-equivalent value of a loyalty point as encapsulated in the FFP premium was estimated to range between AU$0.0108 and AU$0.0153, depending on the FFP status of a member.<ref name=\"McCaughey2014\">McCaughey, N.C.

It can however be argued that since the cash-equivalent value of loyalty currency can be reasonably estimated with public data, this value is appropriate as a tax base. Hurdles preventing the taxation of FFP rewards are generally less related to the technical issue of valuation, but have more to do with legal constraints (e.g. \"who owns the points\") and often a lack of political will (e.g. \"who would lose out due to taxation\").<ref name=\"McCaughey2014\"/> Australian and German public servants are not permitted to redeem points accrued from official travel for private purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct-in-practice |title=APS Values and Code of Conduct in practice |publisher=Apsc.gov.au |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2012-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116014859/http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct-in-practice |archivedate=2012-11-16 }}</ref> The Australian example occurred in the 1990s when Qantas and the now-defunct Ansett Australia competed for the Australian federal government travel contract; this was put forward as a system requirement for the competing companies in order to win the contract.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn the US, the [[General Services Administration]] has regulated, \"frequent traveler benefits earned [by federal employees] in connection with official travel, [which] may be used only for official travel, see 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 301-1.6(f).\"<ref name=\"OGE\">{{cite web|author1=Stephen D.

Unlike most previous research on FFPs, this research used data from an actual FFP. The cash-equivalent value of a loyalty point in 2010 was estimated to range between AU$0.0066 and AU$0.0084. This range however excluded the value of status benefits to the status member. The loyalty point gained by a FFP member per flight equated to an in-kind discount on an average airfare of 3.3% for lowest status members, 3.96% for medium status members and 4.63% for premium status members. A detailed survey undertaken in 2010 among a representative sample of over 3300 members of that specific FFP showed that a large proportion of leisure and business travelers admitted a willingness to pay a higher fare - a FFP premium - to fly with the sponsoring airline because of their FFP membership. The average FFP premium was estimated to be around 8% and was statistically different between leisure and business travelers. The cash-equivalent value of a loyalty point as encapsulated in the FFP premium was estimated to range between AU$0.0108 and AU$0.0153, depending on the FFP status of a member.<ref name=\"McCaughey2014\">McCaughey, N.C.

This has raised concerns that the company is providing a [[tax]]-free benefit (point-based awards) to employees,<ref name=\"McCaughey2014\"/> or that employees have misappropriated value that belongs to the company, or even that the rewards acts as a kind of [[bribe]] to encourage travelers to choose one particular airline or travel unnecessarily. Most companies consider the miles earned by their employees to be a valuable personal perk that in part compensates for the daily grind of frequent business travel, though some governmental organizations have attempted to prevent their employees from accumulating miles on official travel.<ref>Cunningham, J.

It can however be argued that since the cash-equivalent value of loyalty currency can be reasonably estimated with public data, this value is appropriate as a tax base. Hurdles preventing the taxation of FFP rewards are generally less related to the technical issue of valuation, but have more to do with legal constraints (e.g. \"who owns the points\") and often a lack of political will (e.g. \"who would lose out due to taxation\").<ref name=\"McCaughey2014\"/> Australian and German public servants are not permitted to redeem points accrued from official travel for private purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct-in-practice |title=APS Values and Code of Conduct in practice |publisher=Apsc.gov.au |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2012-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116014859/http://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-employment-policy-and-advice/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct/aps-values-and-code-of-conduct-in-practice |archivedate=2012-11-16 }}</ref> The Australian example occurred in the 1990s when Qantas and the now-defunct Ansett Australia competed for the Australian federal government travel contract; this was put forward as a system requirement for the competing companies in order to win the contract.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn the US, the [[General Services Administration]] has regulated, \"frequent traveler benefits earned [by federal employees] in connection with official travel, [which] may be used only for official travel, see 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 301-1.6(f).\"<ref name=\"OGE\">{{cite web|author1=Stephen D.

The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>}</code>.  Both the symbol and the sound are commonly referred to as \"barred u\".\n\nThe close central rounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the rare [[labialized post-palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u1e85]}}.<ref>Instead of \"post-palatal\", it can be called \"retracted palatal\", \"backed palatal\", \"palato-velar\", \"pre-velar\", \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\" or \"front-velar\".</ref>\n\nIn most languages this rounded vowel is pronounced with [[roundedness|protruded lips]] (''endolabial''). However, in a few cases the lips are compressed (''exolabial'').\n\nSome languages feature the '''near-close central rounded vowel''', which is slightly lower. It is most often transcribed in IPA with {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u031e}} and {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u0308}}, but other transcriptions such as {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u031f}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0275\u031d}} are also possible. The symbol {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}}, a conflation of {{angbr IPA|\u028a}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, is used as an unofficial extension of the IPA to represent this sound by a number of publications, such as ''Accents of English'' by [[John C. Wells]]. In the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}} represents [[free variation]] between {{IPA|/\u028a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n\n==Close central protruded vowel==\nThe '''close central protruded vowel''' is typically transcribed in IPA simply as {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated [[IPA diacritic|diacritic]] for protrusion in the IPA, symbol for the close central rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, {{angbr IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u032b}}, can be used as an ''ad hoc'' symbol {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u032b}} for the close central protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u02b7}} or {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u02b7}} (a close central vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.\n\n===Features===\n{{close vowel}}\n{{central vowel}}\n{{protruded vowel}}\n\n===Occurrence===\nBecause central rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear: both;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!

central rounded vowel (vector).svg\n|imagesize=150px\n|braille=356\n|braille2=u\n}}\n{{IPA vowels|class=floatright}}\n\nThe '''close central rounded vowel''', or '''high central rounded vowel''',<ref>{{Vowel terminology}}</ref> is a type of [[vowel]] sound used in some spoken [[language]]s. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>}</code>.  Both the symbol and the sound are commonly referred to as \"barred u\".\n\nThe close central rounded vowel is the vocalic equivalent of the rare [[labialized post-palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u1e85]}}.<ref>Instead of \"post-palatal\", it can be called \"retracted palatal\", \"backed palatal\", \"palato-velar\", \"pre-velar\", \"advanced velar\", \"fronted velar\" or \"front-velar\".</ref>\n\nIn most languages this rounded vowel is pronounced with [[roundedness|protruded lips]] (''endolabial''). However, in a few cases the lips are compressed (''exolabial'').\n\nSome languages feature the '''near-close central rounded vowel''', which is slightly lower. It is most often transcribed in IPA with {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u031e}} and {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u0308}}, but other transcriptions such as {{angbr IPA|\u028a\u031f}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0275\u031d}} are also possible. The symbol {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}}, a conflation of {{angbr IPA|\u028a}} and {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, is used as an unofficial extension of the IPA to represent this sound by a number of publications, such as ''Accents of English'' by [[John C. Wells]]. In the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{angbr IPA|\u1d7f}} represents [[free variation]] between {{IPA|/\u028a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n\n==Close central protruded vowel==\nThe '''close central protruded vowel''' is typically transcribed in IPA simply as {{angbr IPA|\u0289}}, and that is the convention used in this article. As there is no dedicated [[IPA diacritic|diacritic]] for protrusion in the IPA, symbol for the close central rounded vowel with an old diacritic for labialization, {{angbr IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u032b}}, can be used as an ''ad hoc'' symbol {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u032b}} for the close central protruded vowel. Another possible transcription is {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u02b7}} or {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u02b7}} (a close central vowel modified by endolabialization), but this could be misread as a diphthong.\n\n===Features===\n{{close vowel}}\n{{central vowel}}\n{{protruded vowel}}\n\n===Occurrence===\nBecause central rounded vowels are assumed to have protrusion, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have compression.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear: both;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
