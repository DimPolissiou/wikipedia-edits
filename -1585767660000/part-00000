In the following years, [[PIA Planetarium, Karachi|PIA Planetarium]] was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in [[PIA Planetarium, Lahore|Lahore]] and [[PIA Planetarium, Peshawar|Peshawar]]. These planetariums featured retired PIA aircraft on display for educational or observational purposes. Two more retired Boeing 720B aircraft were donated to the planetariums in Karachi and Lahore later on.

In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]] aircraft - with the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to [[Tashkent]] in 1992 and to Z\u00fcrich in 1993.\n\nIn March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An [[Open Skies]] agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].\n\nA [[Tupolev Tu-154]] aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.\n\n==== 2000s ====\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Boeing 747-367, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA AN0367768.jpg\n| caption1 = PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] on short final to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow International Airport]], circa 2003.\n| image2 = Boeing 777-240(ER), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) JP5656886.jpg\n| caption2 = PIA [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] taking off from [[Manchester Airport]], circa 2006.\n| width = \n}}\n\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] following the attacks on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, following restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000-3, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.\n\nBoeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven [[ATR 42]]-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes<ref name=\":19\" /> - a record which still stands as of late 2019.<ref name=\":20\" /> On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777]]-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the [[PIA Flight 688]] accident.\n\nWith the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], and [[Houston]] but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.\n\nA PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45.

The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism, the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. The tail logo was replaced by a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. The \"Pakistan\" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.\n\n[[File:Boeing 747-300 (PIA) (5299437361).jpg|thumb|A PIA Boeing 747-300 painted in a ''Frontier'' livery]]\nIn early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The \"Frontier\" tail represented the \"Phulkari\" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The \"Punjab\" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The \"Balochistan\" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The \"Sindh\" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.\n\nPIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.\n\nIn July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a \"crescent and star\" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.\n\n[[File:PIA Markhor Livery.png|thumb|In 2018, Pakistan's national animal Markhor was chosen to be introduced as the brand identity on aircraft tail, however later the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] took ''suo motu'' action and barred PIA from using the Markhor as brand identity, only one Airbus A320 was painted in the livery.]]\nIn April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the [[Markhor]] in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the \"PIA\" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. [[Urdu]] PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to \"''We Fly at the Right Attitude''\" from \"Great People to Fly With\". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hanger by the method of decals to make a debut at the [[Islamabad International Airport|New Islamabad International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399780|title=First plane to land at new Islamabad airport tomorrow|last=Asghar|first=Mohammad|date=6 April 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Asghar|first1=Mohammad|title=PIA planes get a facelift|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1400035|work=Dawn|date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ''suo motu'' notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case.

In the following years, [[PIA Planetarium, Karachi|PIA Planetarium]] was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in [[PIA Planetarium, Lahore|Lahore]] and [[PIA Planetarium, Peshawar|Peshawar]].

In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]] aircraft - with the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to [[Tashkent]] in 1992 and to Z\u00fcrich in 1993.\n\nIn March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An [[Open Skies]] agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the [[Karakoram Mountains]] in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, [[Fujairah]], [[Baku]] and [[Al-Ain]] to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].\n\nA [[Tupolev Tu-154]] aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]] to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.\n\n==== 2000s ====\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Boeing 747-367, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA AN0367768.jpg\n| caption1 = PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] on short final to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow International Airport]], circa 2003.\n| image2 = Boeing 777-240(ER), Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) JP5656886.jpg\n| caption2 = PIA [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] taking off from [[Manchester Airport]], circa 2006.\n| width = \n}}\n\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] following the attacks on [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]] negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, following restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.<ref name=\":10\" /> Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000-3, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn July 2002, PIA purchased six [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] aircraft from [[Cathay Pacific]], five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterwards and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight [[Boeing 777]] aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.\n\nBoeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven [[ATR 42]]-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes<ref name=\":19\" /> - a record which still stands as of late 2019.<ref name=\":20\" /> On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first [[Boeing 777]]-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.\n\nOn 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the [[PIA Flight 688]] accident.\n\nWith the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from [[Toronto]] to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], and [[Houston]] but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.\n\nA PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45.

The government announced its privatisation plans but they were never implemented. Several steps towards outsourcing of non-core business have been initiated. Catering units (starting with Karachi Flight Kitchen), ground handling (starting with ramp services) and engineering, are to be gradually carved out of the airline and operated as independent companies. During 1997, Pakistan called in a team from [[International Finance]] (IFC), the consulting arm of the [[World Bank]], to advise on restructuring and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).

The \"Pakistan\" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.\n\n[[File:Boeing 747-300 (PIA) (5299437361).jpg|thumb|A PIA Boeing 747-300 painted in a ''Frontier'' livery]]\nIn early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The \"Frontier\" tail represented the \"Phulkari\" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The \"Punjab\" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore. The \"Balochistan\" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The \"Sindh\" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.\n\nPIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.\n\nIn July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a \"crescent and star\" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.\n\n[[File:PIA Markhor Livery.png|thumb|In 2018, Pakistan's national animal Markhor was chosen to be introduced as the brand identity on aircraft tail, however later the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] took ''suo motu'' action and barred PIA from using the Markhor as brand identity, only one Airbus A320 was painted in the livery.]]\nIn April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the [[Markhor]] in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the \"PIA\" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. [[Urdu]] PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to \"''We Fly at the Right Attitude''\" from \"Great People to Fly With\". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hanger by the method of decals to make a debut at the [[Islamabad International Airport|New Islamabad International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1399780|title=First plane to land at new Islamabad airport tomorrow|last=Asghar|first=Mohammad|date=6 April 2018|work=Dawn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Asghar|first1=Mohammad|title=PIA planes get a facelift|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1400035|work=Dawn|date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ''suo motu'' notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case. However, with management change, the re-branding was abandoned altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/67193-pia-secures-limited-govt-funding-but-barred-from-rebranding|title=PIA secures limited gov't funding but barred from rebranding}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/258919/pia-rebranding-aims-to-rectify-errors-build-global-image/|title=PIA rebranding aims to rectify errors, build global image \u2013 Daily Times|date=27 June 2018}}</ref> Currently, the airline is operating a hybrid livery which features a euro-white fuselage and gold Urdu logo in-front of the front exits and engine cowling while the flag tail, English PIA (and Pakistan International in gold) titles in dark green and Pakistan titles in dark green on the belly have been retained from the 2010 livery. The PIA corporate website was also added ahead of the aft exits. Currently, five Boeing 777s and three A320s are sporting this livery.\n\n=== Former fleet ===\n[[File:PIA Douglas DC-8 Gilliand.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-21]], leased in 1977-1978]]\n[[File:Airbus_A310-308,_Pakistan_International_Airlines_-_PIA_AN0562544.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Airbus A310-300]] landed at [[Germany]], [[Frankfurt Airport]] on 25 April 2004.]]\n[[File:Airbus A321-231, Pakistan International Airlines - PIA (Inter Airlines) AN1157696.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Airbus A321]] taking off from [[Islamabad Airport]] (2006)]]\n[[File:PIA Boeing 747-300 Asuspine-5.jpg|thumb|A PIA [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]] taking off from the [[Multan International Airport]] for a [[Hajj]] flight on 28 October 2010.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ \n|-\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Aircraft</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Total</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Introduced</span>\n!style=\"background:#004F30; width:150px;\"  |<span style=\"color:#AB9214;\">Retired</span>\n|-\n|[[Airbus A300B4-200]]\n|11\n|1980\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Airbus A310-300]]\n|12\n|1991\n|2016\n|-\n|[[Airbus A321-200]]\n|2\n|2006\n|2007\n|-\n|[[Airbus A330-300]]\n|3\n|2016\n|2017<ref name=\"SriLank\" />\n|-\n|[[Boeing 707-320C]]\n|13\n|1960\n|1998\n|-\n|[[Boeing 720B]]\n|9\n|1962\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n|8\n|1985\n|2014\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n|2\n|2004\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n|4\n|2014\n|2015\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747-200B]]\n|6\n|1976\n|2005\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200B Combi]]\n|2\n|1979\n|2011\n|-\n|[[Boeing 747-300]]\n|6\n|1999\n|2015\n|-\n|[[Convair CV-240 family|Convair CV-240]]\n|4\n|1955\n|1959\n|-\n|[[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]]\n|8\n|1970\n|2001\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-3]]\n|15\n|1955\n|1967\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-8-21F]]\n|1\n|1977\n|1978\n|-\n|[[Douglas DC-8|Douglas DC-61CF]]\n|1\n|1977\n|1978\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-200 Friendship]]\n|24\n|1961\n|2006\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-400 Friendship]]\n|1\n|1961\n|2003\n|-\n|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F27-600 Friendship]]\n|5\n|1966\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Hiller OH-23 Raven|Hiller UH-12E4]]\n|1\n|1963\n|1971\n|-\n|[[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Hawker Siddeley Trident 1E]]\n|4\n|1966\n|1970\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100-382B-4C Hercules]]\n|2\n|1966\n|1966\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellation]]\n|3\n|1954\n|1969\n|-\n|[[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation|Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation]]\n|2\n|1958\n|1969\n|-\n|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]]\n|5\n|1974\n|1986\n|-\n|[[Mil Mi-8|Mil Mi-8 MTV-1]]\n|1\n|1995\n|1997\n|-\n|[[Sikorsky S-61|Sikorsky S-61N]]\n|4\n|1963\n|1967\n|- \n|[[Tupolev Tu-154]]\n|4\n|1996\n|1997\n|-\n|[[Vickers Viscount|Vickers Viscount 815]]\n|5\n|1956\n|1966\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Services ==\n=== Cabin ===\nPIA operates a three-class configuration on its domestic routes: [[Business class|Business]], [[Premium Economy|Executive Economy]] and [[Economy class|Economy]].

In 865, instead of raiding, the Danes landed a large army in [[East Anglia]], with the intention of conquering the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England. The armies of various Danish leaders had come together to provide one combined force under a leadership that included [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] and [[Ivar the Boneless]], the sons of the legendary Viking leader [[Ragnar Lodbrok]].<ref name=sawyer52>Sawyer.

In 867, they captured Northumbria and its capital, York, defeating both the recently deposed King [[Osberht of Northumbria]] and the usurper [[\u00c6lla of Northumbria]]. The Danes then placed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria]], on the throne of Northumbria as a [[puppet state|puppet]] ruler.<ref>Flores Historiarum: Rogeri de Wendover, ''Chronica sive flores historiarum'', pp. 298\u201399. ed.

King [[Burgred of Mercia]] then negotiated peace with Ivar, with the Danes keeping Nottingham in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia alone.\n\nUnder Ivar the Boneless, the Danes continued their invasion in 869 by defeating King [[Edmund the Martyr|Edmund of East Anglia]] at [[Hoxne]] and conquering East Anglia.<ref>Haywood, John.

The Danes pursued, and on 7 January 871, \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeated the Danes at the [[Battle of Ashdown]]. The Danes retreated to [[Old Basing|Basing]] (in [[Hampshire]]), where \u00c6thelred attacked and was, in turn, defeated. Ivar was able to follow up this victory with another in March at [[Battle of Marton|Meretum]] (now Marton, [[Wiltshire]]).\n\nOn 23 April 871, King \u00c6thelred died and Alfred succeeded him as King of Wessex. His army was weak and he was forced to pay tribute to Ivar in order to make peace with the Danes. During this peace, the Danes turned to the north and attacked Mercia, a campaign that lasted until 874. Both the Danish leader Ivar and the Mercian leader Burgred died during this campaign. Ivar was succeeded by Guthrum, who finished the campaign against Mercia. In ten years, the Danes had gained control over East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, leaving just Wessex resisting.<ref>Carr, Michael. \"Alfred the Great Strikes Back\", p. 65. ''Military History Journal''. June 2001.</ref>\n\nGuthrum and the Danes brokered peace with Wessex in 876, when they captured the fortresses of [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] and [[Exeter]]. Alfred laid siege to the Danes, who were forced to surrender after reinforcements were lost in a storm.

From 1016 to 1035, [[Cnut the Great]] ruled over a unified English kingdom, itself the product of a resurgent Wessex, as part of his [[North Sea Empire]], together with Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Cnut was succeeded in England on his death by his son [[Harold Harefoot]], until he died in 1040, after which another of Cnut's sons, [[Harthacnut (1020\u20131042)|Harthacnut]], took the throne. Since Harthacnut was already on the Danish throne, this reunited the North Sea Empire. Harthacnut lived only another two years, and from his death in 1042 until 1066 the monarchy reverted to the English line in the form of [[Edward the Confessor]].\n\nEdward died in January 1066 without an obvious successor, and an English nobleman, [[Harold II of England|Harold Godwinson]], took the throne. In the autumn of that same year, two rival claimants to the throne led invasions of England in short succession. First, [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] of Norway took York in September, but was defeated by Harold at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], in [[Yorkshire]]. Then, three weeks later, [[William I of England|William of Normandy]] defeated Harold at the [[Battle of Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], and in December he accepted the submission of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], last in the line of Anglo-Saxon royal succession, at [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe Danelaw appeared in legislation as late as the early 12th century with the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', where it is referred to as one of the laws together with those of Wessex and Mercia into which England was divided.\n\n==Danish\u2013Norwegian conflict in the North Sea==\nIn the 11th century, when King [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]] had freed Norway from Cnut the Great, the terms of the peace treaty provided that the first of the two kings Magnus (Norway) and Harthacnut (Denmark) to die would leave their dominion as an inheritance to the other. When Edward the Confessor ascended the throne of a united Dano-Saxon England, a Norse army was raised from every Norwegian colony in the British Isles and attacked Edward's England in support of Magnus', and after his death, his brother Harald Hardrada's, claim to the English throne. On the accession of [[Harold Godwinson]] after the death of Edward the Confessor, Hardrada invaded Northumbria with the support of Harold's brother [[Tostig Godwinson]], and was defeated at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], three weeks before William I's victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\n==Chronology==\n'''800''' \u2212 Waves of Danish assaults on the coastlines of the British Isles.\n\n'''865''' \u2212 Danish raiders first begin to settle in England. Led by the brothers Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they wintered in East Anglia, where they demanded and received tribute in exchange for a temporary peace. From there, they move north and attack Northumbria, which is in the midst of a civil war between the deposed king Osberht and a usurper \u00c6lla. The Danes use the civil turmoil as an opportunity to capture York, which they sack and burn.\n\n'''867''' \u2212 Following the loss of York, Osberht and \u00c6lla form an alliance against the Danes. They launch a counter-attack, but the Danes kill both Osberht and \u00c6lla and set up a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne. In response, King \u00c6thelred of Wessex, along with his brother Alfred, march against the Danes, who are positioned behind fortifications in Nottingham, but are unable to draw them into battle. In order to effect peace, King Burgred of Mercia cedes Nottingham to the Danes in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia undisturbed.\n\n'''868''' \u2212 Danes capture [[Nottingham]]\n\n'''869''' \u2212 Ivar the Boneless returns and demands tribute from King Edmund of East Anglia.\n\n'''870''' \u2212 King Edmund refuses Ivar's demand.  Ivar defeats and captures Edmund at Hoxne, adding East Anglia to the area controlled by the invading Danes. King \u00c6thelred and Alfred attack the Danes at Reading, but are repulsed with heavy losses. The Danes pursue them.\n\n'''871''' \u2212 On 7 January, \u00c6thelred and Alfred make their stand at Ashdown (on what is the Berkshire/North Wessex Downs now in Oxfordshire). \u00c6thelred could not be found at the start of battle, as he was busy praying in his tent, so Alfred leads the army into battle. \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeat the Danes, who count among their losses five [[earl|jarls]] (nobles). The Danes retreat and set up fortifications at [[Old Basing|Basing]] ([[Basingstoke]]) in Hampshire, a mere {{convert|14|mi|km}} from Reading. \u00c6thelred attacks the Danish fortifications and is routed. The Danes follow up with another victory in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).\n\nKing \u00c6thelred dies on 23 April 871 and Alfred takes the throne of Wessex. For the rest of the year Alfred concentrates on attacking with small bands against isolated groups of Danes. He is moderately successful in this endeavour and is able to score minor victories against the Danes, but his army is on the verge of collapse. Alfred responds by paying off the Danes in order for a promise of peace. During the peace, the Danes turn north and attack Mercia, which they finish off in short order, and capture London in the process. King Burgred of Mercia fights in vain against Ivar the Boneless and his Danish invaders for three years until 874, when he flees to Europe. During Ivar's campaign against Mercia he dies and is succeeded by Guthrum the Old. Guthrum quickly defeats Burgred and places a puppet on the throne of Mercia. The Danes now control East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, with only Wessex continuing to resist.\n\n'''875''' \u2212 The Danes settle in [[Dorset]], well inside of Alfred's Kingdom of Wessex, but Alfred quickly makes peace with them.\n\n'''876''' \u2212 The Danes break the peace when they capture the fortress of Wareham, followed by a similar capture of Exeter in 877.\n\n'''877''' \u2212 Alfred lays in a siege, while the Danes wait for reinforcements from Scandinavia. Unfortunately for the Danes, the fleet of reinforcements encounter a storm and lose more than 100 ships, and the Danes are forced to return to East Mercia in the north.\n\n'''878''' \u2212 In January, Guthrum leads an attack against Wessex that seeks to capture Alfred while he winters in Chippenham. Another Danish army [[Viking expansion#Wales|landed in south Wales]] arrives and moves south with the intent of intercepting Alfred should he flee from Guthrum's forces. However, they stop during their march to capture a small fortress at Countisbury Hill, held by a Wessex [[ealdorman]] named [[Odda, Ealdorman of Devon|Odda]]. The Saxons, led by Odda, attack the Danes while they sleep and defeat their superior forces, saving Alfred from being trapped between the two armies. Alfred is forced to go into hiding for the rest of the winter and spring of 878 in the Somerset marshes in order to avoid the superior Danish forces. In the spring, Alfred is able to gather an army and attacks Guthrum and the Danes at Edington. The Danes are defeated and retreat to Chippenham, where the English pursue and lay siege to Guthrum's forces. The Danes are unable to hold out without relief and soon surrender. Alfred demands as a term of the surrender that Guthrum become baptised as a Christian, which Guthrum agrees to do, with Alfred acting as his godfather. Guthrum is true to his word and settles in East Anglia, at least for a while.\n\n'''884''' \u2212 Guthrum attacks Kent, but is defeated by the English. This leads to the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, which establishes the boundaries of the Danelaw and allows for Danish self-rule in the region.<ref name=attenbborough96>{{Cite book|editor-last=Attenborough|editor-first=F.L.

These strongholds became known as the ''Five Boroughs''. ''Borough'' derives from the Old English word ''burh'' ([[cognate]] with German ''Burg'', meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several households, anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further.\n\n==Legal concepts==\nThe Danelaw was an important factor in the establishment of a civilian peace in the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon and Viking communities. It established, for example, equivalences in areas of legal contentiousness, such as the amount of reparation that should be payable in ''[[weregild|wergild]]''.\n\nMany of the legalistic concepts were compatible; for example, the Viking ''wapentake'', the standard for land division in the Danelaw, was effectively interchangeable with the [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]. The use of the execution site and cemetery at [[Walkington Wold Burials|Walkington Wold]] in east Yorkshire suggests a continuity of judicial practice.<ref>J.L. Buckberry & D.M. Hadley, \"An Anglo-Saxon Execution Cemetery at Walkington Wold, Yorkshire\", ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' 26(3) 2007, 325</ref>\n\nUnder the Danelaw, between 30% and 50% of the population in the countryside had the legal status of '[[sokeman]]', occupying an intermediate position between the [[free tenant]]s and the [[Villein (feudal)|bond tenants]].<ref>Emma Day (2011), [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/239350/Emma_Day_Thesis.pdf;sequence=1 SOKEMEN AND FREEMEN IN LATE ANGLO-SAXON EAST ANGLIA IN COMPARATIVE CONTEXT.

It concluded that Norse invaders settled sporadically throughout the British Isles with a particular concentration in certain areas, such as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1689955.stm |title=ENGLAND &#124; Viking blood still flowing |work=BBC News |date=2001-12-03 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> In this finding, the Vikings refers to Norwegian Vikings only, as the study did not set out to genetically distinguish descendants of Danish Vikings from descendants of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlers.

The same study could not detect Viking genes from the raiding period.\n\n==Archaeology==\nMajor archaeological sites that bear testimony to the Danelaw are few. The most famous is the site at York. Another Danelaw site is the cremation site at Heath Wood, [[Ingleby, Derbyshire|Ingleby]], [[Derbyshire]].\n\nArchaeological sites do not bear out the historically defined area as being a real demographic or trade boundary. This could be due to misallocation of the items and features on which this judgement is based as being indicative of either Anglo-Saxon or Norse presence. Otherwise, it could indicate that there was considerable population movement between the areas, or simply that after the treaty was made, it was ignored by one or both sides.\n\n[[Thynghowe]] was an important Danelaw meeting place, today located in [[Sherwood Forest]], in Nottinghamshire. The word \"howe\" often indicates a prehistoric [[burial mound]]. Howe is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''Haugr'' meaning mound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/ebooks/guide-to-scandinavian-origins-of-place-names.pdf |first=Anke-Beate |last=Stahl |title=Guide to Scandinavian origins of place names in Britain |work=[[Ordnance Survey]] |date=May 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> The site's rediscovery was made by Lynda Mallett, Stuart Reddish and John Wood.

From 1016 to 1035, [[Cnut the Great]] ruled over a unified English kingdom, itself the product of a resurgent Wessex, as part of his [[North Sea Empire]], together with Denmark, Norway and part of Sweden. Cnut was succeeded in England on his death by his son [[Harold Harefoot]], until he died in 1040, after which another of Cnut's sons, [[Harthacnut (1020\u20131042)|Harthacnut]], took the throne. Since Harthacnut was already on the Danish throne, this reunited the North Sea Empire. Harthacnut lived only another two years, and from his death in 1042 until 1066 the monarchy reverted to the English line in the form of [[Edward the Confessor]].\n\nEdward died in January 1066 without an obvious successor, and an English nobleman, [[Harold II of England|Harold Godwinson]], took the throne. In the autumn of that same year, two rival claimants to the throne led invasions of England in short succession. First, [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] of Norway took York in September, but was defeated by Harold at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], in [[Yorkshire]]. Then, three weeks later, [[William I of England|William of Normandy]] defeated Harold at the [[Battle of Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], and in December he accepted the submission of [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], last in the line of Anglo-Saxon royal succession, at [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe Danelaw appeared in legislation as late as the early 12th century with the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', where it is referred to as one of the laws together with those of Wessex and Mercia into which England was divided.\n\n==Danish\u2013Norwegian conflict in the North Sea==\nIn the 11th century, when King [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]] had freed Norway from Cnut the Great, the terms of the peace treaty provided that the first of the two kings Magnus (Norway) and Harthacnut (Denmark) to die would leave their dominion as an inheritance to the other. When Edward the Confessor ascended the throne of a united Dano-Saxon England, a Norse army was raised from every Norwegian colony in the British Isles and attacked Edward's England in support of Magnus', and after his death, his brother Harald Hardrada's, claim to the English throne. On the accession of [[Harold Godwinson]] after the death of Edward the Confessor, Hardrada invaded Northumbria with the support of Harold's brother [[Tostig Godwinson]], and was defeated at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], three weeks before William I's victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\n==Chronology==\n'''800''' \u2212 Waves of Danish assaults on the coastlines of the British Isles.\n\n'''865''' \u2212 Danish raiders first begin to settle in England. Led by the brothers Halfdan and Ivar the Boneless, they wintered in East Anglia, where they demanded and received tribute in exchange for a temporary peace. From there, they move north and attack Northumbria, which is in the midst of a civil war between the deposed king Osberht and a usurper \u00c6lla. The Danes use the civil turmoil as an opportunity to capture York, which they sack and burn.\n\n'''867''' \u2212 Following the loss of York, Osberht and \u00c6lla form an alliance against the Danes. They launch a counter-attack, but the Danes kill both Osberht and \u00c6lla and set up a puppet king on the Northumbrian throne. In response, King \u00c6thelred of Wessex, along with his brother Alfred, march against the Danes, who are positioned behind fortifications in Nottingham, but are unable to draw them into battle. In order to effect peace, King Burgred of Mercia cedes Nottingham to the Danes in exchange for leaving the rest of Mercia undisturbed.\n\n'''868''' \u2212 Danes capture [[Nottingham]]\n\n'''869''' \u2212 Ivar the Boneless returns and demands tribute from King Edmund of East Anglia.\n\n'''870''' \u2212 King Edmund refuses Ivar's demand.  Ivar defeats and captures Edmund at Hoxne, adding East Anglia to the area controlled by the invading Danes. King \u00c6thelred and Alfred attack the Danes at Reading, but are repulsed with heavy losses. The Danes pursue them.\n\n'''871''' \u2212 On 7 January, \u00c6thelred and Alfred make their stand at Ashdown (on what is the Berkshire/North Wessex Downs now in Oxfordshire). \u00c6thelred could not be found at the start of battle, as he was busy praying in his tent, so Alfred leads the army into battle. \u00c6thelred and Alfred defeat the Danes, who count among their losses five [[earl|jarls]] (nobles). The Danes retreat and set up fortifications at [[Old Basing|Basing]] ([[Basingstoke]]) in Hampshire, a mere {{convert|14|mi|km}} from Reading. \u00c6thelred attacks the Danish fortifications and is routed. The Danes follow up with another victory in March at Meretum (now Marton, Wiltshire).\n\nKing \u00c6thelred dies on 23 April 871 and Alfred takes the throne of Wessex. For the rest of the year Alfred concentrates on attacking with small bands against isolated groups of Danes. He is moderately successful in this endeavour and is able to score minor victories against the Danes, but his army is on the verge of collapse. Alfred responds by paying off the Danes in order for a promise of peace. During the peace, the Danes turn north and attack Mercia, which they finish off in short order, and capture London in the process. King Burgred of Mercia fights in vain against Ivar the Boneless and his Danish invaders for three years until 874, when he flees to Europe. During Ivar's campaign against Mercia he dies and is succeeded by Guthrum the Old. Guthrum quickly defeats Burgred and places a puppet on the throne of Mercia. The Danes now control East Anglia, Northumbria and Mercia, with only Wessex continuing to resist.\n\n'''875''' \u2212 The Danes settle in [[Dorset]], well inside of Alfred's Kingdom of Wessex, but Alfred quickly makes peace with them.\n\n'''876''' \u2212 The Danes break the peace when they capture the fortress of Wareham, followed by a similar capture of Exeter in 877.\n\n'''877''' \u2212 Alfred lays in a siege, while the Danes wait for reinforcements from Scandinavia. Unfortunately for the Danes, the fleet of reinforcements encounter a storm and lose more than 100 ships, and the Danes are forced to return to East Mercia in the north.\n\n'''878''' \u2212 In January, Guthrum leads an attack against Wessex that seeks to capture Alfred while he winters in Chippenham. Another Danish army [[Viking expansion#Wales|landed in south Wales]] arrives and moves south with the intent of intercepting Alfred should he flee from Guthrum's forces. However, they stop during their march to capture a small fortress at Countisbury Hill, held by a Wessex [[ealdorman]] named [[Odda, Ealdorman of Devon|Odda]]. The Saxons, led by Odda, attack the Danes while they sleep and defeat their superior forces, saving Alfred from being trapped between the two armies. Alfred is forced to go into hiding for the rest of the winter and spring of 878 in the Somerset marshes in order to avoid the superior Danish forces. In the spring, Alfred is able to gather an army and attacks Guthrum and the Danes at Edington. The Danes are defeated and retreat to Chippenham, where the English pursue and lay siege to Guthrum's forces. The Danes are unable to hold out without relief and soon surrender. Alfred demands as a term of the surrender that Guthrum become baptised as a Christian, which Guthrum agrees to do, with Alfred acting as his godfather. Guthrum is true to his word and settles in East Anglia, at least for a while.\n\n'''884''' \u2212 Guthrum attacks Kent, but is defeated by the English. This leads to the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, which establishes the boundaries of the Danelaw and allows for Danish self-rule in the region.<ref name=attenbborough96>{{Cite book|editor-last=Attenborough|editor-first=F.L.

These strongholds became known as the ''Five Boroughs''. ''Borough'' derives from the Old English word ''burh'' ([[cognate]] with German ''Burg'', meaning castle), meaning a fortified and walled enclosure containing several households, anything from a large stockade to a fortified town. The meaning has since developed further.\n\n==Legal concepts==\nThe Danelaw was an important factor in the establishment of a civilian peace in the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon and Viking communities. It established, for example, equivalences in areas of legal contentiousness, such as the amount of reparation that should be payable in ''[[weregild|wergild]]''.\n\nMany of the legalistic concepts were compatible; for example, the Viking ''wapentake'', the standard for land division in the Danelaw, was effectively interchangeable with the [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]].

It concluded that Norse invaders settled sporadically throughout the British Isles with a particular concentration in certain areas, such as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1689955.stm |title=ENGLAND &#124; Viking blood still flowing |work=BBC News |date=2001-12-03 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> In this finding, the Vikings refers to Norwegian Vikings only, as the study did not set out to genetically distinguish descendants of Danish Vikings from descendants of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] settlers. That was decided on the basis that the latter two groups originated from areas that overlap each other on the continental North Sea coast (ranging from the [[Jutland Peninsula]] to [[Belgium]]) and were therefore deemed inconvenient or difficult to genetically distinguish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geneticarchaeology.com/research/Blood_Of_The_Vikings.asp |title=Blood of the Vikings |work=Genetic Archaeology |year=2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606235749/http://www.geneticarchaeology.com/research/Blood_Of_The_Vikings.asp |archive-date=2014-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A further genetic study in 2015 found some evidence that, after Germanic migrants began settling (400s CE), their communities had lived alongside indigenous 'British' ones, and not intermingled for the first hundred years before going on to become a homogenous genetic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31905764|title=DNA study: Celts not a single group|first=Pallab|last=Ghosh|date=18 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> This may therefore have been a similar process during the Scandinavian settlement of the Danelaw. The same study could not detect Viking genes from the raiding period.\n\n==Archaeology==\nMajor archaeological sites that bear testimony to the Danelaw are few. The most famous is the site at York. Another Danelaw site is the cremation site at Heath Wood, [[Ingleby, Derbyshire|Ingleby]], [[Derbyshire]].\n\nArchaeological sites do not bear out the historically defined area as being a real demographic or trade boundary. This could be due to misallocation of the items and features on which this judgement is based as being indicative of either Anglo-Saxon or Norse presence. Otherwise, it could indicate that there was considerable population movement between the areas, or simply that after the treaty was made, it was ignored by one or both sides.\n\n[[Thynghowe]] was an important Danelaw meeting place, today located in [[Sherwood Forest]], in Nottinghamshire. The word \"howe\" often indicates a prehistoric [[burial mound]]. Howe is derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''Haugr'' meaning mound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/ebooks/guide-to-scandinavian-origins-of-place-names.pdf |first=Anke-Beate |last=Stahl |title=Guide to Scandinavian origins of place names in Britain |work=[[Ordnance Survey]] |date=May 2004 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref> The site's rediscovery was made by Lynda Mallett, Stuart Reddish and John Wood. The site had vanished from modern maps and was essentially lost to history until the local history enthusiasts made their discoveries. Experts think the rediscovered site, which lies amidst the old oaks of an area known as the [[Birklands]] in Sherwood Forest, may also yield clues as to the boundary of the ancient [[Anglo Saxon]] kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria.

It is {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} north-east of [[Charing Cross]]. Dalston began as a hamlet on either side of Dalston Lane, and as the area urbanised the term also came to apply to surrounding areas including [[Kingsland, London|Kingsland]] and [[Shacklewell]], all three of which being part of the [[Civil Parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n \nGentrification has led to a rapid increase in the price of property, with current prices 8% above the London average.  The process of change was accelerated by the [[East London line extension]], now part of [[London Overground]], and the reopening of [[Dalston Junction railway station]], part of London's successful bid to host the [[2012 Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/20185.aspx|accessdate=4 January 2013|website=Tfl.gov.uk|title=London Overground's East London route doubles passenger numbers in one year|date=7 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Bounds==\nDalston has never been an administrative unit, and partly for this reason the boundaries are not fully defined. There are popularly understood boundaries in the south and west, but its northern and especially eastern extent is not delineated. This is a common situation in London's neighbourhoods which often merge, overlap and change over time.\nThere is an electoral Ward of the same name which covers a part of the north\u2013west of Dalston.\n\nDalston's boundaries are described with more or less precision below: \n* '''South:''' Dalston takes [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney's]] southern border with [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]]. Albion Drive forms much of this boundary.\n* '''West:''' The originally Roman A10 road (under the names, south to north: [[Kingsland Road]], Kingsland High St, Stoke Newington Road) marks most of Dalston's western margin. The exception is that both sides of Kingsland High St. are included - here Dalston takes Hackney's western boundary as it crosses the A10 to take in a small area bounded by Boleyn Road and the Crossway. This area includes [[Dalston Kingsland Railway Station]]. The western boundary closely corresponds with the western side of the E8 postal area with which Dalston is strongly associated \u2013 though the postal area also takes in parts of [[Hackney Central|central Hackney]] and [[Haggerston]] that are not ever described as belonging to Dalston.\n* '''North:''' There is not a tradition of a clear northern boundary with [[West Hackney]]. Dalston's close association with the E8 postal area means that its \u2018sphere of self-identification' does not extend far, if at all, beyond the postcode boundary, and no further north than Farleigh Road.\n* '''East:''' Between Downs Road and Amhurst Road, the physical barrier of the railway embankment marks the postcode boundary with [[Lower Clapton]]. There is little tradition of a boundary with the [[Hackney Central|central Hackney]] area except that it is sometimes said that Dalston extends as far as the park at [[London Fields]].\n\n==History==\nThe name Dalston is thought to have derived from ''Deorlaf's tun'' (farm)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/ES_Vol_I_Main_Report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dalston Junction Environmental Report|website=Origin.tfl.gov.uk|accessdate=30 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823201420/http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/ES_Vol_I_Main_Report.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> in much the same way as nearby Hoxton was named after the farm of \"Hoch\". The first written record available is from 1294 when the name was written as Derleston.\n\nThe village was one of four small villages within the [[Hackney (parish)|Parish of Hackney]] (along with [[West Hackney|Newington]], [[Shacklewell]], and [[Kingsland, London|Kingsland]]) that were grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the [[Hackney Central|village of Hackney]].\n\n[[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746#The Country Near Ten Miles Round|John Rocque's map of 1746]] shows the village of Kingsland centred on the crossroads at what is now Dalston Junction and the small village of Dalston further east along Dalston Lane. Another clear feature is Roman [[Ermine Street]] which now forms most of the western boundary of this area. Ermine Street now has the road number A10 and goes by a number of names, including [[Kingsland Road]] as it travels through London.\n\nAround AD 1280 a [[leper hospital]] was founded in Dalston by the citizens of London and in AD 1549 it was attached to the chapel of St Bartholomew as an outhouse.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries the area changed from an agricultural and rural landscape to an urban one.  By 1849, it was described as ''a recently increased suburban village, with some handsome old houses'', and by 1859 the village had exceeded its neighbour and, with the railways and continuous building, the village of Kingsland disappeared.<ref name=Brit>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22698|title=Hackney: Dalston and Kingsland Road - British History Online|website=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1930s, 1940s<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1585110/Vidal-Sassoon-Anti-fascist-warrior-hairdresser.html|title=Vidal Sassoon: Anti-fascist warrior-hairdresser|last=Singh  |first=Anita, showbusiness editor|date=2008-04-13|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pasttenseblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/today-in-londons-radical-history-fascist-rally-in-ridley-road-market-smashed-by-jewish-43-group-1947/|title=Today in London\u2019s radical history: fascist rally in Ridley Road market, smashed by Jewish 43 Group, 1947|date=2016-06-01|work=past tense|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/last-reunion-for-war-heroes-who-came-home-to-fight-the-fascists-1628953.html|title=Last reunion for war heroes who came home to fight the fascists|date=2009-02-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> and 1960s<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/31/newsid_2776000/2776295.stm|title=1962: Violence flares at Mosley rally|website=News.bbc.co.uk|date=1962-07-31|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mosley-tries-again|title=Mosley Tries Again|author=British Path\u00e9|website=Britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mosley-gets-rough-house|title=Mosley Gets Rough House|author=British Path\u00e9|website=Britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref> the area's large Jewish and other minority populations made it a target for provocative rallies by [[Oswald Mosley]] and the various organisations he founded. These were actively opposed by many local people, together with organisations such as the [[43 Group]] and this led to a number of violent confrontations, notably in the Ridley Road area.\n\nIn July 2017 a violent riot broke out on Dalston Road, which had originally started as a demonstration against police violence. Protesters barricaded the spot where a man, who later died at the [[Royal London Hospital]], had been arrested.

The hospital was initially founded to cater primarily for London's then large German-speaking community. It eventually became an ordinary [[National Health Service|NHS]] facility before its facilities were merged and moved to [[Homerton University Hospital]].\n\n==Festivals==\nDalston is known for music, events and its nightlife. Its biggest festival to date began in 2015, Dalston Music Festival. Centred on Gillett Square and 8 clubs in the surrounding area, it was founded by Andrew Bunsell of Dalston Studios.\n\n==Arts and entertainment==\n[[File:dalston culture house.jpg|thumb|right|The Dalston Culture House now houses the Vortex Jazz Club. (October 2005)]]\n\nDalston hosts several art and entertainment venues, and has a history as an entertainment centre, with at one time hosting four or five cinemas within a radius of a \u2153 of a mile, and the Dalston Theatre, a former [[hippodrome]] and [[music hall]] that later became the [[The Four Aces Club|Four Aces blues club and the Labyrinth nightclub]]. The Dalston Theatre was demolished in February 2007, despite an active local campaign to save it.

A major traffic nexus. (October 2005)]]\nContemporary Dalston is a lively neighbourhood with an ethnically varied population. Architecturally it is a mixture of 18th- and 19th-century [[terraced house]]s and 20th-century [[council estate]]s. It is currently undergoing rapid [[gentrification]], partly because of the redevelopment of the railway station at [[Dalston Junction railway station|Dalston Junction]] and partly due to the revitalisation of large parts of east London in the build-up to the [[2012 Olympics]]. ([[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] was one of the four host [[borough]]s of the [[2012 Olympics|Games]].)\n\nDalston has attracted immigrants for over 100 years; at the turn of the century it was a popular area for newly arrived [[Jews|Jewish]] people from [[central Europe]]. In the 1950s and '60s, as the Jewish community became more affluent and moved out, they were replaced by a large Caribbean community, which accounts for the wide choice of Caribbean food available in Ridley Road. As the Caribbean community slowly drifted out of Dalston it then became popular with the Turkish, as well as the Vietnamese. Recent arrivals include Poles, judging by the numbers of Polish delicatessens now appearing and other stores catering to Polish tastes.\n\n[[Fassett Square]] was the inspiration for the BBC soap ''[[EastEnders]]''. Originally, there were plans to film the series there, on location. However, Fassett Square ([[Albert Square]]) and Ridley Road Market (Walford Market) were rebuilt on the set in Elstree, near Borehamwood, to have a more controlled filming environment. The idea of Walford stems from Walford Road, and many of the houses on the show use the same exterior design. Coincidentally both [[Barbara Windsor]] and [[Tony Holland]], one of the original creators of the show, lived at different times on the street.\n\nThe Hackney Peace Carnival Mural created in 1985, depicts a group of people marching for peace against \"the bomb\" and has become an important cultural statement from that era. It can be found opposite Dalston Junction Overground station on Dalston Lane. It has also been used on the cover of an album by local group Rudimental.\n\n[[Music hall]] artist [[Marie Lloyd]] (1870\u20131922) used to reside on Graham Road.

It is {{convert|4|mi|km|1}} north-east of [[Charing Cross]]. Dalston began as a hamlet on either side of Dalston Lane, and as the area urbanised the term also came to apply to surrounding areas including [[Kingsland, London|Kingsland]] and [[Shacklewell]], all three of which being part of the [[Civil Parish#Ancient Parishes|Ancient Parish]] of [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n \nGentrification has led to a rapid increase in the price of property, with current prices 8% above the London average.

There are popularly understood boundaries in the south and west, but its northern and especially eastern extent is not delineated. This is a common situation in London's neighbourhoods which often merge, overlap and change over time.\nThere is an electoral Ward of the same name which covers a part of the north\u2013west of Dalston.\n\nDalston's boundaries are described with more or less precision below: \n* '''South:''' Dalston takes [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney's]] southern border with [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch|Shoreditch]]. Albion Drive forms much of this boundary.\n* '''West:''' The originally Roman A10 road (under the names, south to north: [[Kingsland Road]], Kingsland High St, Stoke Newington Road) marks most of Dalston's western margin. The exception is that both sides of Kingsland High St. are included - here Dalston takes Hackney's western boundary as it crosses the A10 to take in a small area bounded by Boleyn Road and the Crossway. This area includes [[Dalston Kingsland Railway Station]]. The western boundary closely corresponds with the western side of the E8 postal area with which Dalston is strongly associated \u2013 though the postal area also takes in parts of [[Hackney Central|central Hackney]] and [[Haggerston]] that are not ever described as belonging to Dalston.\n* '''North:''' There is not a tradition of a clear northern boundary with [[West Hackney]]. Dalston's close association with the E8 postal area means that its \u2018sphere of self-identification' does not extend far, if at all, beyond the postcode boundary, and no further north than Farleigh Road.\n* '''East:''' Between Downs Road and Amhurst Road, the physical barrier of the railway embankment marks the postcode boundary with [[Lower Clapton]]. There is little tradition of a boundary with the [[Hackney Central|central Hackney]] area except that it is sometimes said that Dalston extends as far as the park at [[London Fields]].\n\n==History==\nThe name Dalston is thought to have derived from ''Deorlaf's tun'' (farm)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/ES_Vol_I_Main_Report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dalston Junction Environmental Report|website=Origin.tfl.gov.uk|accessdate=30 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823201420/http://origin.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/ES_Vol_I_Main_Report.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> in much the same way as nearby Hoxton was named after the farm of \"Hoch\". The first written record available is from 1294 when the name was written as Derleston.\n\nThe village was one of four small villages within the [[Hackney (parish)|Parish of Hackney]] (along with [[West Hackney|Newington]], [[Shacklewell]], and [[Kingsland, London|Kingsland]]) that were grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the [[Hackney Central|village of Hackney]].\n\n[[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746#The Country Near Ten Miles Round|John Rocque's map of 1746]] shows the village of Kingsland centred on the crossroads at what is now Dalston Junction and the small village of Dalston further east along Dalston Lane. Another clear feature is Roman [[Ermine Street]] which now forms most of the western boundary of this area. Ermine Street now has the road number A10 and goes by a number of names, including [[Kingsland Road]] as it travels through London.\n\nAround AD 1280 a [[leper hospital]] was founded in Dalston by the citizens of London and in AD 1549 it was attached to the chapel of St Bartholomew as an outhouse.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries the area changed from an agricultural and rural landscape to an urban one.  By 1849, it was described as ''a recently increased suburban village, with some handsome old houses'', and by 1859 the village had exceeded its neighbour and, with the railways and continuous building, the village of Kingsland disappeared.<ref name=Brit>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22698|title=Hackney: Dalston and Kingsland Road - British History Online|website=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=8 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1930s, 1940s<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1585110/Vidal-Sassoon-Anti-fascist-warrior-hairdresser.html|title=Vidal Sassoon: Anti-fascist warrior-hairdresser|last=Singh  |first=Anita, showbusiness editor|date=2008-04-13|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pasttenseblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/today-in-londons-radical-history-fascist-rally-in-ridley-road-market-smashed-by-jewish-43-group-1947/|title=Today in London\u2019s radical history: fascist rally in Ridley Road market, smashed by Jewish 43 Group, 1947|date=2016-06-01|work=past tense|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/last-reunion-for-war-heroes-who-came-home-to-fight-the-fascists-1628953.html|title=Last reunion for war heroes who came home to fight the fascists|date=2009-02-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> and 1960s<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/31/newsid_2776000/2776295.stm|title=1962: Violence flares at Mosley rally|website=News.bbc.co.uk|date=1962-07-31|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mosley-tries-again|title=Mosley Tries Again|author=British Path\u00e9|website=Britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mosley-gets-rough-house|title=Mosley Gets Rough House|author=British Path\u00e9|website=Britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref> the area's large Jewish and other minority populations made it a target for provocative rallies by [[Oswald Mosley]] and the various organisations he founded.

It eventually became an ordinary [[National Health Service|NHS]] facility before its facilities were merged and moved to [[Homerton University Hospital]].\n\n==Festivals==\nDalston is known for music, events and its nightlife. Its biggest festival to date began in 2015, Dalston Music Festival. Centred on Gillett Square and 8 clubs in the surrounding area, it was founded by Andrew Bunsell of Dalston Studios.\n\n==Arts and entertainment==\n[[File:dalston culture house.jpg|thumb|right|The Dalston Culture House now houses the Vortex Jazz Club.

A major traffic nexus. (October 2005)]]\nContemporary Dalston is a lively neighbourhood with an ethnically varied population. Architecturally it is a mixture of 18th- and 19th-century [[terraced house]]s and 20th-century [[council estate]]s. It is currently undergoing rapid [[gentrification]], partly because of the redevelopment of the railway station at [[Dalston Junction railway station|Dalston Junction]] and partly due to the revitalisation of large parts of east London in the build-up to the [[2012 Olympics]]. ([[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] was one of the four host [[borough]]s of the [[2012 Olympics|Games]].)\n\nDalston has attracted immigrants for over 100 years; at the turn of the century it was a popular area for newly arrived [[Jews|Jewish]] people from [[central Europe]]. In the 1950s and '60s, as the Jewish community became more affluent and moved out, they were replaced by a large Caribbean community, which accounts for the wide choice of Caribbean food available in Ridley Road. As the Caribbean community slowly drifted out of Dalston it then became popular with the Turkish, as well as the Vietnamese. Recent arrivals include Poles, judging by the numbers of Polish delicatessens now appearing and other stores catering to Polish tastes.\n\n[[Fassett Square]] was the inspiration for the BBC soap ''[[EastEnders]]''. Originally, there were plans to film the series there, on location. However, Fassett Square ([[Albert Square]]) and Ridley Road Market (Walford Market) were rebuilt on the set in Elstree, near Borehamwood, to have a more controlled filming environment. The idea of Walford stems from Walford Road, and many of the houses on the show use the same exterior design. Coincidentally both [[Barbara Windsor]] and [[Tony Holland]], one of the original creators of the show, lived at different times on the street.\n\nThe Hackney Peace Carnival Mural created in 1985, depicts a group of people marching for peace against \"the bomb\" and has become an important cultural statement from that era. It can be found opposite Dalston Junction Overground station on Dalston Lane. It has also been used on the cover of an album by local group Rudimental.\n\n[[Music hall]] artist [[Marie Lloyd]] (1870\u20131922) used to reside on Graham Road. The house now has a [[blue plaque]].\n\nIn April 2009 ''The Guardian'' published an article on Dalston claiming that it was the \"coolest\" place to live in Britain.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/27/dalston-cool-london-suburb | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Flynn | title=Welcome to Dalston, now the coolest place in Britain | date=27 April 2009}}</ref> In the same year however, sculpture park [[The Towers of Hackney]] was torn down to give way to new buildings.\n\n==Transport==\n\n=== Rail ===\nDalston is on the [[London Overground]] network, served by three stations:\n\n* [[File:Dalston Junction stn concourse.JPG|alt=Dalston Junction station concourse, which is clad in reflective, silver metal.

The name almost certainly originated with a small farmstead, the \"ham\" or farm of a man called Daecca, as ''D\u00e6ccan hamm'' in [[Old English]] means ''home of a man called D\u00e6cca''.<ref name=mills29>{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=64}}</ref> The charter was made to reflect a transfer of land from Aethelred, kinsman of [[Saebbi of Essex|King Saebbi of Essex]], to Barking Abbey.<ref>On the context of the charter https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref>\n\n===Manor of Barking===\nDagenham has been historically defined by its [[Civil Parish#Ancient parishes|Ancient Parish]] boundaries, which were subsequently re-used by the [[Municipal Borough of Dagenham]] up until 1965. The parish of Dagenham was formed in the medieval period to serve - along with parish of [[Barking, London|Barking]] (which included [[Ilford|Great Ilford]] until the 19th century)<ref>on the history of the Manor of Barking https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref> - the people of the huge manor of Barking, which was owned by the Nunnery of [[Barking Abbey]]. This reversed the usual situation where a parish would serve one or more manors.\nAs with other manors, the area held by the declined over time, but the parish boundaries based on its former extent remained constant. Barking Abbey was dissolved in 1539.\n\n===Pre-urban landscape===\nLike most Essex [[River Thames|Thames-side]] parishes, Dagenham was laid out on a N-S axis to give it a share of the marshes by the river, the agricultural land in the centre and the woods and commons on the poorer soils on the high ground in the north. Dagenham included a significant part of the now mostly lost [[Hainault Forest]].\n\n===Dagenham Breach===\nDagenham was protected from the Thames by defences built in the 17th century by Dutch engineers. In 1704 an exceptionally high tide swept away fourteen feet of embankment and flooded nearly 5,000 acres of land. The breach widened over time to a width of 400 feet, allowing the Thames to strip  the top layer of marsh clay from the flood plain and deposited it as a mud bank in the Thames where it became a danger to shipping.\n\nThe gap in the wall was replaced by 1714 in a celebrated act of civil engineering. The closure of the gap left behind a large lake, known as Dagenham Breach, which became a popular spot for anglers. The lake is still there, but much has silted up or been filled in, and it is now surrounded by industry.<ref>http://www.barkinghistory.co.uk/dagenham-breach.html</ref>\n\n===Whitebait Dinners===\nDagenham was formerly home to the famous annual whitebait feast. The custom appears to have been started by the King's Commissioner of Works to celebrate the closure of the breach in the seawall around 1714\u201320, and was held every subsequent spring, on or around [[Trinity Sunday]].\n\nMany years later, [[Sir Robert Preston, 6th Baronet|Sir Robert Preston MP]], invited his friend [[George Rose (politician)|George Rose]] the Secretary of the Treasury and others to celebrate the feast, and on another occasion Rose invited the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Thereafter it became an obligatory ritual of government for the entire cabinet to come to Dagenham and celebrate the security of the Thames and over time this simple but hearty meal based on Whitebait and local Essex Ale grew more lavish, including turtle, grouse, champagne and a range of other luxury food and drink.

A 500-acre (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) riverside site was developed to become Europe's largest car plant, a vast [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] site with its own [[blast furnace]]s and power station, importing iron ore and exporting finished vehicles. By the 1950s Ford had taken over Briggs at Dagenham and its other sites at [[Doncaster]], [[Southampton]], [[Croydon]] and [[Romford]]. At its peak the Dagenham plant had {{convert|4000000|ft2}} of floor space and employed over 40,000 people, although this number gradually fell during the final three decades of the 20th century as production methods advanced and Ford invested in other European factories as well.<ref>Ford UK \u2013 [http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- History of Ford in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217091509/http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- |date=17 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 February 2002, full production was discontinued due to overcapacity in Europe and the relative difficulty of upgrading the 60-year-old site compared with other European sites such as [[Almussafes]] ([[Valencia (province)|Valencia]], [[Spain]]) and [[Cologne]]. Other factors leading to the closure of the Auto-assembly line were the need of the site for the new Diesel Centre of Excellence, which produces half of Ford's Diesel Engines worldwide, and the UK employment laws when compared to Spanish, German and Belgian laws. In 2005 Cummins went into a joint venture and offered $15 million (US) to reinstate the factory. Ford and Cummins offered a good redundancy package, billed as one of the best in UK manufacturing.

The [[Becontree]] estate is largely in the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, which also  also included [[Becontree Heath]], part of [[Rush Green, London|Rush Green]], Old Dagenham village, and the southern section around [[Dagenham Dock]] and adjacent to the [[River Thames]]. This southern section, which includes [[Ford Dagenham]], is part of the [[London Riverside]] section of the [[Thames Gateway]] redevelopment zone. The Dagenham [[post town]] includes the whole of the Becontree estate, including those sections that were in the former (pre 1965) boroughs of Barking and Ilford. Parts of the former borough of Dagenham - part of Chadwell Heath, part of Collier Row and part of Rush Green - are in the Romford Post town.\n\n(Dagenham is the name of a post town, and of a pre-1965 borough (and parish before that) with very different boundaries to the post town. Perhaps because of the name 'London Borough of Barking & Dagenham', adopted on 1 January 1980 to replace 'London Borough of Barking', there is an apparent popular - but incorrect - assumption that everywhere in that borough is either in Barking or in Dagenham. From 1965 it was true to say that everywhere in the then new London Borough was in one of the two former boroughs, but in the mid 1990s substantial areas of the London Borough of Redbridge were transferred to the borough, such that the entire Becontree and Padnall Estates were in LB Barking and Dagenham. Furthermore, parts of three post towns - Barking, Dagenham and Romford - cover the borough. The parliamentary constituency of Dagenham, formed in 1945, ceased to exist from the 2010 General Election, the six easternmost wards of LB Barking & Dagenham having become part of the Dagenham & Rainham Constituency,  with three wards in LB Havering, leaving most LB Barking & Dagenham wards in the enlarged Barking constituency.)\n\n==Demography==\nDagenham is a working class area.

The name almost certainly originated with a small farmstead, the \"ham\" or farm of a man called Daecca, as ''D\u00e6ccan hamm'' in [[Old English]] means ''home of a man called D\u00e6cca''.<ref name=mills29>{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=64}}</ref> The charter was made to reflect a transfer of land from Aethelred, kinsman of [[Saebbi of Essex|King Saebbi of Essex]], to Barking Abbey.<ref>On the context of the charter https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref>\n\n===Manor of Barking===\nDagenham has been historically defined by its [[Civil Parish#Ancient parishes|Ancient Parish]] boundaries, which were subsequently re-used by the [[Municipal Borough of Dagenham]] up until 1965. The parish of Dagenham was formed in the medieval period to serve - along with parish of [[Barking, London|Barking]] (which included [[Ilford|Great Ilford]] until the 19th century)<ref>on the history of the Manor of Barking https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol5/pp190-214</ref> - the people of the huge manor of Barking, which was owned by the Nunnery of [[Barking Abbey]]. This reversed the usual situation where a parish would serve one or more manors.\nAs with other manors, the area held by the declined over time, but the parish boundaries based on its former extent remained constant. Barking Abbey was dissolved in 1539.\n\n===Pre-urban landscape===\nLike most Essex [[River Thames|Thames-side]] parishes, Dagenham was laid out on a N-S axis to give it a share of the marshes by the river, the agricultural land in the centre and the woods and commons on the poorer soils on the high ground in the north. Dagenham included a significant part of the now mostly lost [[Hainault Forest]].\n\n===Dagenham Breach===\nDagenham was protected from the Thames by defences built in the 17th century by Dutch engineers. In 1704 an exceptionally high tide swept away fourteen feet of embankment and flooded nearly 5,000 acres of land. The breach widened over time to a width of 400 feet, allowing the Thames to strip  the top layer of marsh clay from the flood plain and deposited it as a mud bank in the Thames where it became a danger to shipping.\n\nThe gap in the wall was replaced by 1714 in a celebrated act of civil engineering. The closure of the gap left behind a large lake, known as Dagenham Breach, which became a popular spot for anglers. The lake is still there, but much has silted up or been filled in, and it is now surrounded by industry.<ref>http://www.barkinghistory.co.uk/dagenham-breach.html</ref>\n\n===Whitebait Dinners===\nDagenham was formerly home to the famous annual whitebait feast. The custom appears to have been started by the King's Commissioner of Works to celebrate the closure of the breach in the seawall around 1714-20, and was held every subsequent spring, on or around [[Trinity Sunday]].\n\nMany years later, [[Sir Robert Preston, 6th Baronet|Sir Robert Preston MP]], invited his friend [[George Rose (politician)|George Rose]] the Secretary of the Treasury and others to celebrate the feast, and on another occasion Rose invited the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]]. Thereafter it became an obligatory ritual of government for the entire cabinet to come to Dagenham and celebrate the security of the Thames and over time this simple but hearty meal based on Whitebait and local Essex Ale grew more lavish, including turtle, grouse, champagne and a range of other luxury food and drink. Eventually the cabinet tired of the long trip to Dagenham and moved the event to [[Greenwich]].<ref>Simon Schama \u2013 Landscape and Memory p352-354</ref>\n\n===Economic development===\n[[File:Ford Dagenham.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ford Dagenham|Ford Dagenham Terminal]]]]\nIn 1931 the [[Ford of Britain|Ford Motor Company]] relocated from [[Trafford Park]] in Manchester, to a [[Ford Dagenham|plant in Dagenham]], which was already the location of supplier Briggs Motorway Bodies. A 500-acre (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) riverside site was developed to become Europe's largest car plant, a vast [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] site with its own [[blast furnace]]s and power station, importing iron ore and exporting finished vehicles. By the 1950s Ford had taken over Briggs at Dagenham and its other sites at [[Doncaster]], [[Southampton]], [[Croydon]] and [[Romford]]. At its peak the Dagenham plant had {{convert|4000000|ft2}} of floor space and employed over 40,000 people, although this number gradually fell during the final three decades of the 20th century as production methods advanced and Ford invested in other European factories as well.<ref>Ford UK \u2013 [http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- History of Ford in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217091509/http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/htg_fib/-/htg_fib_WW21970/-/-/-/- |date=17 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 February 2002, full production was discontinued due to overcapacity in Europe and the relative difficulty of upgrading the 60-year-old site compared with other European sites such as [[Almussafes]] ([[Valencia (province)|Valencia]], [[Spain]]) and [[Cologne]]. Other factors leading to the closure of the Auto-assembly line were the need of the site for the new Diesel Centre of Excellence, which produces half of Ford's Diesel Engines worldwide, and the UK employment laws when compared to Spanish, German and Belgian laws. In 2005 Cummins went into a joint venture and offered $15 million (US) to reinstate the factory. Ford and Cummins offered a good redundancy package, billed as one of the best in UK manufacturing.

The [[Becontree]] estate is largely in the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, which also  also included [[Becontree Heath]], part of [[Rush Green, London|Rush Green]], Old Dagenham village, and the southern section around [[Dagenham Dock]] and adjacent to the [[River Thames]]. This southern section, which includes [[Ford Dagenham]], is part of the [[London Riverside]] section of the [[Thames Gateway]] redevelopment zone. The Dagenham [[post town]] includes the whole of the Becontree estate, including those sections that were in the former (pre 1965) boroughs of Barking and Ilford. Parts of the former borough of Dagenham - part of Chadwell Heath, part of Collier Row and part of Rush Green - are in the Romford Post town.\n\n(Dagenham is the name of a post town, and of a pre-1965 borough (and parish before that) with very different boundaries to the post town. Perhaps because of the name 'London Borough of Barking & Dagenham', adopted on 1 January 1980 to replace 'London Borough of Barking', there is an apparent popular - but incorrect - assumption that everywhere in that borough is either in Barking or in Dagenham. From 1965 it was true to say that everywhere in the then new London Borough was in one of the two former boroughs, but in the mid 1990s substantial areas of the London Borough of Redbridge were transferred to the borough, such that the entire Becontree and Padnall Estates were in LB Barking and Dagenham. Furthermore, parts of three post towns - Barking, Dagenham and Romford - cover the borough. The parliamentary constituency of Dagenham, formed in 1945, ceased to exist from the 2010 General Election, the six easternmost wards of LB Barking & Dagenham having become part of the Dagenham & Rainham Constituency,  with three wards in LB Havering, leaving most LB Barking & Dagenham wards in the enlarged Barking constituency.)\n\n==Demography==\nDagenham is a working class area.

Nine successive members of the Fanshawe family served as [[Remembrancer]] to the Crown, following Henry Fanshawe's appointment to the position by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1566. The appointment made possible the family's rise to prominence.\n\nIn the post town of Romford and the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, on the corner of Whalebone Lane and the Eastern Avenue, diagonally opposite the [[Moby-Dick]] public house, is the site of Marks Manor House, a large 15th-century moated building demolished in the early 19th century. During [[World War II]] the adjoining fields were used by the [[Royal Artillery]] for an anti-aircraft battery; later a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] for Germans was erected there. Further south down Whalebone Lane on the corner of the High Road is the Tollgate pub.

(editor in chief), ''Thoroughbred Breeding of the World'', Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970</ref> Betty Leedes was one of the few outside mares allowed to breed to the Darley Arabian, who was mostly kept as a private sire by his owner.<ref>[http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/DarleyArabian.html Tb Heritage]</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\nFlying Childers gained the name of his breeder, Colonel Leonard Childers, in addition to his owner, the Duke of Devonshire, often being referred to as either Devonshire Childers or Flying Childers or sometimes simply Childers.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=424}} Although the Duke received many offers for the colt, including one to pay for the horse's weight in gold, he remained the animal's owner throughout his life.\n\nFirst racing at age six, the 15.2 hand colt won his maiden race, held April 1721 at Newmarket, to defeat Speedwell over four miles. He then won his second race in October, also at Newmarket, in a walk over, and his third race against Almanzor. It is said he completed this race, over the Round Course at Newmarket, in 6 minutes, 40 seconds and that he reached a speed of 82 1/2 feet per second or 1 mile per minute.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=425}}  This was claimed to make Flying Childers the only horse on record as having matched the top speed of the unbeaten [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]].{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=131}}  By way of comparison, this would be nearly 40 seconds faster than the unbeaten [[Frankel (horse)|Frankel]] ran the Newmarket Rowley Mile in his famous [[2,000 Guineas]] victory of 2011, over 30 seconds faster than the current mile track record and very close to the five furlong track record set by [[Lochsong]] in 1994.<ref name=RP/>\n\nAs a seven-year-old, he won his one start, a race at Newmarket where he beat Chaunter. In 1723, he won both his starts by walk over, one in April at Newmarket, the other a matchrace against Bobsey, who forfeited. Flying Childers then retired to stud.\n\n===Summary===\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\" text-align:centre; margin-left:1em; float:centre ;border-collapse: collapse; font-size:80%\"\n|-  style=\"background:#dacaa4; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Date\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Race name\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Dist (miles)\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Course\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Prize\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Odds\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Runners\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Place\n! style=\"background:#dacaa4;\"| Runner-up\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1721|April|}}\n|Match race v.
