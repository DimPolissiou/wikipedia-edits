According to the Bureau of Land Management, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on public lands without a permit. In 1998, Bundy was prohibited by the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] from grazing his cattle on an area of land later called the Bunkerville Allotment. In July 2013, U.S. District Judge [[Lloyd D. George]] ordered that Bundy refrain from trespassing on federally administered land in the Gold Butte area of Clark County.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn March 27, 2014, {{convert|145604|acre|ha}} acres of federal land in Clark County were temporarily closed for the \"capture, impound, and removal of trespass cattle\". BLM officials and law enforcement rangers began a roundup of such livestock on April 5, and an arrest was made the next day. On April 12, a group of protesters, some of them armed, advanced on what the BLM described as a \"cattle gather\". Sheriff Doug Gillespie negotiated with Bundy and newly confirmed BLM director Neil Kornze, who elected to release the cattle and de-escalate the situation. As of the end of 2015, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on Federal land and had not paid the fees.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Cliven & Ammon Bundy (14742520503).jpg|thumb|Cliven Bundy with his son Ammon in 2014]]\nBundy has claimed he was a descendant of ''[[Mayflower]]'' [[Pilgrim fathers|Pilgrims]].<ref name=\"one year later\" />  Prior to his incarceration, Bundy lived in his family home which he built with his father.<ref name=\"one year later\"/> A Mormon,<ref name=\"ABC News profile\"/> he has many descendants, including 14 adult children<ref name=\"ABC News profile\"/> and 60 grandchildren.<ref name=\"one year later\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/cliven-bundy-standoff-grazing-rights-nevada-ranch|title=A year after armed standoff, Cliven Bundy still star of his own Tea Party-tinged Western|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-11-14|accessdate=2016-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131095126/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/cliven-bundy-standoff-grazing-rights-nevada-ranch|archive-date=2016-01-31|url-status=live}}</ref> His children include [[Ammon Bundy]] and [[Ryan C.

They didn't have nothing to do, they didn't have nothing for the kids to do, they didn't have nothing for the young girls to do. They were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton.

He expressed support for Blacks who have \"raised themselves up to a point where they are equal with the rest of us.\" As an alternative to government jobs and programs, he touted private-sector work. \"We don't need leeches feeding off us and eating off of us,\" he said. \"We need producers.\"<ref name=\"one year later\"/>\n\n===Response by public officials===\nThen Minority Leader Democratic U.S. Senator from Nevada, [[Harry Reid]], condemned the Bundy statement and said Bundy had, <blockquote>\"...revealed himself to be a hateful racist.

According to the Bureau of Land Management, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on public lands without a permit. In 1998, Bundy was prohibited by the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] from grazing his cattle on an area of land later called the Bunkerville Allotment. In July 2013, U.S. District Judge [[Lloyd D. George]] ordered that Bundy refrain from trespassing on federally administered land in the Gold Butte area of Clark County.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn March 27, 2014, {{convert|145604|acre|ha}} acres of federal land in Clark County were temporarily closed for the \"capture, impound, and removal of trespass cattle\". BLM officials and law enforcement rangers began a roundup of such livestock on April 5, and an arrest was made the next day. On April 12, a group of protesters, some of them armed, advanced on what the BLM described as a \"cattle gather\". Sheriff Doug Gillespie negotiated with Bundy and newly confirmed BLM director Neil Kornze, who elected to release the cattle and de-escalate the situation. As of the end of 2015, Bundy continued to graze his cattle on Federal land and had not paid the fees.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Cliven & Ammon Bundy (14742520503).jpg|thumb|Cliven Bundy with his son Ammon in 2014]]\nBundy has claimed he was a descendant of ''[[Mayflower]]'' [[Pilgrim fathers|Pilgrims]].<ref name=\"one year later\" />  Prior to his incarceration, Bundy lived in his family home which he built with his father.<ref name=\"one year later\"/> A Mormon,<ref name=\"ABC News profile\"/> he has many descendants, including 14 adult children<ref name=\"ABC News profile\"/> and 60 grandchildren.<ref name=\"one year later\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/cliven-bundy-standoff-grazing-rights-nevada-ranch|title=A year after armed standoff, Cliven Bundy still star of his own Tea Party-tinged Western|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-11-14|accessdate=2016-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131095126/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/cliven-bundy-standoff-grazing-rights-nevada-ranch|archive-date=2016-01-31|url-status=live}}</ref> His children include [[Ammon Bundy]] and [[Ryan C.

He recalled later seeing a public housing project in North Las Vegas where some of the older residents and the children sat on the porch. He said:\n\n{{quote|I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro. When I go to Las Vegas, north Las Vegas, and I would see these little Government houses, and in front of that Government house the door was usually open, and the older people and the kids and there was always at least half a dozen people on the porch. They didn't have nothing to do, they didn't have nothing for the kids to do, they didn't have nothing for the young girls to do. They were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.<ref name=Nagourney/><ref name=\"reuters1\"/>}}\n\nIn reference to Mexican people, he said:\n\n{{quote|They come over here against our Constitution and cross our borders, but they're here, and they're people ...

And don't tell me they don't have better family structures than most of us white people.<ref name=\"BenSwann on NYT\"/>}}\n\nA year later Bundy called the reaction to his statements a \"misunderstanding,\" saying he was not racist and that he should not have used the term \"Negro.\" He added: \"I've never had a black person or a brown person ever say anything bad about me.\" He then proceeded to make further statements about race, comparing \"welfare and housing\" to slavery. He expressed support for Blacks who have \"raised themselves up to a point where they are equal with the rest of us.\" As an alternative to government jobs and programs, he touted private-sector work. \"We don't need leeches feeding off us and eating off of us,\" he said. \"We need producers.\"<ref name=\"one year later\"/>\n\n===Response by public officials===\nThen Minority Leader Democratic U.S. Senator from Nevada, [[Harry Reid]], condemned the Bundy statement and said Bundy had, <blockquote>\"...revealed himself to be a hateful racist.
