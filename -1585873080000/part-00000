It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Joe Don Baker]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Gregory Peck]] in his final theatrical film role. In addition to Mitchum and Peck, [[Martin Balsam]] cameos in the remake; all three starred in the original film. The film tells the story of a convicted rapist, who, mostly by using his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous loopholes, seeks vengeance against a former [[public defender]], whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment because of the purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial.\n\n''Cape Fear'' marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro]]. The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success. It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Juliette Lewis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nSam Bowden ([[Nick Nolte]]) is a lawyer living in North Carolina with his wife Leigh ([[Jessica Lange]]) and teenage daughter Danielle ([[Juliette Lewis]]). [[Max Cady]] ([[Robert De Niro]]), a former client whom Sam failed to defend 14 years prior, is released from prison after 14 years; Cady was tried for rape and battery of a young woman and, Sam, appalled by the attack, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. \n\nCady, who studied law in prison but unsuccessfully appealed his conviction several times, tracks Sam down and begins to terrorise the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Cady arrested but Police Lieutenant Elgart says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady intentionally meets Bowden's colleague Lori. He later violently attacks and rapes her but she refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Sam hires a private investigator, Kerserk, to follow Cady.\n\nCady approaches Danielle at school by impersonating her new drama teacher, and they kiss. Sam warns Cady to leave him and his family alone or suffer the consequences, a conversation that Cady secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Sam also hire three men to beat Cady; as Sam watches from afar, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Cady then uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam.\n\nKersek assumes that Cady may try to enter the Bowden house while he believes Sam is out of town; the family fake his departure and hide in the house, hoping that Cady will break in so that he can be shot in self-defense. Cady kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and impersonates her to ambush and kill Kersek. Horrified after discovering the bodies, Sam, Leigh, and Danielle flee to their houseboat docked upstate along [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] river. \n\nCady, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danielle while making Sam watch. Danielle sprays Cady with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Cady clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm, a badly burned and deranged Cady confronts Sam, putting him on a [[mock trial]] to condemn him for withholding the specific evidence that would have given him a lighter sentence in jail. Despite Sam's insistence that his crime was too heinous for that evidence to be taken into account, Cady berates him for failing to properly do his duty as a lawyer. \n\nThe storm eventually knocks Cady off of his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam then uses Cady's handcuffs to shackle Cady to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Cady away and he drowns. Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danielle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as [[Max Cady]]\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as Sam Bowden\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Leigh Bowden\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Danielle Bowden\n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Claude Kersek\n*[[Robert Mitchum]] as Lt.

Webb (writer)|James R. Webb]], which was an adaptation from the novel ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]'' by [[John D. MacDonald]].\n\nIt was originally developed by [[Steven Spielberg]], who eventually decided it was too violent and traded it to Scorsese to get back ''[[Schindler's List]]'', which Scorsese had decided not to make. Spielberg stayed on as a producer, through his [[Amblin Entertainment]], but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEED9113FF933A25752C1A967958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM; Martin Scorsese Ventures Back To 'Cape Fear' | date=1991-11-10}}</ref>\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted [[Harrison Ford]] to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted [[Bill Murray]] to portray Cady.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Intense Facts About ''Cape Fear''|date=November 16, 2016|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88173/15-intense-facts-about-cape-fear|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNick Nolte is taller than Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until De Niro appeared to be the stronger man.

As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J. Lee Thompson]] specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had [[Bernard Hermann]] write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews by critics, with praise garnered towards its performances, direction, cinematography and editing.

However, he only lasted a few months with the company as Spivey was forced into retirement due to a buildup of previous injuries, and the character was abandoned. In 2013, WWE debuted [[Bray Wyatt]], another character partly based on not just De Niro's portrayal, but also Waylon Mercy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critics, not fans, should bite their tongues|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2013/07/15/pf-20975591.html|publisher=Slam!

A close up, sharing the same scary score of the movie, Uncle Leo is seen with \u201cJerry\u201d & \u201cHello\u201d tattooed on each hand. It's a clear reference to Robert De Niro's character in Cape Fear.\n\nIn the ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 1)#Episodes|Ricksy Business]]\", Lucy (the deranged maid who tries to rape Jerry) is shown clinging to the underside chassis of their car as they drive home, maniacally shouting \"Ha, I'm doing like in ''Cape Fear''!\"\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nIn the movie, Danielle is pictured reading [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s 1929 coming-of-age novel, ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]].''\n\nKersek tells Sam he saw Cady at the public library reading [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s classic philosophical novel ''[[Thus Spake Zarathustra]].''\n\nPretending to be Danielle's new drama teacher, Cady calls Danielle on the phone. After a short conversation, he plays [[Aretha Franklin]]'s single \"[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]].\"\n\nAlone with Danielle in the school's theater, Cady alludes to [[Henry Miller]]'s trilogy ''[[The Rosy Crucifixion]]'', which contains the books ''Plexus,'' ''Nexus,'' and ''Sexus.'' Danielle says she read parts of ''[[Tropic of Cancer]].''\n\nCady tells Sam he will teach him \"the meaning of commitment.\" He tells Sam to \"check out the [[Bible]], counselor. Look between [[Book of Esther|Esther]] and [[Psalms]].\" After staging his departure at the airport, Sam returns home covertly with Leigh and Danielle, and later discovers Cady was referring to the [[Book of Job]].\n\nCady quotes a translation of the 17th century priest, physician, mystic, and poet, [[Angelus Silesius]], saying: {{cquote|\n\n:I am like God, and God like me.\n:I am as Large as God, He is as small as I.\n:He cannot above me, nor I beneath him, be.\n|}}\n\nCady alludes to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', saying he is [[Virgil]] guiding Sam through the Ninth Circle of Hell, the last and lowest circle, reserved for traitors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[List of 1991 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n* [[Night and the City (1992 film)|''Night and the City'']], another remake also starring De Niro and Lange\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9snGGV1X5MC&printsec=frontcover&source=in Machura, Stefan and Robson, Peter, eds.

It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Joe Don Baker]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Robert Mitchum]], and [[Gregory Peck]] in his final theatrical film role. In addition to Mitchum and Peck, [[Martin Balsam]] cameos in the remake; all three starred in the original film. The film tells the story of a convicted rapist, who, mostly by using his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous loopholes, seeks vengeance against a former [[public defender]], whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment because of the purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial.\n\n''Cape Fear'' marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro]]. The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success. It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Juliette Lewis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nSam Bowden ([[Nick Nolte]] is a lawyer living in North Carolina with his wife Leigh ([[Jessica Lange]]) and teenage daughter Danielle ([[Juliette Lewis]]). [[Max Cady]] ([[Robert De Niro]]), a former client whom Sam failed to defend 14 years prior, is released from prison after 14 years; Cady was tried for rape and battery of a young woman and, Sam, appalled by the attack, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. \n\nCady, who studied law in prison but unsuccessfully appealed his conviction several times, tracks Sam down and begins to terrorise the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Cady arrested but Police Lieutenant Elgart says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady intentionally meets Bowden's colleague Lori. He later violently attacks and rapes her but she refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Sam hires a private investigator, Kerserk, to follow Cady.\n\nCady approaches Danielle at school by impersonating her new drama teacher, and they kiss. Sam warns Cady to leave him and his family alone or suffer the consequences, a conversation that Cady secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Sam also hire three men to beat Cady; as Sam watches from afar, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Cady then uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam.\n\nKersek assumes that Cady may try to enter the Bowden house while he believes Sam is out of town; the family fake his departure and hide in the house, hoping that Cady will break in so that he can be shot in self-defense. Cady kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and impersonates her to ambush and kill Kersek. Horrified after discovering the bodies, Sam, Leigh, and Danielle flee to their houseboat docked upstate along [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]] river. \n\nCady, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danielle while making Sam watch. Danielle sprays Cady with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Cady clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm, a badly burned and deranged Cady confronts Sam, putting him on a [[mock trial]] to condemn him for withholding the specific evidence that would have given him a lighter sentence in jail. Despite Sam's insistence that his crime was too heinous for that evidence to be taken into account, Cady berates him for failing to properly do his duty as a lawyer. \n\nThe storm eventually knocks Cady off of his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam then uses Cady's handcuffs to shackle Cady to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Cady away and he drowns. Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danielle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as [[Max Cady]]\n*[[Nick Nolte]] as Sam Bowden\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Leigh Bowden\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Danielle Bowden\n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Claude Kersek\n*[[Robert Mitchum]] as Lt.

Webb (writer)|James R. Webb]], which was an adaptation from the novel ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]'' by [[John D. MacDonald]].\n\nIt was originally developed by [[Steven Spielberg]], who eventually decided it was too violent and traded it to Scorsese to get back ''[[Schindler's List]]'', which Scorsese had decided not to make. Spielberg stayed on as a producer, through his [[Amblin Entertainment]], but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEED9113FF933A25752C1A967958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM; Martin Scorsese Ventures Back To 'Cape Fear' | date=1991-11-10}}</ref>\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted [[Harrison Ford]] to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted [[Bill Murray]] to portray Cady.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Intense Facts About ''Cape Fear''|date=November 16, 2016|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88173/15-intense-facts-about-cape-fear|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nNick Nolte is taller than Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until De Niro appeared to be the stronger man. De Niro reportedly took his body fat down to 4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-photos/juliette-lewis/?photo=c1048d1f-6e00-4876-b8f8-cfd730ace34d&gallery=22181|title=Showtimes, reviews, trailers, news and more - MSN Movies|publisher=|access-date=July 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923123011/http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-photos/juliette-lewis/?photo=c1048d1f-6e00-4876-b8f8-cfd730ace34d&gallery=22181|archive-date=September 23, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> De Niro also paid a doctor $5,000 to grind down his teeth for the role to give the character a more menacing look, later paying $20,000 to have his teeth restored after the film production was over.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stars who went too far for movie roles|url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/stars-who-went-too-far-for-movie-roles.html|publisher=Yahoo!}}</ref>\n\nThe work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was also influential on the style of ''Cape Fear''. As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J. Lee Thompson]] specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had [[Bernard Hermann]] write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35 million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews by critics, with praise garnered towards its performances, direction, cinematography and editing. It received a 73% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the film aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 7.06/10. The consensus reads, \"Smart and stylish, ''Cape Fear'' is a gleefully mainstream shocker from Martin Scorsese, with a terrifying Robert De Niro performance.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1037581-cape_fear/ |title=''Cape Fear'' at RottenTomatoes.com |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 73 out of 100 based on 9 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cape-fear |title=Cape Fear Reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2016-06-11}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars, commenting: \"''Cape Fear'' is impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions.

They also pay homage to another Robert Mitchum film ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' in which Sideshow Bob's knuckles (scaled down for a cartoon character with one fewer finger on each hand) say \"Luv\" (Love) and \"H\u0101t\" (Hate, with the diacritical mark providing the long vowel).\n\nIn 1995, professional wrestler [[Dan Spivey]] made his [[WWE]] (then WWF) debut under the ring name, Walylon Mercy, with his [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] based on De Niro's portrayal of Max Cady. However, he only lasted a few months with the company as Spivey was forced into retirement due to a buildup of previous injuries, and the character was abandoned. In 2013, WWE debuted [[Bray Wyatt]], another character partly based on not just De Niro's portrayal, but also Waylon Mercy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Critics, not fans, should bite their tongues|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2013/07/15/pf-20975591.html|publisher=Slam!

A close up, sharing the same scary score of the movie, Uncle Leo is seen with \u201cJerry\u201d & \u201cHello\u201d tattooed on each hand. It's a clear reference to Robert De Niro's character in Cape Fear.\n\nIn the ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' episode \"[[Rick and Morty (season 1)#Episodes|Ricksy Business]]\", Lucy (the deranged maid who tries to rape Jerry) is shown clinging to the underside chassis of their car as they drive home, maniacally shouting \"Ha, I'm doing like in ''Cape Fear''!\"\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nIn the movie, Danielle is pictured reading [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s 1929 coming-of-age novel, ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]].''\n\nKersek tells Sam he saw Cady at the public library reading [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s classic philosophical novel ''[[Thus Spake Zarathustra]].''\n\nPretending to be Danielle's new drama teacher, Cady calls Danielle on the phone. After a short conversation, he plays [[Aretha Franklin]]'s single \"[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]].\"\n\nAlone with Danielle in the school's theater, Cady alludes to [[Henry Miller]]'s trilogy ''[[The Rosy Crucifixion]]'', which contains the books ''Plexus,'' ''Nexus,'' and ''Sexus.'' Danielle says she read parts of ''[[Tropic of Cancer]].''\n\nCady tells Sam he will teach him \"the meaning of commitment.\" He tells Sam to \"check out the [[Bible]], counselor. Look between [[Book of Esther|Esther]] and [[Psalms]].\" After staging his departure at the airport, Sam returns home covertly with Leigh and Danielle, and later discovers Cady was referring to the [[Book of Job]].\n\nCady quotes a translation of the 17th century priest, physician, mystic, and poet, [[Angelus Silesius]], saying: {{cquote|\n\n:I am like God, and God like me.\n:I am as Large as God, He is as small as I.\n:He cannot above me, nor I beneath him, be.\n|}}\n\nCady alludes to [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', saying he is [[Virgil]] guiding Sam through the Ninth Circle of Hell, the last and lowest circle, reserved for traitors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[List of 1991 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n* [[Night and the City (1992 film)|''Night and the City'']], another remake also starring De Niro and Lange\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9snGGV1X5MC&printsec=frontcover&source=in Machura, Stefan and Robson, Peter, eds.

It was selected for [[Oprah's Book Club]] in 2000, was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] for Fiction, and was adapted into the 2003 film, ''[[House of Sand and Fog (film)|House of Sand and Fog]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe novel begins by introducing Massoud Behrani, a former Iranian air force colonel who fled from Iran after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Because his background is military rather than professional, he has not been able to establish a career in the US and works as a trash collector and convenience store clerk. With savings, he pays the rent on an expensive apartment for his family and for an elegant wedding for his daughter, and his fellow, more successful Iranian exiles do not know that he holds low-skilled jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, Kathy Nicolo, a former drug addict who is still recovering from her husband abruptly leaving her, has been evicted from her home, long owned by her family, because of unpaid taxes the county wrongfully claimed she owed. When the house is placed for auction, Behrani seizes the opportunity and purchases it, depleting his son's entire college fund. He plans to renovate the house and then resell it for much more than he originally paid as a first step on the way to establishing himself in real-estate investment. He moves his family from their apartment into the house. Meanwhile, when Kathy moves out, she meets Deputy Lester Burdon. They go through the system, hiring a lawyer to fight Kathy's wrongful eviction, but although the County admits the error, Behrani insists that he will not return the house unless he's paid what it's worth, not merely the low sum he paid at auction.\n\nIn desperation, Kathy goes to the house and attempts to commit suicide twice, first trying to shoot herself and then overdosing on pills. The Behranis manage to stop her both times and she is put in a bedroom to rest. Lester breaks into the house and locks the Behranis in their bathroom at gunpoint until they agree to return the house to Kathy. When Lester takes the Behranis to the county office, Behrani's son, Esmail, retrieves the gun and is shot by authorities. When Behrani finds out in the hospital that his son has died, he is overcome with grief and rage at both Lester and Kathy. He returns to the house to find Kathy still there and attempts to strangle her. Believing Kathy to be dead, he dons his Army uniform and suffocates both himself and his wife, who had been asleep in the bedroom.\n\nKathy and Lester are arrested and await trial. In the novel's final scene, Kathy, unable to speak after her final encounter with Behrani, mimes a request for one more cigarette.\n\n==Film adaptation==\nIn 2003 the novel was adapted into a [[House of Sand and Fog (film)|film of the same title]] starring [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Jennifer Connelly]]. While the novel suggests that experiences in Lester Burdon's youth were responsible for some of his rash decisions, the movie does not attempt to explain any of his motivations. The movie's ending differs from that of the novel, removing the final confrontation between Behrani and Kathy. The consequences of the Behranis' deaths on Kathy are also not explored in the movie.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070121072839/http://www2.oprah.com/obc/pastbooks/andre_dubusIII/obc_pb_20001116.jhtml Page on ''House of Sand and Fog'' on Oprah's Book Club website]\n\n[[Category:1999 American novels]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:W.

In a [[Major League Baseball|major league]] career that stretched from 1973 to 1993, he pitched for the [[California Angels]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Detroit Tigers]], [[New York Mets]], and [[New York Yankees]]. He struck out 2,773 batters in his career and twice won playoff-clinching games for the teams he was on, the 1979 Angels and the 1987 Tigers.\n\nRaised in northwest [[Detroit]], Tanana was a [[1971 Major League Baseball Draft|first-round draft pick]] by the Angels in 1971. He made his debut with the team in 1973 and won 14 games his rookie year. Tanana and fellow starter [[Nolan Ryan]] formed one of the toughest pairs of starting pitchers to hit against in baseball. Tanana led the [[American League]] (AL) in [[strikeout]]s in 1975, then made the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] three years in a row. He won 19 games in 1976 and led the AL with a 2.54 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in 1977. In 1979, he won the game that clinched the Angels' first-ever playoff appearance. Injuries began to take their toll on him by the end of his tenure with the Angels, and he changed his style from relying on a hard [[fastball]] to throwing a repertoire of slower pitches, using deception to get hitters out instead.\n\nTanana was traded to Boston for the 1981 season; he went 4-10 with the Red Sox before becoming a [[free agent]] and signing with the Rangers. He tied for the AL lead in losses his first year with Texas, then failed to make their rotation at the start of the 1983 season, though he returned to it in June. In 1984, he had a 15-15 record for the team, his most wins since 1978. After getting off to a poor start with Texas in 1985, he was traded to Detroit, the team he rooted for growing up.  Tanana would stay with the Tigers through 1992, pitching eight seasons with the club. He threw a shutout in the final game of the 1987 season to clinch a playoff spot for the team, winning 15 games that year. In 1988, he won 14 games; in 1989, he posted a 3.58 ERA. He was removed from the rotation for a time in 1990, only winning nine games that year, but the next season, he became the Tigers' first pitcher besides [[Jack Morris]] to start on [[Opening Day]] since 1979. This was the fifth Opening Day start of Tanana's career, as he had made four for the Angels in the 1970s. He won 13 games apiece in 1991 and 1992 before pitching one more season with the Mets and the Yankees in 1993.\n\nAfter becoming a [[born-again Christian]] in November 1983, Tanana became a leader among baseball's Christian community.

In a [[Major League Baseball|major league]] career that stretched from 1973 to 1993, he pitched for the [[California Angels]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Detroit Tigers]], [[New York Mets]], and [[New York Yankees]]. He struck out 2,773 batters in his career and twice won playoff-clinching games for the teams he was on, the 1979 Angels and the 1987 Tigers.\n\nRaised in northwest [[Detroit]], Tanana was a [[1971 Major League Baseball Draft|first-round draft pick]] by the Angels in 1971. He made his debut with the team in 1973 and won 14 games his rookie year. Tanana and fellow starter [[Nolan Ryan]] formed one of the toughest pairs of starting pitchers to hit against in baseball. Tanana led the [[American League]] (AL) in [[strikeout]]s in 1975, then made the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] three years in a row. He won 19 games in 1976 and led the AL with a 2.54 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in 1977. In 1979, he won the game that clinched the Angels' first-ever playoff appearance. Injuries began to take their toll on him by the end of his tenure with the Angels, and he changed his style from relying on a hard [[fastball]] to throwing a repertoire of slower pitches, using deception to get hitters out instead.\n\nTanana was traded to Boston for the 1981 season; he went 4-10 with the Red Sox before becoming a [[free agent]] and signing with the Rangers. He tied for the AL lead in losses his first year with Texas, then failed to make their rotation at the start of the 1983 season, though he returned to it in June. In 1984, he had a 15-15 record for the team, his most wins since 1978. After getting off to a poor start with Texas in 1985, he was traded to Detroit, the team he rooted for growing up.  Tanana would stay with the Tigers through 1992, pitching eight seasons with the club. He threw a shutout in the final game of the 1987 season to clinch a playoff spot for the team, winning 15 games that year. In 1988, he won 14 games; in 1989, he posted a 3.58 ERA. He was removed from the rotation for a time in 1990, only winning nine games that year, but the next season, he became the Tigers' first pitcher besides [[Jack Morris]] to start on [[Opening Day]] since 1979. This was the fifth Opening Day start of Tanana's career, as he had made four for the Angels in the 1970s. He won 13 games apiece in 1991 and 1992 before pitching one more season with the Mets and the Yankees in 1993.\n\nAfter becoming a [[born-again Christian]] in November 1983, Tanana became a leader among baseball's Christian community. He has continued to serve in the ministry following his retirement, serving as an elder in his church, assisting the Tigers' chaplain, and performing [[Bible study (Christianity)|Bible studies]] and [[marriage counselling]]. He lives in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]].\n\n==Early life==\nTanana grew up in the northwest part of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=\"No Second Banana\">{{cite web|last=Fimrite|first=Ron|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1977/07/11/621887/this-guy-tananas-no-second-banana|title=This Guy Tanana's No Second Banana|work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 11, 1977|accessdate=February 22, 2020}}</ref> His father, also named Frank, had played professional baseball in the 1950s and was on the 1955 Eastern League championship team, the [[New Britain Rock Cats|Reading Indians]], before he left baseball and joined the [[Detroit Police Department]] to support his family.<ref name=\"Lukas\">{{cite news|last1=Lukas|first1=Paul|title=Tanana and the Indians|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19710616&id=piArAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Zp4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6728,3746147&hl=en|accessdate=June 21, 2016|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|date=June 16, 1971}}</ref> After young Frank got done with homework, he and his friends would spend the rest of the afternoon playing various sports.<ref name=\"Tiger Trade\"/><ref name=\"No Second Banana\"/> He rooted for the hometown [[Detroit Tigers]] growing up, listing [[Al Kaline]], [[Mickey Lolich]], [[Willie Horton (baseball)|Willie Horton]], and [[Mickey Stanley]] among his favorite players.<ref name=\"no surgery\"/>\n\nTanana attended [[Detroit Catholic Central High School]], an all-boys school; though it was seven miles from his home, he was attracted to it after seeing their basketball team featured on the front page of a newspaper sports section.

In a cocky moment his senior year, he threw [[Sidearm (baseball)|sidearm]] to a hitter and injured his shoulder. He pitched through the injury for the rest of the year until leaving the mound after the fourth inning of the championship game, when the pain got to be too much for him. Thinking the injury would hurt his baseball chances, he had just about decided to attend [[Duke University]] on a basketball scholarship when the [[California Angels]] made him their first-round draft pick in [[1971 Major League Baseball Draft|1971]].<ref name=\"Tiger Trade\"/><ref name=\"No Second Banana\"/> \n\n==Minor league career==\nTanana was assigned to the Rookie [[Idaho Falls Angels]] in 1971, but tendinitis in his shoulder prevented him from pitching.
