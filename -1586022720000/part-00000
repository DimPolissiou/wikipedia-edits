This made the community one of the best-known places in Dallas County during the 1840s because of its advertising throughout [[Europe]] and the United States. [[Baptist]] minister William Bowles opened a [[blacksmith]] shop and [[gristmill]] in 1845. On May 5, 1845, Isaac B.

It was absorbed by the [[Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad]] in 1881. The community had a population of approximately 100 by 1890 with several businesses.

In 1956, a home rule charter was approved that adopted a council-manager form of government. The rapid growth of the city during the 1950s was made apparent in the 1960 census, which recorded a total of 13,441 residents, a 1,369 percent increase over the 1950 figure. Most of the new residents commuted to nearby Dallas for employment.<ref name=\"Texas Escapes\"/> The population topped 27,000 by 1970. A variety of manufacturers producing items such as steel products, concrete, asphalt, cosmetics, and food products were operating in the city. The number of residents declined to 24,863 in 1980 and 24,250 in 1990. The falling population was offset, however, by the wide variety of businesses located in the city. Farmers Branch is home to a large number of corporations that have attained frontage along [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]], the [[Dallas North Tollway]], and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]].

In 1956, a home rule charter was approved that adopted a council-manager form of government. The rapid growth of the city during the 1950s was made apparent in the 1960 census, which recorded a total of 13,441 residents, a 1,369 percent increase over the 1950 figure. Most of the new residents commuted to nearby Dallas for employment.<ref name=\"Texas Escapes\"/> The population topped 27,000 by 1970. A variety of manufacturers producing items such as steel products, concrete, asphalt, cosmetics, and food products were operating in the city. The number of residents declined to 24,863 in 1980 and 24,250 in 1990. The falling population was offset, however, by the wide variety of businesses located in the city. Farmers Branch is home to a large number of corporations that have attained frontage along [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]], the [[Dallas North Tollway]], and [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]]. Its Dallas North Tollway segment is part of the [[Platinum Corridor]], and its land along Interstate 635 is an extension of the lengthy Irving Prairie office park. By 2000, the city's population had grown to 27,508.<ref name=\"Texas Handbook\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1950= 915\n|1960= 13441\n|1970= 27492\n|1980= 24863\n|1990= 24250\n|2000= 27508\n|2010= 28616\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=40209\n|estref=<ref name=\"US Census Quick Facts for Farmers Branch city, Texas\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/farmersbranchcitytexas#|title=US Census Quick Facts for Farmers Branch city, Texas|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:JPMorganChaseDallas-1JIP-200306.jpg|thumb|JP Morgan Chase Bank in Farmers Branch]]As of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 28,616 people, 19,797 households, and 6,923 families residing in the city.

It carried the meaning of \"land of cows\". In Chinese, the same name was written as ''Yu-t'ien'', pronounced as ''Gu-dana''. The pronunciation changed over the years to Kho-tan. In the 7th century, [[Xuanzang]] tried to reverse interpret it in Sanskrit as ''Kustana''.

It provided a convenient meeting place where not only goods, but technologies, philosophies, and religions were transmitted from one culture to another.\n\n[[Tocharians]] lived in this region over 2000 years ago. Several of the [[Tarim mummies]] were found in the region.

The excavated sites range from about 300 BCE to 100 CE.

It serves regional flights to [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]]. Originally a military use airport, it was expanded significantly in 2002 to accommodate higher passenger volumes. It is located {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} south of the city proper.\n\n===Road===\nHotan is served by [[China National Highway 315]], which runs along the southern Tarim Basin from Ruoqiang to Kashgar, and the Trans-Taklamakan Desert Highway, which run north to Luntai. An expressway is being built between Hotan and [[Karakax County]] (Moyu) as of 2014.\n\n===Rail===\nHotan is connected to the rest of China's rail network via the [[Kashgar\u2013Hotan Railway]], which opened to freight traffic in December 2010, and passenger service in June 2011.  The railway station was constructed by a company under the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]], and is located in the town of Lasqi ({{lang|zh|\u62c9\u65af\u594e}}) northwest of the city proper.  Passenger train service on this line is limited, with only one train per day, local service 5828/5825, linking the city with Kashgar (8~ hours) and \u00dcr\u00fcmqi (~34 hours).\n\n===Buses===\nRegular bus services link Hotan with Kashgar. There is also an express bus to Aksu via the {{convert|430|km|abbr=on}} 'Hotan-Aksu Cross-Desert Highway' which was opened in 2007, travels alongside the intermittent [[Hotan River]], and which takes about 5 or 6 hours. This same bus then goes on to Urumchi taking a total of about 21 hours from Hotan.<ref>Harper et al (2009), p. 840.</ref>\n\n==Products==\n[[File:'Mutton fat' jade for sale at Khotan Jade Market.jpg|thumb|right|Light coloured or \"Mutton fat\" jade for sale at Hotan Jade Market]]\n[[File:Silk weaving in Khotan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silk]] weaving in Hotan]]\n\n===Nephrite jade===\nChinese historical sources indicate that Hotan was the main source of the [[nephrite]] jade used in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]]. For several hundred years, until they were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] in 176 BCE, the trade of Khotanese jade into China was controlled by the nomadic [[Yuezhi]]. The Chinese still refer to the Yurungkash as the [[White Jade River]], alluding to the white [[jade]] recovered from its [[alluvium|alluvial deposits]]. The light coloured jade is called \"Mutton fat\" jade. Most of the jade is now gone, with only a few kilos of good quality jade found yearly. Some is still mined in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] to the south in the summer,<ref name=autogenerated1>Bonavia, Judy. ''The Silk Road: Xi'an to Kashgar.''

Silk weaving by [[Uyghurs|Uyghur women]] is a thriving [[Putting-out system#Cottage industry|cottage industry]], some of it produced using traditional methods.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Hotan Silk Factory]] is one of the notable silk producers in Hotan.\n\n[[Silk in the Indian subcontinent#Tanchoi|Atlas]] is the fabric used for traditional Uyghur clothing worn by Uyghur women. It is soft, light and graceful tie-dyed silk fabric. It comes various colours, the brighter and rich colours are for small children to young ladies. The gray and dark colours are for elderly women.\n\nThe oldest piece of [[kilim]] which we have any knowledge was obtained by the archaeological explorer [[Aurel Stein]]; a fragment from an ancient settlement near Hotan, which was buried by sand drifts about the fourth century CE.

It lies just north of the [[Kunlun Mountains]], which are crossed by the [[Sanju Pass|Sanju]], [[Hindutash]] and Ilchi passes. The town, located southeast of [[Yarkant County]] and populated almost exclusively by [[Uyghurs]], is a minor agricultural center. An important station on the southern branch of the historic [[Silk Road]], Hotan has always depended on two strong rivers - the [[Karakash River]] and the [[White Jade River]] to provide the water needed to survive on the southwestern edge of the vast [[Taklamakan Desert]].

It carried the meaning of \"land of cows\". In Chinese, the same name was written as ''Yu-t'ien'', pronounced as ''Gu-dana''. The pronunciation changed over the years to Kho-tan. In the 7th century, [[Xuanzang]] tried to reverse interpret it in Sanskrit as ''Kustana''.

It provided a convenient meeting place where not only goods, but technologies, philosophies, and religions were transmitted from one culture to another.\n\n[[Tocharians]] lived in this region over 2000 years ago. Several of the [[Tarim mummies]] were found in the region. At Sampul, east of the city of Hotan, there is an extensive series of cemeteries scattered over an area about {{convert|1|km}} wide and {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} long. The excavated sites range from about 300 BCE to 100 CE. The excavated graves have produced a number of fabrics of [[felt]], [[wool]], [[silk]] and [[cotton]] and even a fine bit of tapestry, the [[Sampul tapestry]], showing the face of [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] man which was made of threads of 24 shades of colour. The tapestry had been cut up and fashioned into trousers worn by one of the deceased. An Anthropological study of 56 individuals showed a primarily Caucasoid population.<ref>Mallory, J.

The inhabitants of the Kingdom of Khotan, like those of early [[Shule Kingdom|Kashgar]] and [[Yarkant County|Yarkant]], spoke [[Saka language|Saka]], one of the [[Eastern Iranian languages]]. Khotan's indigenous dynasty (all of whose royal names are Indian in origin) governed a fervently Buddhist city-state boasting some 400 temples in the late 9th/early 10th century\u2014four times the number recorded by [[Xuanzang]] around 630.

Khotan enjoyed close relations with the Buddhist centre at Dunhuang: the Khotanese royal family intermarried with Dunhuang \u00e9lites, visited and patronised Dunhuang's Buddhist temple complex, and donated money to have their portraits painted on the walls of the Mogao grottos.

The railway station was constructed by a company under the [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps]], and is located in the town of Lasqi ({{lang|zh|\u62c9\u65af\u594e}}) northwest of the city proper.

Originally produced for CBC for the 1988\u201389 season, it was later picked up for American television syndication, airing from September 18, 1989 to March 16, 1990 with repeats later airing on the [[USA Network]] from June 28 to December 31, 1993 and on [[GameTV]] from January 3, 2011 to September 2015, and again since July 1, 2019. Taped at stage 40 of [[CBC Regional Broadcast Centre Vancouver|CBC's Vancouver studios]], the show was hosted by Wayne Cox with local radio personality Dean Hill as announcer.\n\n==Gameplay==\nTwo teams of two people, one team usually returning champions, played. \n\nEach round of play was conducted in the same manner. The game started with the champions playing first and each subsequent round saw the teams taking turns. The team that was not playing in a particular round was stationed at a desk to the side of the play area, where they would place headphones on their ears and keep their backs turned to their opponents so they could neither see nor hear anything. Cox would give the team playing a choice of two subjects to talk about. The team captain would then choose the subject and who would speak first.\n\nThere were ten words associated with each subject that were selected by the show's producers and the team tried to come up with as many as they could. Each word was worth one point and each team member had one chance to talk per round, having twenty seconds to do so. If, between them, the team could come up with all ten words, they won  a [[Canadian dollar|$]]500 bonus and received ten points. If not, the points from the keywords they had already said could be stolen by the opposing team. After they were brought out of isolation, the other team was shown the keywords the other team had not said and given a chance to steal the points with a right answer. If they could not, the points remained with the first team.\n\nPlay continued in this manner until one of the teams reached fifteen points. The first team to do this won the game and $100, and advanced to the bonus round, while the losing team received parting gifts. All players received a copy of the ''Talk About'' home game.\n\nGames could straddle from the end of one episode to the start of the next. This rule was changed for celebrity weeks; when time ran out at the end of an episode, the team in the lead won the game and received prizes for the charity sponsoring them.\n\nAny team that won five consecutive games retired undefeated and collected the Grand Game Jackpot. This was a prize package worth $1,000 in the first season; during the second season, it began at this value and a prize was added every time new champions were crowned up to $10,000, until a team claimed it. The biggest Grand Game Jackpot won on the show was $10,000.\n\n==Bonus round==\nThe winning team played the bonus round for a bonus prize and up to $2,000 in cash.\n\nThe team captain chose one of two prizes to play for and one of two topics to discuss. He/she then decided which member would speak first, and the partner entered an isolation booth. As in the main game, the talking player had 20 seconds to say as many keywords as possible from a list of 10. Each word awarded $100; if the talking player said all of them, the team immediately won $2,000 and the prize.\n\nAny words that remained unsaid after 20 seconds were shown to the talking player, who then had to choose whether to continue the round or stop and take the accumulated money. If he/she chose to continue, his/her partner was brought out of the booth and had to try to come up with any of the unsaid words. One second was given for every word that had been said by the talking player, for a maximum of nine seconds. If the partner succeeded, the team won the prize and their bonus money was doubled; if not, they forfeited the money.\n\n==Home version==\nA home version of the game was produced by [[Pressman Toy Corporation]] in 1989.

The only difference was in the bonus round, where each word was worth \u00a320, and at the end, the player had two options: \"doubling\", by having their partner say any unsaid word or \"double-doubling\" (4 times the pounds) by having them say a specific word within a time limit of 1 second per word already said.\n\nLars Gustafsson hosted a Swedish version called ''Prata p\u00e5!'' which ran briefly on TV4 in the mid-1990s. In the bonus round, each word was worth 500 kronor, and the \"doubling\" option required the partner to say any one of the unsaid words within a time limit of one second per word already said.\n\nAn Irish version of the show was broadcast by RT\u00c9 in the early 1990s on Saturday nights, it was presented by Ian Dempsey. The show was brought back to RT\u00c9 in the mid-1990s and was this time presented by Alan Hughes.

The population was 2,037 at the 2010 census.\n\nFarmer City is part of [[Blue Ridge Community Unit School District 18]] sharing facilities with nearby [[Mansfield, Illinois|Mansfield]] and [[Bellflower, Illinois]]. Farmer City facilities include the District Unit Office, the Ruth M.

The westward push of traders and adventurers led to settlers around 1825. Dennis Hurley is believed to be the first white settler in the area; build a cabin, the area became known as Hurley's Grove with other families settling the area. Founding  families    were the Kirbys, McCords, Clearwaters, Watsons, Johnson, Webb, Blalach, Weedmans, Coveys, Cummings and Huddlestons. Hurley's Grove was just south of present-day Farmer City, with increased population by 1837, becoming part of DeWitt County in 1839.\n\nThe area to the south of Hurley's Grove solidified as a permanent settlement, within the wooded areas safety. North of the primary area became known as Mt. Pleasant. [[Subdivision (land)|Subdivision]] of the land divided the area into 14 blocks, with a central public square; the first residence built was that of Nathan Clearwater, and William McFall opened a store in 1837. Mail delivery was established in 1837, but with [[Mount Pleasant Township, Whiteside County, Illinois|another Mt. Pleasant]] in the state, the name changed to [[Santa Anna Township, DeWitt County, Illinois|Santa Anna]].\n\nDewitt County was part of the Eighth Judicial District in the early 1850s, and lawyer [[Abraham Lincoln]] traveled in the area many times on his circuit; he was well respected by county residents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stites|first=Helen|title=Finding Lincoln in DeWitt County|year=2006|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4259-1246-8|page=59|oclc=69992099}}</ref> [[C.

The area became connected in 1870 by rail, prospering; that year's census listed 1276 people in the township, and 537 in Mt. Pleasant. The necessity of an official name arose in 1869, with Farmer City chosen after much discussion and debate. The business district was destroyed in 1879 by a major fire, but the town was rebuilt. The rebuilding process had to be rebooted after an 1894 fire destroyed the new business district.\n\nThe early years of the next century saw Farmer City grow into a bustling community. A newspaper, the ''Public Reaper'', first printed on November 27, 1879.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Reaper - First Edition 1879 |url=http://dewitt.ilgenweb.net/public-reaper-1879.htm |work=Public Reaper |publisher=DeWitt GenWeb Project |access-date=26 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814135949/http://dewitt.ilgenweb.net/public-reaper-1879.htm |archive-date=14 August 2011 |df= }}</ref> City fathers helped usher the area into a modern era, with utilities such as a water tower (1920). The new business district was joined by schools, churches, and fine homes. [[Interstate 74 in Illinois|Interstate 74]] was completed in the early 1970s.

The westward push of traders and adventurers led to settlers around 1825. Dennis Hurley is believed to be the first white settler in the area; build a cabin, the area became known as Hurley's Grove with other families settling the area. Founding  families    were the Kirbys, McCords, Clearwaters, Watsons, Johnson, Webb, Blalach, Weedmans, Coveys, Cummings and Huddlestons. Hurley's Grove was just south of present-day Farmer City, with increased population by 1837, becoming part of DeWitt County in 1839.\n\nThe area to the south of Hurley's Grove solidified as a permanent settlement, within the wooded areas safety. North of the primary area became known as Mt. Pleasant. [[Subdivision (land)|Subdivision]] of the land divided the area into 14 blocks, with a central public square; the first residence built was that of Nathan Clearwater, and William McFall opened a store in 1837. Mail delivery was established in 1837, but with [[Mount Pleasant Township, Whiteside County, Illinois|another Mt. Pleasant]] in the state, the name changed to [[Santa Anna Township, DeWitt County, Illinois|Santa Anna]].\n\nDewitt County was part of the Eighth Judicial District in the early 1850s, and lawyer [[Abraham Lincoln]] traveled in the area many times on his circuit; he was well respected by county residents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stites|first=Helen|title=Finding Lincoln in DeWitt County|year=2006|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4259-1246-8|page=59|oclc=69992099}}</ref> [[C.

The area became connected in 1870 by rail, prospering; that year's census listed 1276 people in the township, and 537 in Mt. Pleasant. The necessity of an official name arose in 1869, with Farmer City chosen after much discussion and debate. The business district was destroyed in 1879 by a major fire, but the town was rebuilt. The rebuilding process had to be rebooted after an 1894 fire destroyed the new business district.\n\nThe early years of the next century saw Farmer City grow into a bustling community. A newspaper, the ''Public Reaper'', first printed on November 27, 1879.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Reaper - First Edition 1879 |url=http://dewitt.ilgenweb.net/public-reaper-1879.htm |work=Public Reaper |publisher=DeWitt GenWeb Project |access-date=26 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814135949/http://dewitt.ilgenweb.net/public-reaper-1879.htm |archive-date=14 August 2011 |df= }}</ref> City fathers helped usher the area into a modern era, with utilities such as a water tower (1920).

The film was directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], and stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Thomas F. Wilson]] and [[Lea Thompson]]. The film continues immediately following ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989); while stranded in 1955 during his [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] adventures, [[Marty McFly]] (Fox) discovers that his friend [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] (Lloyd), trapped in 1885, was killed by [[Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen]] (Wilson), [[Biff Tannen|Biff]]'s great-grandfather. Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with [[Clara Clayton]] (Steenburgen).\n\n''Back to the Future Part III'' was filmed in [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and was produced on a $40 million budget [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''Part II''. ''Part III'' was released in the United States on May 25, 1990, six months after the previous installment, and grossed earned $244 million worldwide during its initial run, making it the [[1990 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 1990]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/1990/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|title=1990 Worldwide Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=March 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\nOn November 12, 1955, moments after witnessing Doc vanish with the DeLorean from a lightning bolt, [[Marty McFly]] (from 1985) learns that [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett Brown]] (also from 1985) was transported to 1885 and is trapped.{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''.}} Marty and the 1955 Doc use the information in Doc's 1885 letter to find and repair the [[DMC DeLorean|DeLorean]] so that Marty can return to 1985, and instructs Marty to not come back for him. Marty spots a tombstone with Doc's name, dated six days after the letter, and learns that Doc was killed by [[Biff Tannen]]'s great-grandfather, Buford. Marty photographs the tombstone and travels to 1885 to save Doc.\n\nMarty arrives on September 2, 1885, in the middle of a [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] pursuit of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. When the DeLorean's fuel line is torn, Marty hides the car in a cave and walks to [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]]. He meets his Irish-born great-great-grandparents, [[Maggie McFly#Seamus and Maggie McFly|Seamus and Maggie McFly]], and runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford attempts to [[Lynching|lynch]] Marty, but Doc rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885 after seeing the photograph, but without gasoline, the DeLorean cannot reach {{convert|88|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nDoc devises a plan to use a train [[locomotive]] to push the DeLorean up to the required speed. While he and Marty explore a [[Branch line|rail spur]] they intend to use, they spot a runaway horse-drawn wagon. Doc saves the passenger, [[Clara Clayton]], and the two fall in love. At a town festival, Buford tries killing Doc, but Marty thwarts him. Buford insults Marty and challenges him to a showdown in two days; in his anger, Marty accepts. Doc warns Marty not to get provoked by name calling and lets it slip that Marty gets into a car accident in the future. Doc's name in the photograph of the tombstone is erased but the date and tombstone itself still remain.\n\nMarty and Doc place the DeLorean onto the spur. Doc makes Marty promise that once he returns to 1985 the DeLorean will be destroyed, but Marty convinces Doc to leave with him. Unable to convince Clara that he is from the future, Doc is spurned. He goes to the saloon for a [[Binge drinking|binge]]. Doc drinks a single shot of whiskey and passes out. Buford arrives and calls out Marty, but Marty observes \"[[Clint Eastwood]]\" (his 1885 alias) appear on the tombstone in the photograph, so refuses to duel. Doc awakens after drinking the bartender's special [[Prairie oyster|\"Wake-Up Juice\"]] and tries fleeing with Marty, but Buford's gang captures Doc, forcing Marty to duel. After fooling Buford into thinking he has killed Marty using a bulletproof plate, Marty knocks Buford into a wagon full of manure. Buford is arrested for an earlier robbery.\n\nAs Clara leaves on the train, she overhears a salesman discussing how heartbroken Doc was. Clara applies the [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] and returns to town. She discovers Doc's model of the time machine and rides after him. Stealing the locomotive at gunpoint, Doc and Marty begin pushing the DeLorean along the spur line. Clara boards the locomotive while Doc climbs toward the DeLorean. Doc encourages Clara to join him, but she falls, hanging precariously by her dress. Marty passes his [[hoverboard]] to Doc so he can save Clara. They coast away from the locomotive as it falls off an unfinished railroad bridge; Marty travels to 1985 on the completed bridge.\n\nMarty arrives on October 27, 1985, escaping the powerless DeLorean before it is destroyed by an oncoming train. He discovers that everything has returned to the initial post-time travel timeline, and finds Jennifer sleeping on her front porch. He uses the lessons he learned in 1885 to avoid being goaded into a street race with Douglas J. Needles, avoiding a possible automobile accident. Remembering that this accident would have sent Marty's life spiraling downward, Jennifer opens a fax message she kept from 2015, and watches as its text regarding Marty's firing disappears.\n\nAs Marty and Jennifer examine the DeLorean wreckage, a flying steam locomotive equipped with a [[DeLorean time machine#flux capacitor|flux capacitor]] appears, manned by Doc, Clara, and their two children [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules and Verne Brown|Jules and Verne]]. Doc gives Marty a photo of the two of them by the clockworks in 1885. Jennifer asks about the fax, and Doc tells them it means that the future has not yet been written. Doc and his family depart aboard the locomotive to an unknown time in the past.\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

During filming for the original, director Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time period he would like to see. Fox replied that he wanted to visit the [[American frontier|Old West]] and meet [[cowboy]]s. Zemeckis and writer/producer [[Bob Gale]] were intrigued by the idea, but held it off until ''Part III''.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> Rather than use existing sets, the filmmakers built the 1885 Hill Valley from scratch.<ref name=\"dvdint1\"/> The western scenes were filmed on location in [[Monument Valley]].<ref name=\"DVD(C)\">Back to the Future 2002 DVD Feature: Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale Q&A recorded at the [[University of Southern California]]</ref> Some of the location shooting for the 1885 Hill Valley was done in [[Jamestown, California]], and on a purpose-built set at the Red Hills Ranch near [[Sonora, California]].<ref name=\"DVD(C)\"/> Some of the train scenes were filmed at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railtown1897.org/railtown/doc.asp?id=339 |title=Railtown 1897 State Historic Park Film Credits |website=railtown1897.org|accessdate=October 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203053007/http://www.railtown1897.org/railtown/doc.asp?id=339 |archivedate=December 3, 2010  }}</ref> a [[heritage railroad|heritage line]] in Jamestown.

The most grueling part was editing ''Part II'' while filming ''Part III'', and Zemeckis bore the brunt of the process over a three-week period. While Zemeckis was shooting most of the train sequences in Sonora, Gale was in Los Angeles supervising the final dub of ''Part II''.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Zemeckis would wrap photography and board a private plane to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], where Gale and engineers would greet him on the dubbing stage with dinner. He would oversee the reels completed that day, and make changes where needed.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Afterwards, he would retire to the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Universal Hotel for the night. The following morning, Zemeckis would drive to the [[Burbank Airport]], board a flight back to the set in Northern California, and continue to shoot the film.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\nAlthough the schedule for most of the personnel involved was grueling, the actors found the remote location for ''Part III'' relaxing, compared to shooting its predecessor.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/>\n\nThe role of Clara Clayton was written with Mary Steenburgen in mind.

The film was directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], and stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Thomas F. Wilson]] and [[Lea Thompson]]. The film continues immediately following ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' (1989); while stranded in 1955 during his [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] adventures, [[Marty McFly]] (Fox) discovers that his friend [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] (Lloyd), trapped in 1885, was killed by [[Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen]] (Wilson), [[Biff Tannen|Biff]]'s great-grandfather. Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with [[Clara Clayton]] (Steenburgen).\n\n''Back to the Future Part III'' was filmed in [[California]] and [[Arizona]], and was produced on a $40 million budget [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]] with ''Part II''. ''Part III'' was released in the United States on May 25, 1990, six months after the previous installment, and grossed earned $244 million worldwide during its initial run, making it the [[1990 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 1990]].{{Citation needed lead|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\nOn November 12, 1955, moments after witnessing Doc vanish with the DeLorean from a lightning bolt, [[Marty McFly]] (from 1985) learns that [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett Brown]] (also from 1985) was transported to 1885 and is trapped.{{refn|group=N|As depicted at the end of the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''.}} Marty and the 1955 Doc use the information in Doc's 1885 letter to find and repair the [[DMC DeLorean|DeLorean]] so that Marty can return to 1985, and instructs Marty to not come back for him. Marty spots a tombstone with Doc's name, dated six days after the letter, and learns that Doc was killed by [[Biff Tannen]]'s great-grandfather, Buford. Marty photographs the tombstone and travels to 1885 to save Doc.\n\nMarty arrives on September 2, 1885, in the middle of a [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry]] pursuit of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. When the DeLorean's fuel line is torn, Marty hides the car in a cave and walks to [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]]. He meets his Irish-born great-great-grandparents, [[Maggie McFly#Seamus and Maggie McFly|Seamus and Maggie McFly]], and runs afoul of Buford and his gang. Buford attempts to [[Lynching|lynch]] Marty, but Doc rescues him. Doc agrees to leave 1885 after seeing the photograph, but without gasoline, the DeLorean cannot reach {{convert|88|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nDoc devises a plan to use a train [[locomotive]] to push the DeLorean up to the required speed. While he and Marty explore a [[Branch line|rail spur]] they intend to use, they spot a runaway horse-drawn wagon. Doc saves the passenger, [[Clara Clayton]], and the two fall in love. At a town festival, Buford tries killing Doc, but Marty thwarts him. Buford insults Marty and challenges him to a showdown in two days; in his anger, Marty accepts. Doc warns Marty not to get provoked by name calling and lets it slip that Marty gets into a car accident in the future. Doc's name in the photograph of the tombstone is erased but the date and tombstone itself still remain.\n\nMarty and Doc place the DeLorean onto the spur. Doc makes Marty promise that once he returns to 1985 the DeLorean will be destroyed, but Marty convinces Doc to leave with him. Unable to convince Clara that he is from the future, Doc is spurned. He goes to the saloon for a [[Binge drinking|binge]]. Doc drinks a single shot of whiskey and passes out. Buford arrives and calls out Marty, but Marty observes \"[[Clint Eastwood]]\" (his 1885 alias) appear on the tombstone in the photograph, so refuses to duel. Doc awakens after drinking the bartender's special [[Prairie oyster|\"Wake-Up Juice\"]] and tries fleeing with Marty, but Buford's gang captures Doc, forcing Marty to duel. After fooling Buford into thinking he has killed Marty using a bulletproof plate, Marty knocks Buford into a wagon full of manure. Buford is arrested for an earlier robbery.\n\nAs Clara leaves on the train, she overhears a salesman discussing how heartbroken Doc was. Clara applies the [[Emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] and returns to town. She discovers Doc's model of the time machine and rides after him. Stealing the locomotive at gunpoint, Doc and Marty begin pushing the DeLorean along the spur line. Clara boards the locomotive while Doc climbs toward the DeLorean. Doc encourages Clara to join him, but she falls, hanging precariously by her dress. Marty passes his [[hoverboard]] to Doc so he can save Clara. They coast away from the locomotive as it falls off an unfinished railroad bridge; Marty travels to 1985 on the completed bridge.\n\nMarty arrives on October 27, 1985, escaping the powerless DeLorean before it is destroyed by an oncoming train. He discovers that everything has returned to the initial post-time travel timeline, and finds Jennifer sleeping on her front porch. He uses the lessons he learned in 1885 to avoid being goaded into a street race with Douglas J. Needles, avoiding a possible automobile accident. Remembering that this accident would have sent Marty's life spiraling downward, Jennifer opens a fax message she kept from 2015, and watches as its text regarding Marty's firing disappears.\n\nAs Marty and Jennifer examine the DeLorean wreckage, a flying steam locomotive equipped with a [[DeLorean time machine#flux capacitor|flux capacitor]] appears, manned by Doc, Clara, and their two children [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules and Verne Brown|Jules and Verne]]. Doc gives Marty a photo of the two of them by the clockworks in 1885. Jennifer asks about the fax, and Doc tells them it means that the future has not yet been written. Doc and his family depart aboard the locomotive to an unknown time in the past.\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J.

During filming for the original, director Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time period he would like to see. Fox replied that he wanted to visit the [[American frontier|Old West]] and meet [[cowboy]]s.

The most grueling part was editing ''Part II'' while filming ''Part III'', and Zemeckis bore the brunt of the process over a three-week period. While Zemeckis was shooting most of the train sequences in Sonora, Gale was in Los Angeles supervising the final dub of ''Part II''.<ref name=\"dvdint2\"/> Zemeckis would wrap photography and board a private plane to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], where Gale and engineers would greet him on the dubbing stage with dinner.

SkylArk''''' (1976\u20131977) is a children's cartoon series produced by [[Bob Godfrey]]'s Movie Emporium.\n\n==Introduction==\n''Noah and Nelly'' was created by [[Grange Calveley]], writer of the earlier and better known ''[[Roobarb]]'' cartoon. The five-minute films depict a world loosely based around Noah's Ark. However, Calveley's surreal interpretation involves two-headed talking animals reminiscent of the ''[[pushmi-pullyu]]'' known to ''[[Doctor Dolittle]]''. Each animal has a cheerful, optimistic head at one end and an unhappy, pessimistic head at the other. Even the SkylArk itself is a longship with a figurehead at either end, one smiling, the other frowning. Although there is only one animal of each type, they are referred to in the plural - Brian the lions and Rose the Elephants. As with the earlier ''Roobarb'', the main narration is provided by British actor [[Richard Briers]]. However, co-narrator [[Peter Hawkins]] manages to find a different and appropriate voice for each of the many animals.\n\n==Story==\nThe story follows roughly the same pattern each episode. Captain Nutty Noah consults his map and randomly picks out a place to visit. The SkylArk is then shown travelling to its destination by balloon, on wheels, underwater with snorkelling figureheads or occasionally even by sea. On arriving at their destination, the SkylArk's crew find various strange inhabitants such as talking television sets who are suffering some kind of problem they can't solve themselves (for example, the television sets are stuck showing the news over and over again and getting bored). The animals often help in some way, but the day is invariably saved by Noah's wife Nelly, who uses her knitting skills to create machines which solve the problem in some way. Nelly knits everything from drilling rigs to crash helmets; her supply of wool seems almost inexhaustible but she occasionally has to unravel the ship's sails when she runs out.\n\n==Production==\n{{Original research section|date=February 2019}}\nThe illustration style used in ''Noah and Nelly'' appears to have developed from the style used for ''Roobarb'', but cel animation is used where ''Roobarb'' had marker drawings. Although this technique is arguably more polished, it does not create the same degree of \"boiling\" (i.e., deliberate misalignment of successive frames of animation) that was used to such innovative effect in the earlier series. Producer [[Bob Godfrey]] seems to have deliberately gone back to a more rough and ready style for his third cartoon series ''[[Henry's Cat]]'', which was also better known than ''Noah and Nelly''. It seems that more mainstream production techniques may have led to ''Noah and Nelly's'' ending up less famous than its siblings, in spite of its unique storyline and witty script. Equally, however, it could simply be down to the fact that ''Noah and Nelly'' was not repeated anywhere near as frequently as its stablemates; its final repeat run (which only covered selected episodes, not the full 26) was in 1980, a mere four years after it began, and it has not been shown on British television since. By contrast, both ''Roobarb'' and ''Henry's Cat'' were repeated into the 1990s and beyond.\n\n==Episodes==\n*During a Savings Week\n*During the Time We Were Here\n*During Tea\n*During a Long Time Ago\n*During a Stay at Reservoir Desert\n*During Something and Nothing\n*During a Smashing Time\n*During a Very Damp Spell\n*During a Steam Up\n*During a Flower Show\n*During a Wail of a Time\n*During a Sweep Stake\n*During a Very Funny Day\n*During a Stay at Clockword Canyon\n*During Lunch\n*During a Splashing Time\n*During a Frame Up\n*During a Reading Lesson\n*During a String of Events\n*During a Very High Flight\n*During a Jumpy Time\n*During a Journey Abroad\n*During a Fishing Holiday\n*During a Seasonal Time\n*During a Wild Day\n*During One Afternoon\n*During a Quiet Time\n\n==VHS releases==\nThe series was released on VHS in the mid 1990s under the names of Noah and nelly in the skylark volume 1\nand Noah and nelly in the skylark volume 2.

After working at [[Big Huge Games]], [[Raven Software]] and [[BioWare]], Heir co-founded his own studio, Brass Lion Entertainment, in 2017. Heir is known to be outspoken on issues related to [[race and video games|diversity in video games]]. Heir is also well known for advocating for the white people to be killed.\n\n==Career==\nHeir grew up in Maryland and attended college at [[Virginia Tech]], graduating in 2004 with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.<ref name=\"dice bio\"/><ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He interned at [[Big Huge Games]] around 2005<ref name=\"dice bio\"/> before moving to [[Raven Software]], at the time a subsidiary of [[Activision]]. At Raven, he worked for about four and a half years on the 2009 ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' game, initially as a gameplay programmer before moving to be a game designer for the title.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He had been named as lead designer on another unannounced product, prior to a period of financial difficulty at Raven that resulted in Activision ordering multiple layoffs and cancellation of the unannounced project for the studio to focus on support for the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> Heir, while still employed there, was disappointed in Activision's decision to take away any work on new [[intellectual property]] and offload it to [[Bungie]], and decided to quit the company.<ref name=\"heir twitter 2019\"/> Heir subsequently moved to [[BioWare|BioWare Montreal]] around 2010, where he worked as a gameplay designer on ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (2012) and ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"engadget\"/>\n\nHeir stated that, during development of ''Andromeda'', he and other colleagues from the development team attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to convince the project leads to remove a perceived [[Colonialism|colonialist]] slant to the player's forcible colonization of alien planets.<ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\" /> Heir became the subject of harassment by the [[Gamergate movement]] shortly before the release of ''Andromeda'' in 2017, after they claimed that parts of the game, such as the appearances of female characters, forced a \"liberal agenda\" on players.<ref name=\"mic\"/> An online petition was started to try to have Heir fired from BioWare, though BioWare backed Heir.<ref name=\"mic\"/> However, after the development was completed but before ''Andromeda'' shipped, Heir made the willing choice to leave BioWare, citing that he had become weary over the last twelve years and experiencing [[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch time]], and grown tired of being told to keep quiet over his concerns about games, as well as being put off by the attitudes from the Gamergate movement.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\"/>\n\n===Brass Lion Entertainment===\nAfter leaving BioWare, Heir spent some months considering his career direction, including the possibility of leaving the video game area altogether. After reflection, he felt empowered to establish a new game development studio to focus on games relating to race and diversity based on his own experiences. He reached out to Bryna Dabby Smith, a former production crew member from [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Activision]] with work on games such as ''[[Sleeping Dogs (video game)|Sleeping Dogs]]'', about assisting with the business side of this studio. Word that Heir was establishing a new studio reached Rashad Redic, a game world designer with [[Bethesda Game Studios]] with work in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4]]'', who expressed interest in supporting the two.<ref name=\"gi\"/> The three co-founded Brass Lion Entertainment in 2017 after establishing the vision of this studio over phone calls.<ref name=\"vb\"/> Heir had wanted to call the studio Big Mouth Games, reflecting his outspokenness, but found this conflicted with the program ''[[Big Mouth (TV series)|Big Mouth]]'' on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"engadget\"/> Because of the studio vision on diversity, they wanted to be more inclusive in their hiring practices, bringing in minorities and others from underrepresented backgrounds.<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Corner Wolves}}The studio remained quiet over the first two years as they worked out their first title. Heir formally announced the studio in November 2019 along with their first game, ''Corner Wolves'', an action role-playing game set in the 1990s in [[Harlem]] with the protagonist Jacinte as a young [[Afro-Latin Americans|afro-latino]] that is caught in the midst of the [[War on drugs|drug war]] while she searches for her father's killer.<ref name=\"gi\"/> Race is planned to play a major role in the game, with different non-player characters reacting differently to Jacinte. The game is also envisioned to have short jobs like the ''[[Shenmue]]'' series though the types of jobs available will depend on player choice and their relationships with other characters.<ref name=\"engadget\"/> The game's release will be preceded by a narrative podcast to establish Jacinte's story, being developed by Loud Speakers Network and Marginal Mediaworks.<ref name=\"gi podcast\"/>\n\n==Views on diversity in video games==\nHeir has been outspoken on the need for video games to present better diversity of characters when it comes to race, gender, and other cultural alignments. Heir has said his views are not about achieving [[affirmative action]] within the video game industry, but believes better stories and gameplay can be had by considering underrepresented minorities as main characters, moving away from the typical \"male power fantasy\" that many video games present.<ref name=\"gamasutra interview 2011\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra gdc 2010\"/>\n\nOne of his more recognized statements on diversity was given at the 2014 [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC) in his talk \"Misogyny, Racism and Homophobia: Where Do Video Games Stand?\" where he challenged game developers to include more minority representation in video games, including women and LGBTQ, despite the fears the industry has had to focus games on these types of characters.<ref name=\"gdc 2014\"/> He started the talk that showed the top 25 games of 2013 all had male, Caucasians as the protagonist, and identified games, such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' where while there may be underrepresented minorities, they frequently were treated as objects of ridicule. Heir struck down past claims that games featuring underrepresented minorities sold fewer than those featuring male and Caucasian characters. He argued that failure to include such characters could perpetuate misogyny and racism to youth, and because video games are built on fantasy rather than realism, developers are free to further inclusion of underrepresented minorities without pressure.

After working at [[Big Huge Games]], [[Raven Software]] and [[BioWare]], Heir co-founded his own studio, Brass Lion Entertainment, in 2017. Heir is known to be outspoken on issues related to [[race and video games|diversity in video games]].\n\n==Career==\nHeir grew up in Maryland and attended college at [[Virginia Tech]], graduating in 2004 with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics.<ref name=\"dice bio\"/><ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He interned at [[Big Huge Games]] around 2005<ref name=\"dice bio\"/> before moving to [[Raven Software]], at the time a subsidiary of [[Activision]]. At Raven, he worked for about four and a half years on the 2009 ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'' game, initially as a gameplay programmer before moving to be a game designer for the title.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> He had been named as lead designer on another unannounced product, prior to a period of financial difficulty at Raven that resulted in Activision ordering multiple layoffs and cancellation of the unannounced project for the studio to focus on support for the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' series.<ref name=\"unseen64 interview\"/> Heir, while still employed there, was disappointed in Activision's decision to take away any work on new [[intellectual property]] and offload it to [[Bungie]], and decided to quit the company.<ref name=\"heir twitter 2019\"/> Heir subsequently moved to [[BioWare|BioWare Montreal]] around 2010, where he worked as a gameplay designer on ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (2012) and ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"engadget\"/>\n\nHeir stated that, during development of ''Andromeda'', he and other colleagues from the development team attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to convince the project leads to remove a perceived [[Colonialism|colonialist]] slant to the player's forcible colonization of alien planets.<ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\" /> Heir became the subject of harassment by the [[Gamergate movement]] shortly before the release of ''Andromeda'' in 2017, after they claimed that parts of the game, such as the appearances of female characters, forced a \"liberal agenda\" on players.<ref name=\"mic\"/> An online petition was started to try to have Heir fired from BioWare, though BioWare backed Heir.<ref name=\"mic\"/> However, after the development was completed but before ''Andromeda'' shipped, Heir made the willing choice to leave BioWare, citing that he had become weary over the last twelve years and experiencing [[Crunch time (video gaming)|crunch time]], and grown tired of being told to keep quiet over his concerns about games, as well as being put off by the attitudes from the Gamergate movement.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra heir 2017\"/>\n\n===Brass Lion Entertainment===\nAfter leaving BioWare, Heir spent some months considering his career direction, including the possibility of leaving the video game area altogether. After reflection, he felt empowered to establish a new game development studio to focus on games relating to race and diversity based on his own experiences. He reached out to Bryna Dabby Smith, a former production crew member from [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Activision]] with work on games such as ''[[Sleeping Dogs (video game)|Sleeping Dogs]]'', about assisting with the business side of this studio. Word that Heir was establishing a new studio reached Rashad Redic, a game world designer with [[Bethesda Game Studios]] with work in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4]]'', who expressed interest in supporting the two.<ref name=\"gi\"/> The three co-founded Brass Lion Entertainment in 2017 after establishing the vision of this studio over phone calls.<ref name=\"vb\"/> Heir had wanted to call the studio Big Mouth Games, reflecting his outspokenness, but found this conflicted with the program ''[[Big Mouth (TV series)|Big Mouth]]'' on [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"engadget\"/> Because of the studio vision on diversity, they wanted to be more inclusive in their hiring practices, bringing in minorities and others from underrepresented backgrounds.<ref name=\"gi\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Corner Wolves}}The studio remained quiet over the first two years as they worked out their first title. Heir formally announced the studio in November 2019 along with their first game, ''Corner Wolves'', an action role-playing game set in the 1990s in [[Harlem]] with the protagonist Jacinte as a young [[Afro-Latin Americans|afro-latino]] that is caught in the midst of the [[War on drugs|drug war]] while she searches for her father's killer.<ref name=\"gi\"/> Race is planned to play a major role in the game, with different non-player characters reacting differently to Jacinte. The game is also envisioned to have short jobs like the ''[[Shenmue]]'' series though the types of jobs available will depend on player choice and their relationships with other characters.<ref name=\"engadget\"/> The game's release will be preceded by a narrative podcast to establish Jacinte's story, being developed by Loud Speakers Network and Marginal Mediaworks.<ref name=\"gi podcast\"/>\n\n==Views on diversity in video games==\nHeir has been outspoken on the need for video games to present better diversity of characters when it comes to race, gender, and other cultural alignments. Heir has said his views are not about achieving [[affirmative action]] within the video game industry, but believes better stories and gameplay can be had by considering underrepresented minorities as main characters, moving away from the typical \"male power fantasy\" that many video games present.<ref name=\"gamasutra interview 2011\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra gdc 2010\"/>\n\nOne of his more recognized statements on diversity was given at the 2014 [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC) in his talk \"Misogyny, Racism and Homophobia: Where Do Video Games Stand?\" where he challenged game developers to include more minority representation in video games, including women and LGBTQ, despite the fears the industry has had to focus games on these types of characters.<ref name=\"gdc 2014\"/> He started the talk that showed the top 25 games of 2013 all had male, Caucasians as the protagonist, and identified games, such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' where while there may be underrepresented minorities, they frequently were treated as objects of ridicule. Heir struck down past claims that games featuring underrepresented minorities sold fewer than those featuring male and Caucasian characters. He argued that failure to include such characters could perpetuate misogyny and racism to youth, and because video games are built on fantasy rather than realism, developers are free to further inclusion of underrepresented minorities without pressure. In his talk, Heir pointed to ''[[Assassin's Creed III: Liberation]]'' and ''[[Papers, Please]]'' as games that effectively dealt with race and culture.<ref name=\"poly gdc 2014\"/><ref name=\"guardian gdc 2014\"/> Heir's speech was well-received and considered one of the most important talks given at that year's GDC,<ref name=\"pcgamer gdc 2014\"/> and ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' named Heir one of the top 50 people in the video game industry in 2014 for his talk.<ref name=\"poly top50 2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"dice bio\">{{cite web | url = https://www.dicesummit.org/dice_speakers/details.asp?idSpeaker=184 | title = Manveer Heir - Lead Designer - DICE Summit | accessdate = February 13, 2020 | publisher = [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"engadget\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2020/02/12/brass-lion-entertainment-corner-wolves-interview/ | title = The making of a diverse game studio | first= Chris | last= Ip | date = February 12, 2020 | accessdate= February 12, 2020 | work = [[Engadget]] }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"gamasutra gdc 2010\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/120558/InDepth_No_Female_Heroes_At_Activision.php | title=  In-Depth: No Female Heroes At Activision?
