It was said that during this year a group of nomadic [[Manobo]] from the frontiers of [[Agusan del Norte|Agusan]] found an ideal place for their tempora-fishing retreat and rendezvous.\n\nSoon, the village of ''Tortosa'' was founded by two Christian pioneers, Innocentes Paler and Marcelo Dalaguida, who were later on joined by Luis Gupana and a handful of [[Manobo]]. Credited with a name to the village were a group of natives and [[Spaniards]] who visited the place to trade with the villagers and found the place to be abundant with the sea tortoise.\n\nThe fame of Tortosa as a good fishing was heard by the people of the neighboring [[Butuan City|Butuan]]. Thus a fresh wave migrants came to settle.\n\nLater, Tortosa was renamed to ''Kihaw-an'' in memory of a [[White stag|white deer]] held sacred by the early inhabitants. It was said that this deer was found dead by the natives near the bank of the river which encircles the village. Its carcass was placed all over the village thus the village got the name Kihaw-an, a derivative of a local dialect \"Baho-an\", which literally mean \"to smell\", or \"source of bad smell\".\n\nSoon the village got another new name. It was said that Adolfo Calo, a native of [[Butuan City|Butuan]], together with some natives and [[Spaniards]] visited the place. They expanded their visits not only the coastal areas where flourishing because of the abundance of fish.\nAt the top of the hill they saw the village overlooking the sea. They appreciated the beauty of nature in abundance. They exclaimed \"Bien Vista\", which means \"Good View\" thus the present name ''Buenavista''.\n\nEnticed by the abundance of fish and the good prospect for agriculture, a new wave migrants from the neighboring areas continued to flock to Buenavista. Between the years 1897-1907, settlers and their families were known to have settled in the place.\n\nThe only means of transportation was by ''banca'' or fishing boats, and by horseback trudging the small mountain trails. It was only sometime in the 1920s when Buenavista was connected to [[Butuan City|Butuan]] by means of road. It was also given power by the Marcon Electric Company of the Marcon family but later on, operation was taken over by the government-owned electric distribution facility.\n\nEfforts of the pioneers paid off, because sometime in early 1920s, Buenavista was declared a regular barrio of the then Municipality of [[Butuan City|Butuan]].

It was said that during this year a group of nomadic [[Manobo]] from the frontiers of [[Agusan del Norte|Agusan]] found an ideal place for their tempora-fishing retreat and rendezvous.\n\nSoon, the village of ''Tortosa'' was founded by two Christian pioneers, Innocentes Paler and Marcelo Dalaguida, who were later on joined by Luis Gupana and a handful of [[Manobo]]. Credited with a name to the village were a group of natives and [[Spaniards]] who visited the place to trade with the villagers and found the place to be abundant with the sea tortoise.\n\nThe fame of Tortosa as a good fishing was heard by the people of the neighboring [[Butuan City|Butuan]]. Thus a fresh wave migrants came to settle.\n\nLater, Tortosa was renamed to ''Kihaw-an'' in memory of a [[White stag|white deer]] held sacred by the early inhabitants. It was said that this deer was found dead by the natives near the bank of the river which encircles the village. Its carcass was placed all over the village thus the village got the name Kihaw-an, a derivative of a local dialect \"Baho-an\", which literally mean \"to smell\", or \"source of bad smell\".\n\nSoon the village got another new name. It was said that Adolfo Calo, a native of [[Butuan City|Butuan]], together with some natives and [[Spaniards]] visited the place. They expanded their visits not only the coastal areas where flourishing because of the abundance of fish.\nAt the top of the hill they saw the village overlooking the sea. They appreciated the beauty of nature in abundance. They exclaimed \"Bien Vista\", which means \"Good View\" thus the present name ''Buenavista''.\n\nEnticed by the abundance of fish and the good prospect for agriculture, a new wave migrants from the neighboring areas continued to flock to Buenavista. Between the years 1897-1907, settlers and their families were known to have settled in the place.\n\nThe only means of transportation was by ''banca'' or fishing boats, and by horseback trudging the small mountain trails. It was only sometime in the 1920s when Buenavista was connected to [[Butuan City|Butuan]] by means of road. It was also given power by the Marcon Electric Company of the Marcon family but later on, operation was taken over by the government-owned electric distribution facility.\n\nEfforts of the pioneers paid off, because sometime in early 1920s, Buenavista was declared a regular barrio of the then Municipality of [[Butuan City|Butuan]]. As a barrio, Buenavista was able to form its own law-making body which was locally called ''Ang Tingug Sa Lungsod'', whose members were known as ''podientes''.\n\n\"Municipality of Buenavista\"<ref name=\"GovPH-EO65\">{{cite web|title=Executive Order No. 65; Organizing the Barrio of Buenavista, Together With the Sitios Belonging To the Said Barrio, Municipality of Butuan, Agusan, Into an Independent Municipality, Under the Name of Buenavista, With the Seat of Government in the Barrio of Buenavista|url=http://www.gov.ph/1936/11/19/executive-order-no-65-s-1936/|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=27 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011130400/http://www.gov.ph/1936/11/19/executive-order-no-65-s-1936/|archivedate=11 October 2016|location=Malaca\u00f1an, Manila, Philippines|date=19 November 1936}}</ref> through the efforts of [[1st National Assembly of the Philippines|Assemblyman]] Apolonio D.

In classical antiquity, it was located in [[Corduene]] (''Kardu''). In 19th century scholarship, it was often named as the location of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s crossing of the Tigris in 331 BC, and was identified with the Roman stronghold of '''Bethzabde''' ({{lang-syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0719\u0712\u0715\u071d}}, ''{{transl|syr|B\u0113\u1e6f Za\u1e07dai}}''). However, modern scholarship rejects this - James Crow notes: \"It was formerly thought that Bezabde stood close to modern [[Cizre]], on the west bank of the [[Tigris]]. However archaeological survey has located a major Late Roman site at Eski Hendek, 13 km (8 miles) north-west of Cizre. The outline of the city is trapezoidal and was aligned above the river. It may be seen to be divided into two distinct enclosures, with an annexe to the west and clear traces of projecting towers and multiple defences\".{{sfn|Crow|2018a|page=235}}\n\nBethzabde was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]. The chronicler Msiha Zkha speaks of three bishops of Beth Zabdai in the 2nd and 3rd centuries: Merza, Soubha-liso, and Sabtha.<ref>G. Levenq, v.

VIII, Paris 1935, coll. 1241-1244</ref> In 360 Bishop Theodorus was deported by the Persians, along with the general population, and died as a result of the forced march. Another bishop, Maras, was one of the Fathers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 and in 458 was one of the signatories of the letter of the bishops of Mesopotamia to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] after the death of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1003-1004</ref><ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;437</ref>\n\nIn the late 4th or early 5th century Beth Zabdai or Jezira became a [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] bishopric, known as [[Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Zabdai]] (later Gazarta d'Beth Zabdai). On entering into communion with [[Holy See|Rome]], it became the eparchy of [[Gazarta (Chaldean Diocese)|Gazarta]] of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. In 639 it became the seat also of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and in 1863 the eparchy [[Gazarta (Chaldean Diocese)|Gazarta]] of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]]. These Christians were severely reduced in the 1915 [[Seyfo massacres]] and the structures were allowed to lapse or were incorporated into other jurisdictions. Bethzabda is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]],<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 849</ref> but has not been assigned to any bishop.\n\nIn medieval Islamic tradition, Cizre is the location of ''Thamanin'', the town founded by [[Noah]] at the foot of [[Mount Judi]] where [[Noah's Ark]] came to rest, and a \"tomb of Noah\" as well as a \"tomb of [[Mem and Zin]]\" can be visited in Cizre. [[Al-Masudi]] (d. 956) reports that the spot where the ark landed could still be seen in his time. [[Benjamin of Tudela]] in the 12th century adds that [[Umar|\u02bfUmar ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b]] had made the remnants of the ark into a mosque.\n\n===Early modern===\nIn the 19th century, it was the site of a Kurdish rebellion against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite news|title=Turkey and its Kurds: Dreams of self-rule|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21643200-dance-kurds-seeking-autonomy-government-wanting-support-dreams-self-rule|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=The Economist|date=14 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nCizre was home to an [[Armenians|Armenian]] community of about 3,000. However, in late June 1915, during the [[Armenian Genocide]], the Armenian males, along with a few Syriac bishops, were arrested, tortured, and subsequently murdered.

In classical antiquity, it was located in [[Corduene]] (''Kardu''). In 19th century scholarship, it was often named as the location of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s crossing of the Tigris in 331 BC, and was identified with the Roman stronghold of '''Bethzabde''' ({{lang-syr|\u0712\u071d\u072c \u0719\u0712\u0715\u071d}}, ''{{transl|syr|B\u0113\u1e6f Za\u1e07dai}}''). However, modern scholarship rejects this - James Crow notes: \"It was formerly thought that Bezabde stood close to modern [[Cizre]], on the west bank of the [[Tigris]]. However archaeological survey has located a major Late Roman site at Eski Hendek, 13 km (8 miles) north-west of Cizre. The outline of the city is trapezoidal and was aligned above the river. It may be seen to be divided into two distinct enclosures, with an annexe to the west and clear traces of projecting towers and multiple defences\".{{sfn|Crow|2018a|page=235}}\n\nBethzabde was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]]. The chronicler Msiha Zkha speaks of three bishops of Beth Zabdai in the 2nd and 3rd centuries: Merza, Soubha-liso, and Sabtha.<ref>G. Levenq, v.

VIII, Paris 1935, coll. 1241-1244</ref> In 360 Bishop Theodorus was deported by the Persians, along with the general population, and died as a result of the forced march. Another bishop, Maras, was one of the Fathers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 and in 458 was one of the signatories of the letter of the bishops of Mesopotamia to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] after the death of [[Proterius of Alexandria]].<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 1003-1004</ref><ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;437</ref>\n\nIn the late 4th or early 5th century Beth Zabdai or Jezira became a [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] bishopric, known as [[Nisibis (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Zabdai]] (later Gazarta d'Beth Zabdai). On entering into communion with [[Holy See|Rome]], it became the eparchy of [[Gazarta (Chaldean Diocese)|Gazarta]] of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. In 639 it became the seat also of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and in 1863 the eparchy [[Gazarta (Chaldean Diocese)|Gazarta]] of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]]. These Christians were severely reduced in the 1915 [[Seyfo massacres]] and the structures were allowed to lapse or were incorporated into other jurisdictions. Bethzabda is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]],<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 849</ref> but has not been assigned to any bishop.\n\nIn medieval Islamic tradition, Cizre is the location of ''Thamanin'', the town founded by [[Noah]] at the foot of [[Mount Judi]] where [[Noah's Ark]] came to rest, and a \"tomb of Noah\" as well as a \"tomb of [[Mem and Zin]]\" can be visited in Cizre. [[Al-Masudi]] (d. 956) reports that the spot where the ark landed could still be seen in his time. [[Benjamin of Tudela]] in the 12th century adds that [[Umar|\u02bfUmar ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b]] had made the remnants of the ark into a mosque.\n\n===Early modern===\nIn the 19th century, it was the site of a Kurdish rebellion against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite news|title=Turkey and its Kurds: Dreams of self-rule|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21643200-dance-kurds-seeking-autonomy-government-wanting-support-dreams-self-rule|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=The Economist|date=14 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nCizre was home to an [[Armenians|Armenian]] community of about 3,000. However, in late June 1915, during the [[Armenian Genocide]], the Armenian males, along with a few Syriac bishops, were arrested, tortured, and subsequently murdered.

Odumegwu Ojukwu]], causing much tension.{{sfn|Jowett|2016|p=16}} By contrast, the British historian Philip Baxter called the 4th Commando Brigade as the \"best unit in the [Biafran] army\" and under Steiner's leadership \"well commanded and tactically sound\" on the operational level.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=49-50}}\n\nThe 3rd Nigerian Division had the lines just beyond [[Onitsha]], which the Nigerians had taken in March 1968.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=450}} On 15 November 1968 Steiner ordered [[Operation Hiroshima]] with the aim of retaking Onitsha and stopping the Nigerian advance.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=450}} Baxter wrote that Steiner \"ordered a surprisingly ill-conceived full frontal assault against Nigerian positions across an open area without artillery, air or fire support\".{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=450-451}} Adekunle had his men dug-in with fortified machine gun posts and the Nigerians decisively stopped the Biafran offensive.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} The Belgian mercenary Marc Goosens was killed together with most of his men in a suicidal attack against well dug Nigerian position.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} By the time the offensive was abandoned on 29 November 1968, over half of the 4th Commando Brigade had been killed.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} After the failure of Operation Hiroshima, Steiner lapsed into a depressive state, becoming paranoid as he feared that his own men were planning to kill him while drinking heavily.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} In an assessment, the British journalist [[Frederick Forsyth]] wrote of Steiner: \"He was good once, but deteriorated.

Nine-tenths of the people went naked. They lived like animals. The women didn't even have pots to cook in. Instead the men hammered bits of sheet metal into usable shapes\".{{sfn|Nyeko-Jones|2011|p=75-76}} By August 1969, Steiner was associated with General [[Emilio Tafeng]] and was encouraging his ambitions to make himself leader of Anyanya.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}} In the same month, Steiner planted a story in the Ugandan newspapers that a revolution had brought down the Nile Provisional Government and the people were rallying to Tafeng.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}}  Steiner began to train Tafeng's men at his base in Morta and in 1969 led a \"daring attack\" on the Sudanese Army post at [[Kajo Keji]], which in ended in disaster as the small arms fire of the guerrillas was no match for the heavy machine machines and mortars of the Sudanese.{{sfn| Poggo|2008|p=162}}\n\nIn November 1969, he definitely attached himself to the faction led by General [[Emilio Tafeng]] who was serving as a military adviser to.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Tafeng gave him the rank of colonel together the command of a force that is estimated to have numbered between 20,000-24, 000 men.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The Anyanya rebels were inclined to factionalism, and by 1969 Tafeng had broken away from the main faction to form the Anyidi Revolutionary Government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The split was in part caused by Steiner who promised Tafeng \"that if he could keep away from the Nile Provisional Government...the German government had agreed to supply him with arms so that he could fight separately against the Arabs\".{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}} Steiner suggested that Tafeng that he should overthrow President Gordon Muortat of Nile Provisional Government and once Tafeng was in charge should in turn appoint him chief of staff of Anyanya.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}}  \u00a0\n\nSteiner suggested to Tafeng that arms could be smuggled into the Sudan via Uganda under the guise of humanitarian aid, saying it would be easy to hide arms and ammunition in among the blankets, medical supplies and agricultural implements.{{sfn| Poggo|2008|p=162}} The commander of the Ugandan Army, [[Idi Amin]], tolerated the arms smuggling provided that he received sufficient bribes.{{sfn| Poggo|2008|p=162}} After his defeat at Kajo-Kaji, Steiner went to West Germany where he contacted a Catholic charity, the Biafra-Sudan Action Committee, in an attempt to raise awareness in the West about the plight of the southern Sudanese.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=162}} Upon his return to Sudan, Tafeng gave him a bodyguard of about 800 men, believing that Steiner would deliver upon his promises of aid.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=162}} An American documentary filmmaker Allan Reed found Steiner in 1970 and recalled: \"He wanted to be king. We found him sitting on the ground in this little hut, and he was patching up some infected wounds that some kids had, there was a whole long line of them. He said the only time he was ever happy was when he went into battle. His eyes lit up when he talked about it. He told me that he thinks of himself as a 17th century man. It seemed to me that he was there building himself a little kingdom\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93}} \n\nReed stated that Steiner claimed to him that he was working for MI6 and the Central Intelligence Agency, but Reed was skeptical of these claims, saying: \"He didn't deliver any goods. Any major Western intelligence agency could at least get him some machine guns or munitions...It was really quite strange. It was quite a pathetic looking place\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93-94}} The locals told Reed that the previous year Steiner had ordered them to build an air field, saying that \"plane loads of arms and relief aid\" from the West would then be flown in.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Of the airfield that had been built in 1969, Reed stated: \"So the people chopped down the trees and built a grass runway. It was completely overrun with weeds. The people said that no planes had ever come\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Steiner was noted for his eccentric training and leadership methods such as firing his gun at the feet of sentries he caught sleeping at night, making recruits ride leap swings through fires, and making trainees sit in a circle with their feet facing a mortar tube while he fired a round.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} The people of the southern Sudan remembered Steiner as a strange and terrifying character, but he believed he was acting in their best interest, telling one journalist in 1970: \"I'm an extremist. The Africans need my help\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Martell wrote about Steiner: \"He was addicted to the trill of combat-or at least least to bask in the reputation of that. Coupled with a love of guns and an arrogant political naivety that he could make a change, it was a dangerous mix\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}}\n\nIn late 1969-early 1970, there was heavy fighting as the new Sudanese president [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] ordered an offensive to retake southern Sudan.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} Under the impact of the offensive, Anyidi Revolutionary Government collapsed in April 1970.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The Anyidi Revolutionary Government was cornered between forces of the Nile Provisional Government and another faction loyal to [[Joseph Lagu]] who like Tafeng wanted to overthrow Muortat.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=80}} Tafeng made a bargain where he disbanded his government and recognized the authority of Lagu, who was hostile towards Steiner.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=80}} After a lull in the spring, the fighting resumed and in September-October 1970 several Anyanya camps were taken by the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} Among the camps captured were Tafeng's camp at Morta where Steiner had been based.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} By this point, Steiner was wandering around Southern Sudan aimlessly as the main Anyanya leaders distrusted him.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}}  The British historian [[Edgar O'Ballance]] wrote: \"Steiner had hardly made any impression in the south, which in general seemed embarrassed by his former presence there...\"..{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} \n\nEventually he quarreled with Colonel [[Joseph Lagu]], an Anyanya leader, and was ordered by Lagu to leave the Sudan. Israel was backing the rebellion of the black southern Sudanese against the Arab northerners, and the Israelis had singled out Lagu as the most able of the south Sudanese rebel leaders.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The Israelis felt that Steiner was a \"loose cannon\" and objected to a man who spent his youth in the Nazi ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]''.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}}  One former Israeli agent told Martell: \"I told Lagu, either Steiner leaves or we get out\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} In November 1970, Steiner returned to Uganda and was immediately arrested.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Deciding to return to Europe, Steiner stopped in Kampala, Uganda and unwittingly became involved in the power struggle between Amin and President [[Milton Obote]]. When he refused to implicate his benefactor Amin in treason, Obote had him arrested and flown to Khartoum on January 8, 1971, charged with \"crimes against Africa.\"<ref name=2Sudans/><ref name=Birth/> On 18 January 1971, Steiner appeared at a press conference in Khartoum, where he admitted that he worked as a mercenary, but denied having fought for Anyanya, saying he only served the Anyidi Revolutionary Government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Steiner gave his own assessment of the Anyanya guerrillas, saying they fought well against each other, but less well against the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He described Anyanya as riven by factionalism, personality conflicts and an inability to co-ordinate the political and military aspects of the war.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He also stated Anyanya had much difficulty overcoming ethnic conflicts as the guerrillas disliked fighting outside of their home regions and that he prepared several ambushes of the Sudanese that failed when one or more of the \"resistance platoons\" failed to co-ordinate or even to show up at all.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}}\n\nSteiner's trial in Khartoum between 5 August-9 September 1971 attracted international publicity, not the least because of Steiner's tendency to gave rambling speeches before the court and to make bizarre claims.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76-77}} The Arab government in Khartoum always maintained that the blacks of south Sudan had no grievances, and the rebellion was merely the work of outsiders stirring the southerners up, so putting a mercenary on trial was a great propaganda coup \u00a0for the Nimeiry regime.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}}  He spent three years in prison, where he was severely tortured, and was eventually sentenced to death by the Sudanese courts, which was commuted to twenty years on \"humanitarian\" grounds.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The same Israeli agent expressed regret that he had pressured Lagu to expel Steiner, saying: \"If I had known he would had been tortured like this, I would not had let it happen. What is the point to torture this person? He did nothing bad\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} It was only through pressure from the West German government that he was finally released from prison.\n\n==Later Life==\nSteiner retired to Germany where he remarried and wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1976 as ''The Last Adventurer''.<ref name=\"Steiner 1978\">{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Rolf Steiner, with the collaboration of Yves-Guy Berges ; translated by Steve Cox |title=The last adventurer|date=1978|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297773634}}</ref> In 1976, the East German documentary ''Immer wenn der Steiner kam'' featuring interviews with Steiner in Khartoum prison was released. \n\nForysth has admitted the character of Kurt Semmler in his 1974 novel ''The Dogs of War'', a crazed German mercenary who dies in the Sudan, was based on Steiner.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93}} In an interview with the British journalist Peter Martell, Steiner called ''The Last Adventurer'' a \"fable\" written by his ghost writer  Yves-Guy Berges.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=290}} In the same interview, Steiner denied being a mercenary, saying: \"I was no mercenary.

Long Live War!\"{{sfn|Venter|2006|p=335-336}} One of Steiner's former colleagues called him \"a self-appointed Messiah\" who in his own mind was fighting for the oppressed peoples of Africa, nothing that Steiner liked to denounce the other mercenaries who fought only for money as the \"scum of the earth\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=92}} Martell wrote about him: \"Too wild to conform to the rigid authority of a a formal army, he found comfort in violence, and meaning in the adrenaline of battle and the regularity of uniform\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=92}} \u00a0\n\nIn August 1968, the 4th Commando Brigade was involved in extremely heavy fighting as it attempted to stop the 3rd Nigerian Marine Commando Division under the command of General [[Benjamin Adekunle]] from crossing the Imo Drive as the Nigerians followed up their capture of Port Harcourt, the center of the oil industry.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} By this stage, the 4th Commando Brigade was down to only 1, 000 men, some of whom had to capture ammunition on the battlefield to arm themselves.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}}\n\nThe Indian historian Pradeep Baru wrote the 4th Commando Brigade under Steiner's leadership had a \"poor operational record\" and by late 1968, several Biafran officers felt that Steiner was more of a liability than an asset for Biafra.{{sfn|Barua|2013|p=18}} The British historian Philip Jowett wrote the operations under Steiner's command were \"extremely costly\" as the 4th Commando Brigade took very heavy losses.{{sfn|Jowett|2016|p=15}} Jowett also wrote that Steiner was over-confident and became \"delusional\" in his self-assessment of his abilities.{{sfn|Jowett|2016|p=16}} Most notably he felt that he need not take orders from the staff of the Biafran president [[C. Odumegwu Ojukwu]], causing much tension.{{sfn|Jowett|2016|p=16}} By contrast, the British historian Philip Baxter called the 4th Commando Brigade as the \"best unit in the [Biafran] army\" and under Steiner's leadership \"well commanded and tactically sound\" on the operational level.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=49-50}}\n\nThe 3rd Nigerian Division had the lines just beyond [[Onitsha]], which the Nigerians had taken in March 1968.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=450}} On 15 November 1968 Steiner ordered [[Operation Hiroshima]] with the aim of retaking Onitsha and stopping the Nigerian advance.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=450}} Baxter wrote that Steiner \"ordered a surprisingly ill-conceived full frontal assault against Nigerian positions across an open area without artillery, air or fire support\".{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=450-451}} Adekunle had his men dug-in with fortified machine gun posts and the Nigerians decisively stopped the Biafran offensive.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} The Belgian mercenary Marc Goosens was killed together with most of his men in a suicidal attack against well dug Nigerian position.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} By the time the offensive was abandoned on 29 November 1968, over half of the 4th Commando Brigade had been killed.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} After the failure of Operation Hiroshima, Steiner lapsed into a depressive state, becoming paranoid as he feared that his own men were planning to kill him while drinking heavily.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} In an assessment, the British journalist [[Frederick Forsyth]] wrote of Steiner: \"He was good once, but deteriorated. The press publicity got to him and that's always bad for a mercenary\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=92-93}} \n\nOn 6 December 1968, Steiner was ordered to present himself before Ojukwu and explain his failure.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} Steiner showed up very drunk and belligerent.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} He ordered a glass of beer and become extremely angry when he found the beer was warm, smashing his glass and saying he deserved cold beer.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} When Ojukwu refused, Steiner attempted to slap him across the face, leading to a brawl with Ojukwu's bodyguards.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} Only Ojukwu saved Steiner from being shot on the spot, and the meeting ended with Ojukwu stripping him of command and Steiner being marched out in handcuffs.{{sfn|Baxter|2014|p=451}} Following several confrontations with his Biafran colleagues, Steiner resigned from service, was then arrested, and expelled from the country in handcuffs.<ref name=\"Baxter 2014\">{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Peter|title=Biafra The Nigerian Civil War 1967-1970.|date=2014|publisher=Helion & Co Ltd|isbn=9781909982369|pages=49\u201351}}</ref> On 10 December 1968, Steiner was expelled from Biafra.{{sfn|Jowett|2016|p=16}} On 15 December 1968, Maurice Delauney, the French ambassador to Gabon, reported to Paris: \"After departure of Rolf Steiner and his comrades, there are only three European combatants with the Biafrans, two French and one English\".<ref name=\"Arseneault\">{{cite news |last1=Arseneault |first1=Michel |title=How France armed Biafra's bid to break from Nigeria |url=http://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20170525-how-france-armed-biafras-bid-break-nigeria |accessdate=11 April 2020 |publisher=Radio France International |date=25 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chinua Achebe]], Steiner worked for the Biafrans pro bono.<ref name=Was/>  He was rewarded with Biafran citizenship. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Sudan==\nFollowing his return to Europe, he learned through his contacts in charitable foundations of the plight of Christians in southern Sudan. He offered his services to [[Idi Amin]], then commander of the Ugandan Army,  who was funding the [[Anyanya]] rebel forces, and was dispatched to the war zone.<ref name=Shaping/> Steiner arrived in the Sudan (modern [[South Sudan]]) in July 1969, where he supervised the building of an airfield to fly in arms.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Steiner described southern Sudan as a place where the people were almost living in the Stone Age, writing the people had nothing: \"not even the most ordinary objects which seem to have invaded the plant-not a plastic bucket, a box of matches, a nylon shirt, or even a bottle of Coca-Cola. Nine-tenths of the people went naked. They lived like animals. The women didn't even have pots to cook in. Instead the men hammered bits of sheet metal into usable shapes\".{{sfn|Nyeko-Jones|2011|p=75-76}} By August 1969, Steiner was associated with General [[Emilio Tafeng]] and was encouraging his ambitions to make himself leader of Anyanya.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}} In the same month, Steiner planted a story in the Ugandan newspapers that a revolution had brought down the Nile Provisional Government and the people were rallying to Tafeng.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}}  Steiner began to train Tafeng's men at his base in Morta and in 1969 led a \"daring attack\" on the Sudanese Army post at [[Kajo Keji]], which in ended in disaster as the small arms fire of the guerrillas was no match for the heavy machine machines and mortars of the Sudanese.{{sfn| Poggo|2008|p=162}}\n\nIn November 1969, he definitely attached himself to the faction led by General [[Emilio Tafeng]] who was serving as a military adviser to.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Tafeng gave him the rank of colonel together the command of a force that is estimated to have numbered between 20,000-24, 000 men.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The Anyanya rebels were inclined to factionalism, and by 1969 Tafeng had broken away from the main faction to form the Anyidi Revolutionary Government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The split was in part caused by Steiner who promised Tafeng \"that if he could keep away from the Nile Provisional Government...the German government had agreed to supply him with arms so that he could fight separately against the Arabs\".{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}} Steiner suggested that Tafeng that he should overthrow President Gordon Muortat of Nile Provisional Government and once Tafeng was in charge should in turn appoint him chief of staff of Anyanya.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=127}}  \u00a0\n\nSteiner suggested to Tafeng that arms could be smuggled into the Sudan via Uganda under the guise of humanitarian aid, saying it would be easy to hide arms and ammunition in among the blankets, medical supplies and agricultural implements.{{sfn| Poggo|2008|p=162}} The commander of the Ugandan Army, [[Idi Amin]], tolerated the arms smuggling provided that he received sufficient bribes.{{sfn| Poggo|2008|p=162}} After his defeat at Kajo-Kaji, Steiner went to West Germany where he contacted a Catholic charity, the Biafra-Sudan Action Committee, in an attempt to raise awareness in the West about the plight of the southern Sudanese.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=162}} Upon his return to Sudan, Tafeng gave him a bodyguard of about 800 men, believing that Steiner would deliver upon his promises of aid.{{sfn|Poggo|2008|p=162}} An American documentary filmmaker Allan Reed found Steiner in 1970 and recalled: \"He wanted to be king. We found him sitting on the ground in this little hut, and he was patching up some infected wounds that some kids had, there was a whole long line of them. He said the only time he was ever happy was when he went into battle. His eyes lit up when he talked about it. He told me that he thinks of himself as a 17th century man. It seemed to me that he was there building himself a little kingdom\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93}} \n\nReed stated that Steiner claimed to him that he was working for MI6 and the Central Intelligence Agency, but Reed was skeptical of these claims, saying: \"He didn't deliver any goods. Any major Western intelligence agency could at least get him some machine guns or munitions...It was really quite strange. It was quite a pathetic looking place\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93-94}} The locals told Reed that the previous year Steiner had ordered them to build an air field, saying that \"plane loads of arms and relief aid\" from the West would then be flown in.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Of the airfield that had been built in 1969, Reed stated: \"So the people chopped down the trees and built a grass runway. It was completely overrun with weeds. The people said that no planes had ever come\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Steiner was noted for his eccentric training and leadership methods such as firing his gun at the feet of sentries he caught sleeping at night, making recruits ride leap swings through fires, and making trainees sit in a circle with their feet facing a mortar tube while he fired a round.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} The people of the southern Sudan remembered Steiner as a strange and terrifying character, but he believed he was acting in their best interest, telling one journalist in 1970: \"I'm an extremist. The Africans need my help\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}} Martell wrote about Steiner: \"He was addicted to the trill of combat-or at least least to bask in the reputation of that. Coupled with a love of guns and an arrogant political naivety that he could make a change, it was a dangerous mix\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=94}}\n\nIn late 1969-early 1970, there was heavy fighting as the new Sudanese president [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] ordered an offensive to retake southern Sudan.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} Under the impact of the offensive, Anyidi Revolutionary Government collapsed in April 1970.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} The Anyidi Revolutionary Government was cornered between forces of the Nile Provisional Government and another faction loyal to [[Joseph Lagu]] who like Tafeng wanted to overthrow Muortat.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=80}} Tafeng made a bargain where he disbanded his government and recognized the authority of Lagu, who was hostile towards Steiner.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=80}} After a lull in the spring, the fighting resumed and in September-October 1970 several Anyanya camps were taken by the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} Among the camps captured were Tafeng's camp at Morta where Steiner had been based.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=229}} By this point, Steiner was wandering around Southern Sudan aimlessly as the main Anyanya leaders distrusted him.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}}  The British historian [[Edgar O'Ballance]] wrote: \"Steiner had hardly made any impression in the south, which in general seemed embarrassed by his former presence there...\"..{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} \n\nEventually he quarreled with Colonel [[Joseph Lagu]], an Anyanya leader, and was ordered by Lagu to leave the Sudan. Israel was backing the rebellion of the black southern Sudanese against the Arab northerners, and the Israelis had singled out Lagu as the most able of the south Sudanese rebel leaders.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The Israelis felt that Steiner was a \"loose cannon\" and objected to a man who spent his youth in the Nazi ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]''.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}}  One former Israeli agent told Martell: \"I told Lagu, either Steiner leaves or we get out\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} In November 1970, Steiner returned to Uganda and was immediately arrested.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Deciding to return to Europe, Steiner stopped in Kampala, Uganda and unwittingly became involved in the power struggle between Amin and President [[Milton Obote]]. When he refused to implicate his benefactor Amin in treason, Obote had him arrested and flown to Khartoum on January 8, 1971, charged with \"crimes against Africa.\"<ref name=2Sudans/><ref name=Birth/> On 18 January 1971, Steiner appeared at a press conference in Khartoum, where he admitted that he worked as a mercenary, but denied having fought for Anyanya, saying he only served the Anyidi Revolutionary Government.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76}} Steiner gave his own assessment of the Anyanya guerrillas, saying they fought well against each other, but less well against the Sudanese Army.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He described Anyanya as riven by factionalism, personality conflicts and an inability to co-ordinate the political and military aspects of the war.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}} He also stated Anyanya had much difficulty overcoming ethnic conflicts as the guerrillas disliked fighting outside of their home regions and that he prepared several ambushes of the Sudanese that failed when one or more of the \"resistance platoons\" failed to co-ordinate or even to show up at all.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=77}}\n\nSteiner's trial in Khartoum between 5 August-9 September 1971 attracted international publicity, not the least because of Steiner's tendency to gave rambling speeches before the court and to make bizarre claims.{{sfn|O'Ballance|2003|p=76-77}} The Arab government in Khartoum always maintained that the blacks of south Sudan had no grievances, and the rebellion was merely the work of outsiders stirring the southerners up, so putting a mercenary on trial was a great propaganda coup \u00a0for the Nimeiry regime.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}}  He spent three years in prison, where he was severely tortured, and was eventually sentenced to death by the Sudanese courts, which was commuted to twenty years on \"humanitarian\" grounds.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} The same Israeli agent expressed regret that he had pressured Lagu to expel Steiner, saying: \"If I had known he would had been tortured like this, I would not had let it happen. What is the point to torture this person? He did nothing bad\".{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=95}} It was only through pressure from the West German government that he was finally released from prison.\n\n==Later Life==\nSteiner retired to Germany where he remarried and wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1976 as ''The Last Adventurer''.<ref name=\"Steiner 1978\">{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=Rolf Steiner, with the collaboration of Yves-Guy Berges ; translated by Steve Cox |title=The last adventurer|date=1978|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297773634}}</ref> In 1976, the East German documentary ''Immer wenn der Steiner kam'' featuring interviews with Steiner in Khartoum prison was released. \n\nForysth has admitted the character of Kurt Semmler in his 1974 novel ''The Dogs of War'', a crazed German mercenary who dies in the Sudan, was based on Steiner.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=93}} In an interview with the British journalist Peter Martell, Steiner called ''The Last Adventurer'' a \"fable\" written by his ghost writer  Yves-Guy Berges.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=290}} In the same interview, Steiner denied being a mercenary, saying: \"I was no mercenary.

He uses an online app to rent a girlfriend named Chizuru Mizuhara, a beautiful and attractive girl. However, because she appears to be too perfect, he writes her a low rating, but then Chizuru berates him for that and reveals she is meaner than he expected. However, when Kazuya's grandmother collapses in the hospital, he brings her along and the grandmother is smitten with how great she is.  Kazuya continues renting Chizuru in order to keep up appearances with his family and friends, but things get complicated when they discover they are next-door apartment neighbors and attend the same college. Later, other girls from the girlfriend business also join in dating and showing interest in Kazuya.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Kazuya Kinoshita|\u6728\u30ce\u4e0b \u548c\u4e5f|Kinoshita Kazuya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jun Fukushima]] (2017 commercial),<ref name=\"reiji-tweet\">{{cite web |last1=Miyajima |first1=Reiji |title=\u6628\u65e5\u591c\u3088\u308aYouTube\u306b\u3066\u300c\u5f7c\u5973\u3001\u304a\u501f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059\u300dTVCM\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u307e\u3059\uff01CV\u306f\u306a\u3093\u3068  \u548c\u4e5f:\u798f\u5cf6\u6f64\u3055\u3093 \u5343\u9db4:\u96e8\u5bae\u5929\u3055\u3093  \u3067\u3059\uff01  \u81ea\u5206\u304c\u300c\u3053\u306e\u3059\u3070\u300d\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3060\u3068\u4f1d\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3053\u3093\u306a\u5922\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306b\u2026\uff01\uff01\u662f\u975e\u3054\u89a7\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff01 |url=https://twitter.com/miyajimareiji/status/924807586909642752 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |language=Japanese |date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> [[Haruki Ishiya]] (2018 commercial)<ref name=\"pv2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u300c\u6b4c\u3044\u624b\u306f\u8ab0\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff1f\u300d\uff30\uff36\u6b63\u89e3\u767a\u8868\u3011 \u2193\u524d\u56de\u306e\u4e00\u4eba\u4e8c\u5f79&\u8d85\u65e9\u53e3\u306a\u3001\u6fc0\u30e0\u30ba\uff30\uff36\u2193 |url=https://twitter.com/okarishimasu/status/1010136924059680769 |website=Kanojo, Okarishimasu official Twitter account |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |language=Japanese |date=June 22, 2018}}</ref>, [[Shun Horie]] (anime)<ref name=\"anime-adaptation\"/>}}\n: A college student who, following a painful breakup with his girlfriend Mami, decides to rent a girlfriend.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 1}} He soon finds himself in situations where he has to continue renting Chizuru to keep up appearances with his family and friends.

He uses an online app to rent a girlfriend named Chizuru Mizuhara, a beautiful and attractive girl. However, because she appears to be too perfect, he writes her a low rating, but then Chizuru berates him for that and reveals she is meaner than he expected. However, when Kazuya's grandmother collapses in the hospital, he brings her along and the grandmother is smitten with how great she is.  Kazuya continues renting Chizuru in order to keep up appearances with his family and friends, but things get complicated when they discover they are next-door apartment neighbors and attend the same college. Later, other girls from the girlfriend business also join in dating and showing interest in Kazuya.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Kazuya Kinoshita|\u6728\u30ce\u4e0b \u548c\u4e5f|Kinoshita Kazuya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jun Fukushima]] (2017 commercial),<ref name=\"reiji-tweet\">{{cite web |last1=Miyajima |first1=Reiji |title=\u6628\u65e5\u591c\u3088\u308aYouTube\u306b\u3066\u300c\u5f7c\u5973\u3001\u304a\u501f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059\u300dTVCM\u516c\u958b\u3055\u308c\u3066\u307e\u3059\uff01CV\u306f\u306a\u3093\u3068  \u548c\u4e5f:\u798f\u5cf6\u6f64\u3055\u3093 \u5343\u9db4:\u96e8\u5bae\u5929\u3055\u3093  \u3067\u3059\uff01  \u81ea\u5206\u304c\u300c\u3053\u306e\u3059\u3070\u300d\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u3060\u3068\u4f1d\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3053\u3093\u306a\u5922\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306b\u2026\uff01\uff01\u662f\u975e\u3054\u89a7\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\uff01 |url=https://twitter.com/miyajimareiji/status/924807586909642752 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |language=Japanese |date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> [[Haruki Ishiya]] (2018 commercial)<ref name=\"pv2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u300c\u6b4c\u3044\u624b\u306f\u8ab0\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff1f\u300d\uff30\uff36\u6b63\u89e3\u767a\u8868\u3011 \u2193\u524d\u56de\u306e\u4e00\u4eba\u4e8c\u5f79&\u8d85\u65e9\u53e3\u306a\u3001\u6fc0\u30e0\u30ba\uff30\uff36\u2193 |url=https://twitter.com/okarishimasu/status/1010136924059680769 |website=Kanojo, Okarishimasu official Twitter account |publisher=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |language=Japanese |date=June 22, 2018}}</ref>, [[Shun Horie]] (anime)<ref name=\"anime-adaptation\"/>}}\n: A college student who, following a painful breakup with his girlfriend Mami, decides to rent a girlfriend.{{Ref|Chapter|Ch. 1}} He soon finds himself in situations where he has to continue renting Chizuru to keep up appearances with his family and friends.
