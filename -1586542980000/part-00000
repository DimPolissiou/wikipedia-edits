The V6 powers the XJ6, while the XJ8 was powered by a naturally aspirated V8. The XJR was powered by a supercharged 4.2&nbsp;L V8. The XJ6 and the XJ TDVi are the only X350 models not sold in the Americas.\n\nIn 2005, Jaguar introduced the [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered XJ '''TDVi''', featuring the same Ford-[[Peugeot]]-developed 2.7-litre twin-turbocharged V6 found in the S-Type. The engine, known as the [[Jaguar AJD-V6 engine|AJD-V6]], is rated at {{Convert|204|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|321|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque, and was fitted with electronically controlled active engine mounts to minimise vibration at idle.\n\nBoth X350 and X358 used a six-speed automatic transmission manufactured by [[ZF Friedrichshafen]].\n\nNorth American XJ models were equipped with the {{Convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} naturally aspirated engine or an optional {{Convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[supercharged]] 4.2&nbsp;L V8 engine. The latter engine's valvetrain had a [[dual overhead cam]] design with [[multi-valve|four valves per cylinder]] and its top speed was electronically limited to {{Convert|155|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Trim levels===\nAt introduction, the XJ was marketed worldwide in numerous trim levels, including XJ8, XJ Vanden Plas and XJR in North America, and XJ6, XJ8, XJ Sovereign in the UK. For the 2005 model year, Jaguar introduced a long wheelbase variant of the X350. For 2007, the premium model was the reintroduced as the Jaguar Sovereign when the Super V8 and Daimler versions were dropped.\n\n*'''Daimler Super Eight/Super V8:''' The Super V8, also known as the Daimler Super Eight, was the most expensive model, with the XJR being the second most expensive model in the range. The Super V8, which debuted in the 2003 model year in the new X350 body style, was initially of a short-wheelbase configuration. This became an option in 2004 when a long-wheelbase configuration was introduced, along with the supercharged variation of the XJ8 with the more luxurious Vanden Plas, or Daimler interior. Its primary competitor was the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG]]. A distinctive wire mesh grille and chrome-finished side mirrors set the Super V8 and the XJR apart from the less expensive XJ saloons. In 2005, the Super V8 model was replaced by the Daimler Super Eight in all markets other than North America. The Daimler Super Eight was essentially the same car, but with the addition of a different grille, boxwood inlays finished in wood veneer and several other interior luxuries as standard. Daimler's US equivalent was no longer known as the Vanden Plas, but the Super V8. The Vanden Plas name was used on models that would be known as Sovereign elsewhere. Daimler has been the [[Official state car#British government|State Car]] for the British Prime Minister since the 1980s. Although this was replaced with the Sentinel trim in 2011 when the [[Jaguar XJ (X351)|next generation]] of the XJ was introduced.\n\n*'''Super V8 Portfolio:'''  In early 2005, Jaguar announced the Super V8 Portfolio for the 2006 model year, a limited-edition trim level of the flagship Super V8 saloon. It debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show]] in March 2005 with a base price of [[US$]]115,995. The Portfolio trim level included a [[DVD]] player and 7-inch screens in the rear headrests. The Super V8 Portfolio, marketed in North American markets, became available in August 2005 and was exclusively available in two colors, Black Cherry and Winter Gold. The Super V8 Portfolio was powered by Jaguar's supercharged {{Convert|400|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 4.2&nbsp;L, 32-valve, AJ-V8 engine with a top speed of {{convert|155|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time under 5&nbsp;seconds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=={{anchor|X358}} X358 (2007 facelift)==\n{{Multiple image \n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal \n| width = 200\n|image1= Jaguar XJ 2.7 D (X350, Facelift) \u2013 Frontansicht, 17.

The V6 powers the XJ6, while the XJ8 was powered by a naturally aspirated V8. The XJR was powered by a supercharged 4.2&nbsp;L V8. The XJ6 and the XJ TDVi are the only X350 models not sold in the Americas.\n\nIn 2005, Jaguar introduced the [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered XJ '''TDVi''', featuring the same Ford-[[Peugeot]]-developed 2.7-litre twin-turbocharged V6 found in the S-Type. The engine, known as the [[Jaguar AJD-V6 engine|AJD-V6]], is rated at {{Convert|204|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|321|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque, and was fitted with electronically controlled active engine mounts to minimise vibration at idle.\n\nBoth X350 and X358 used a six-speed automatic transmission manufactured by [[ZF Friedrichshafen]].\n\nNorth American XJ models were equipped with the {{Convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} naturally aspirated engine or an optional {{Convert|400|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} [[supercharged]] 4.2&nbsp;L V8 engine. The latter engine's valvetrain had a [[dual overhead cam]] design with [[multi-valve|four valves per cylinder]] and its top speed was electronically limited to {{Convert|155|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Trim levels===\nAt introduction, the XJ was marketed worldwide in numerous trim levels, including XJ8, XJ Vanden Plas and XJR in North America, and XJ6, XJ8, XJ Sovereign in the UK. For the 2005 model year, Jaguar introduced a long wheelbase variant of the X350. For 2007, the premium model was the reintroduced as the Jaguar Sovereign when the Super V8 and Daimler versions were dropped.\n\n*'''Daimler Super Eight/Super V8:''' The Super V8, also known as the Daimler Super Eight, was the most expensive model, with the XJR being the second most expensive model in the range. The Super V8, which debuted in the 2003 model year in the new X350 body style, was initially of a short-wheelbase configuration. This became an option in 2004 when a long-wheelbase configuration was introduced, along with the supercharged variation of the XJ8 with the more luxurious Vanden Plas, or Daimler interior. Its primary competitor was the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class|Mercedes-Benz S55 AMG]]. A distinctive wire mesh grille and chrome-finished side mirrors set the Super V8 and the XJR apart from the less expensive XJ saloons. In 2005, the Super V8 model was replaced by the Daimler Super Eight in all markets other than North America. The Daimler Super Eight was essentially the same car, but with the addition of a different grille, boxwood inlays finished in wood veneer and several other interior luxuries as standard. Daimler's US equivalent was no longer known as the Vanden Plas, but the Super V8. The Vanden Plas name was used on models that would be known as Sovereign elsewhere. Daimler has been the [[Official state car#British government|State Car]] for the British Prime Minister since the 1980s. Although this was replaced with the Sentinel trim in 2011 when the [[Jaguar XJ (X351)|next generation]] of the XJ was introduced.\n\n*'''Super V8 Portfolio:'''  In early 2005, Jaguar announced the Super V8 Portfolio for the 2006 model year, a limited-edition trim level of the flagship Super V8 saloon. It debuted at the [[New York International Auto Show]] in March 2005 with a base price of [[US$]]115,995. The Portfolio trim level included a [[DVD]] player and 7-inch screens in the rear headrests. The Super V8 Portfolio, marketed in North American markets, became available in August 2005 and was exclusively available in two colors, Black Cherry and Winter Gold. The Super V8 Portfolio was powered by Jaguar's supercharged {{Convert|400|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 4.2&nbsp;L, 32-valve, AJ-V8 engine with a top speed of {{convert|155|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a {{convert|0|to|60|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} acceleration time under 5&nbsp;seconds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=={{anchor|X358}} X358 (2007 facelift)==\n{{Multiple image \n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal \n| width = 200\n|image1= Jaguar XJ 2.7 D (X350, Facelift) \u2013 Frontansicht, 17.
