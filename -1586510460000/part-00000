When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.\n\nThe Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950\u201351 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.\n\nRajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of the [[Telugu language]]\u2014its grammar and script evolved from the pen of the city-born poet [[Nannayya]]. Also known as '\u0100di Kavi' (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrana]], translated the [[Sanskrit]] version of [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu.

When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.\n\nThe Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950\u201351 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.\n\nRajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of the [[Telugu language]]\u2014its grammar and script evolved from the pen of the city-born poet [[Nannayya]]. Also known as '\u0100di Kavi' (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrana]], translated the [[Sanskrit]] version of [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu. Kandukuri Veeresalingam \u2013 a social reformer and the author of Rajashekhara Charithra, the first Telugu novel \u2013 was also from Rajahmundry.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of cities in Andhra Pradesh}}\n\nRajamahendravaram is located at {{Coord|16.98|N|81.78|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/02/Rajahmundry.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Rajamahendravaram, India|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> with an average elevation of {{convert|14|m}}.
