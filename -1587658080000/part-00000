These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brauner  | first1 = Fran\u00e7oise Erna  | authorlink = | title = L'an\u00e9antissement de deux r\u00e9seaux de la r\u00e9sistance | doi = 10.3917/sn.018.0034\n | journal = Sud/Nord | volume = 18  | issue = 1  | pages = 34-48 | year = 2003  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brauner  | first1 = Fran\u00e7oise Erna  | authorlink = | title = L'an\u00e9antissement de deux r\u00e9seaux de la r\u00e9sistance | doi = 10.3917/sn.018.0034\n | journal = Sud/Nord | volume = 18  | issue = 1  | pages = 34-48 | year = 2003  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (OSE) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

He is nicknamed \"The Greaseman\". Allegations of racial insensitivity have repeatedly derailed his career as a radio host.\n\n==Personal==\nTracht was born and grew up in the [[South Bronx]] ([[New York City]]) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran immigrant from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2008-05-18/news/obit_2185570v1d0518_1_alzheimer-s-foundation-enfield-family \"TRACHT, Gertrude 'Trudie'\"] Hartford Courant, May 18, 2008.</ref> Tracht attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at [[Ithaca College]] and landed a job at the college radio station. \"From the first day I got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station ([[WWWS|WYSL]]) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job.\" Tracht got a job at [[WNYY|WTKO]], a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE.<ref name=PENT /> Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972<ref name=ITHACA>{{cite news |work=[[The Ithacan]] |via=digitalcommons.ithaca.edu |date=March 4, 1999 |first=Kevin |last=Rettig |title=Alumnus 'Greaseman' wiped off D.C. airwaves |url=https://digitalcommons.ithaca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=ithacan_1998-99}}</ref>\nand married Marie Massara who was the sales secretary at WENE.<ref>[http://www.greaseman.org/ \"A Greaseman Biography\"] Greaseman website.</ref>\n\n==The name==\nThe Greaseman pseudonym originated while he was in college. \"In those days of top 40, everybody who was on the radio was 'cookin'; cookin' with the Temptations, cookin' Four Tops, that kind of thing. Which meant they were really rockin'. One day I said I was cookin' with heavy grease. It was my way of saying I was out-cookin' the other guys. I said it enough times, so one day one of the other deejays referred to me as the Greaseman.\"<ref name=PENT />\nHis radio name had been ''Dougie T'', but when he became ''the Greaseman'', a different personality surfaced. His voice deepened and he projected the image of a middle-aged tattooed truck driver with a beer belly and a cigar.<ref name=COMEBACK /> In reality, Tracht was 6 foot 2 and 150 pounds. He used the radio as an alter ego; a guy with a swaggering bravado.<ref name=PENT /> At WENE, he was asked to do remote broadcasts from a sponsor's business and listeners were disappointed to see that he looked like a wimp.<ref name=SCHIZO />  In later years, Tracht took up bodybuilding to improve his physique.<ref name=PENT />\n\n==The show==\n\"The Greaseman Show\" is a fast-paced array of what he terms \"bits.\" Calls from listeners inevitably lead to a story of a recurring character from his repertoire, and no topic is taboo. He calls his deep voice his \"basso grosso\" or \"basso profundo.\"<ref name=PENT />\nAs The Greaseman, Tracht invented a clever way of getting around limits on indecent language by using slang terms for body parts and functions that he invented. His listeners knew the meanings of the terms. In this way, he managed to directly discuss very explicitly adult topics without alerting censors, or alarming parents who did not understand the private language.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Early career===\nTracht went through a string of stations including [[WHIC|WAXC]] in [[Rochester, New York]], [[WTEM|WRC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[WPOP]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He lost his job at WPOP when that station switched its format from pop music to all news in 1975. He lost the job at WRC because program director Gordon Peil wanted Tracht to drop the Greaseman personality. The frequent moves from city to city were a major reason for the end of his first marriage, after less than two years.<ref name=SCHIZO /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.98wrc.com/greaseman.htm|title=\"Skip McCloskey Remembers:Greaseman\"}}</ref>\n\n===Success===\nTracht found a home at [[WOKV (AM)|WAPE]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in August 1975 and became the dominant radio personality not just in northeast Florida,<ref name=OFF>Patton, Charlie: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012298/S0122Gon.html \"Greaseman's off local radio dial once again\"] Florida Times-Union, January 22, 1998.</ref> but in the Southeastern United States<ref name=PENT /> While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung in the window of the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.<ref name=SCHIZO />\n\nHe was an early [[shock jock]], but Tracht denies the label: \"I'm telling jokes. The bottom line\u2014it's a comedy show.\"<ref name=PENT /> \"I'm creating characters and stories, I'm weaving a tapestry of humor. The others are just saying nasty things.\"<ref name=SCHIZO />\nHowever, his show was outrageous and edgy, which offended some people. Tracht kept his stories from violating FCC obscenity regulations by using \"code words\" for certain anatomical features (''hydraulics'' for male genitalia, ''fudge packing'' for anal sex, for instance) and sound effects for physical acts.\n\nAllen Moore, WAPE's news director, was also a [[bodybuilder]]. Tracht questioned Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to his thin physique.<ref name=PENT /> After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name=SCHIZO /> Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked the night shift with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then went directly to the station at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform.<ref name=SCHIZO /> One of his most popular bits was stories portraying what it would be like to be a lawman. He would state \"What it must be like to strap on a gun, pin on a badge and become a lawman\" under the theme song to the TV program SWAT.\n\nOn May 25, 1979, Tracht gained national attention when he mocked convicted murderer [[John Spenkelink]], who was due to be executed in \"[[Old Sparky]],\" the [[Florida State Prison]] electric chair, that day. Tracht aired a recording of sizzling bacon and dedicated it to Spenkelink, telling him to get used to the sound.<ref>Michaud S, Aynesworth H (1999): ''The Only Living Witness''. Penguin Putnam, {{ISBN|0-451-16372-9}}, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"Florida Wields Death Law\">{{cite news|title=Florida Wields Death Law|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/55783185/|accessdate=5 January 2014|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|date=26 August 1979}}</ref>\n\nTracht remained in Jacksonville almost seven years, then moved in 1982 to [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC-FM]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he replaced [[Howard Stern]]. DC-101 was his first [[FM broadcast band|FM]] station. He purchased a home in nearby [[Potomac, Maryland]], continued working out, and overcame his dislike of public appearances. During that time, he was known for a series of publicity stunts, including his \"presidential campaign\" in 1984.\n\n===WMATA (DC subway rail service) audio-skit===\n\nOne of his audio-skits was a story of himself as an explorer being chased.  The story was complete with bongos playing in the background with intermittent screeches of wild jungle birds.  The implication was he was being chased by cannibals in the jungle.  The bongo drums became louder and louder as the story progressed, implying those chasing him were getting closer and closer and he was getting more and more desperate to escape.  The story ended just as he was about to be caught when he \"...jumped on the Red Line and went home!\"\n\n===Martin Luther King Day comment===\nIn January 1986, Tracht created an uproar by telling an on-air joke regarding the new federal holiday, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Day]].  Tracht said, \"Why don't we shoot four more and get the whole week off?\" followed by, \"Come on, now, you know I don't mean nothin'!\" He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at [[Howard University]] in honor of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. King]].<ref name=SLIDE /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted that he was the highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.<ref name=SCHIZO>Smith, Gary: [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73859635.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+1987&author=Gary+Smith&desc=I%27m+Almost+A+Trained+Schizo%27 \"I'm Almost A Trained Schizo'\"] Washington Post, November 29, 1987.</ref>\n\n===Syndication===\nHis show was [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] by [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]] for five years, from January 1993 until January 1998. Tracht moved to [[Los Angeles]], where his show originated from a private broadcasting studio in LA, and was carried by stations in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and [[KLOS]] in Los Angeles, among others. During 1994 his audience was estimated at 2.5 million listeners each day.<ref name=PENT>Reifer, Susan: [http://www.greaseman.org/ph_199412.html \"GREASEMAN\"] Penthouse Magazine, December 1994.</ref>\n\nSyndication was not as successful as Infinity had hoped, so the contract was not extended beyond five years. In the last year of his Infinity contract, he was hired by [[WIAD|WARW-FM]] for $1 million per year and returned to Washington, D.C., where he again incorporated music into his show.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===James Byrd comment===\nOn February 24, 1999, after a year at WARW (now [[WIAD]]), Tracht made a comment about [[James Byrd Jr.|James Byrd]], who was murdered in 1998 by being dragged behind a pickup truck by three men, two determined to be [[white supremacists]]. The day before, jurors had convicted John William King of Byrd's murder.<ref>Lyman, Rick: [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/us/texas-jury-picks-death-sentence-in-fatal-dragging-of-a-black-man.html?ref=john_william_king \"Texas Jury Picks Death Sentence In Fatal Dragging of a Black Man\"] New York Times, February 26, 1999.</ref> Tracht had been playing a sound bite of [[Lauryn Hill]] who had ten nominations at the [[41st Grammy Awards]]. Tracht then stated, \"No wonder people drag them behind trucks.\"<ref name=RACIST /> After the comment, he immediately stated that he \"didn't mean nothin'.\" This incident proved catastrophic to his radio career, igniting a firestorm of protest from listeners of all races, including [[Donnie Simpson]], who lambasted Tracht on his morning show on sister station [[WPGC-FM]]. Not only was Tracht quickly [[Firing|fired]] from WARW, but he also lost his position as a volunteer [[deputy sheriff]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].<ref name=RACIST>{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104206/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012|title='Greaseman' Suspended for Racist Remark; WARW Pulls Doug Tracht Off the Air, Offers Apology |newspaper=The Washington Post|date= February 25, 1999}}</ref>\n\n====Apology====\nRock Newman was a black businessman who knew Tracht before the incident. Newman felt that Tracht was truly sorry and accompanied Doug and his wife on a quest to apologize and show that he wasn't a racist.<ref name=IMUS /> The week following his firing, Tracht held a press conference and made an apology to his listeners, \"Every day you deserve my best, and last Wednesday I gave you my worst. This experience, compiled with my past transgressions upon racial and human decency, have forever taught me the value of respect and restraint.\"<ref name=ITHACA /> They spoke to several black organizations, then appeared on ''BET Tonight'' with [[Tavis Smiley]] on [[Black Entertainment Television]] where he faced angry questions. After being confronted by one caller, Tracht begged, \"Let me down off this cross, will you?\"<ref name=SLIDE /> Counseling was recommended. The show asked its audience what Tracht could do, but almost 75 percent said \"nothing.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\n====Penance====\nA worker at [[DC Central Kitchen]] saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard his desire to show he was sorry. She thought that the \"Kitchen\" would be a good place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: \"It's the kind of place where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht began counseling with a psychologist at [[Howard University]]. After the counselor got to know his patient, he stated, \"I saw nothing consistent with what I would expect to find with someone who is a racist.\"<ref name=IMUS /> Tracht continued to see the therapist weekly for over a year.<ref name=SLIDE />\n\nIn February 2000, a station owner in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands]], offered Tracht a DJ job. Tracht intended to make a new start, but when local residents found out about it, they objected. Local politicians talked to the station owner, who was \"persuaded\" to rescind the offer.<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht had a part in the [[Discovery Channel]]'s show ''The FBI Files'' and appeared in an [[infomercial]] for an internet dating site in 2000.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===Later career===\nBy 2002 Tracht returned to the air from his home studio, broadcasting on [[WDMV]] AM 700 (previously WGOP) near [[Frederick, Maryland]], and was soon afterward [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to numerous other stations in the region. He then held the morning-show slot on [[WMET]] AM 1160 in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], until November 2, 2007. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described this period as \"six years of broadcasting his morning show on tiny, unknown AM stations with signals so weak they dissolve under the static created by a car's ignition system.\"<ref name=SLIDE>Fisher, Marc: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112300491.html \"Imus Returning, but Greaseman Can't Stop His Long Slide\"] The Washington Post, November 25, 2007, page M05.</ref><ref name=IMUS>Ahrens, Frank: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-03/09/041r-030900-idx.html \"The Silenced Greaseman\"] The Washington Post, March 9, 2000, page C01.</ref>\n\n[[Marc Fisher]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist, wrote a story in November 2007 that questioned why Tracht hadn't been rehabilitated to the public like other broadcasters: [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Don Imus]], [[Marv Albert]], and [[Opie and Anthony]]. All were suspended for bad behavior, some of which was criminal, but all returned to the microphone. Fisher called Tracht \"the most talented of the shock jocks, a storyteller so verbally nimble, so fantastically imaginative that his showmanship seemed wasted on an audience of adolescent guys.\"<ref name=COMEBACK>Patton, Charlie: [http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/100108/met_338771561.shtml \"Greaseman begins his comeback in city today\"] Florida Times-Union, October 1, 2008.</ref><ref name=SLIDE />\n\nSelected Greaseman bits were heard during late [[Drive time|PM drive]] on WGRX-FM 104.5 in the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], area. On March 31, 2008, [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] announced that the Greaseman show would be returning on Saturday mornings beginning April 5, 2008, and that the run would go until October 2008, after [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] decided to have more \"music intensive\" weekends on DC101.\n\n====Jacksonville again====\nIn January 2008 David Israel, the vice president and general manager of [[Cox Radio]] in Jacksonville, brought back [[Bubba the Love Sponge]], who was fired in 2004 for indecency. When people asked about Tracht, another former Jacksonville radio personality, Israel tracked him down and they began discussing a job in August 2008.<ref name=COMEBACK /> On September 29, 2008, during the Bubba the Love Sponge show, it was announced that Tracht would be returning to [[Jacksonville]] to do the afternoon show.<ref name=COMEBACK /><ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Boyle |title='Greaseman' Returning To DC101 |url=http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3d&Version=0 |work=Radio and Records |accessdate=2008-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926203809/http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3D&Version=0 |archive-date=2008-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This wasn't his first time back since his 1982 departure from WAPE. In the fall of 1996, his show was broadcast via syndication in Jacksonville over [[WXXJ (FM)|WTLK-FM]] \"Real Radio\" 106.5, where it lasted until January 1998, when the station changed owners and formats. On October 1, 2008, the Greaseman began his 3\u20137 p.m. show on [[WOKV-FM|WFYV-FM]].

He is nicknamed \"The Greaseman\".\n\n==Personal==\nTracht was born and grew up in the [[South Bronx]] ([[New York City]]) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran immigrant from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/2008-05-18/news/obit_2185570v1d0518_1_alzheimer-s-foundation-enfield-family \"TRACHT, Gertrude 'Trudie'\"] Hartford Courant, May 18, 2008.</ref> Tracht attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at [[Ithaca College]] and landed a job at the college radio station. \"From the first day I got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station ([[WWWS|WYSL]]) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job.\" Tracht got a job at [[WNYY|WTKO]], a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE.<ref name=PENT /> Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972<ref name=ITHACA>{{cite news |work=[[The Ithacan]] |via=digitalcommons.ithaca.edu |date=March 4, 1999 |first=Kevin |last=Rettig |title=Alumnus 'Greaseman' wiped off D.C. airwaves |url=https://digitalcommons.ithaca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=ithacan_1998-99}}</ref>\nand married Marie Massara who was the sales secretary at WENE.<ref>[http://www.greaseman.org/ \"A Greaseman Biography\"] Greaseman website.</ref>\n\n==The name==\nThe Greaseman pseudonym originated while he was in college. \"In those days of top 40, everybody who was on the radio was 'cookin'; cookin' with the Temptations, cookin' Four Tops, that kind of thing. Which meant they were really rockin'. One day I said I was cookin' with heavy grease. It was my way of saying I was out-cookin' the other guys. I said it enough times, so one day one of the other deejays referred to me as the Greaseman.\"<ref name=PENT />\nHis radio name had been ''Dougie T'', but when he became ''the Greaseman'', a different personality surfaced. His voice deepened and he projected the image of a middle-aged tattooed truck driver with a beer belly and a cigar.<ref name=COMEBACK /> In reality, Tracht was 6 foot 2 and 150 pounds. He used the radio as an alter ego; a guy with a swaggering bravado.<ref name=PENT /> At WENE, he was asked to do remote broadcasts from a sponsor's business and listeners were disappointed to see that he looked like a wimp.<ref name=SCHIZO />  In later years, Tracht took up bodybuilding to improve his physique.<ref name=PENT />\n\n==The show==\n\"The Greaseman Show\" is a fast-paced array of what he terms \"bits.\" Calls from listeners inevitably lead to a story of a recurring character from his repertoire, and no topic is taboo. He calls his deep voice his \"basso grosso\" or \"basso profundo.\"<ref name=PENT />\nAs The Greaseman, Tracht invented a clever way of getting around limits on indecent language by using slang terms for body parts and functions that he invented. His listeners knew the meanings of the terms. In this way, he managed to directly discuss very explicitly adult topics without alerting censors, or alarming parents who did not understand the private language.\n\n== Career ==\n\n===Early career===\nTracht went through a string of stations including [[WHIC|WAXC]] in [[Rochester, New York]], [[WTEM|WRC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[WPOP]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. He lost his job at WPOP when that station switched its format from pop music to all news in 1975. He lost the job at WRC because program director Gordon Peil wanted Tracht to drop the Greaseman personality. The frequent moves from city to city were a major reason for the end of his first marriage, after less than two years.<ref name=SCHIZO /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.98wrc.com/greaseman.htm|title=\"Skip McCloskey Remembers:Greaseman\"}}</ref>\n\n===Success===\nTracht found a home at [[WOKV (AM)|WAPE]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in August 1975 and became the dominant radio personality not just in northeast Florida,<ref name=OFF>Patton, Charlie: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012298/S0122Gon.html \"Greaseman's off local radio dial once again\"] Florida Times-Union, January 22, 1998.</ref> but in the Southeastern United States<ref name=PENT /> While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung in the window of the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.<ref name=SCHIZO />\n\nHe was an early [[shock jock]], but Tracht denies the label: \"I'm telling jokes. The bottom line\u2014it's a comedy show.\"<ref name=PENT /> \"I'm creating characters and stories, I'm weaving a tapestry of humor. The others are just saying nasty things.\"<ref name=SCHIZO />\nHowever, his show was outrageous and edgy, which offended some people. Tracht kept his stories from violating FCC obscenity regulations by using \"code words\" for certain anatomical features (''hydraulics'' for male genitalia, ''fudge packing'' for anal sex, for instance) and sound effects for physical acts.\n\nAllen Moore, WAPE's news director, was also a [[bodybuilder]]. Tracht questioned Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to his thin physique.<ref name=PENT /> After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].<ref name=SCHIZO /> Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked the night shift with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then went directly to the station at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform.<ref name=SCHIZO /> One of his most popular bits was stories portraying what it would be like to be a lawman. He would state \"What it must be like to strap on a gun, pin on a badge and become a lawman\" under the theme song to the TV program SWAT.\n\nOn May 25, 1979, Tracht gained national attention when he mocked convicted murderer [[John Spenkelink]], who was due to be executed in \"[[Old Sparky]],\" the [[Florida State Prison]] electric chair, that day. Tracht aired a recording of sizzling bacon and dedicated it to Spenkelink, telling him to get used to the sound.<ref>Michaud S, Aynesworth H (1999): ''The Only Living Witness''.

DC-101 was his first [[FM broadcast band|FM]] station. He purchased a home in nearby [[Potomac, Maryland]], continued working out, and overcame his dislike of public appearances. During that time, he was known for a series of publicity stunts, including his \"presidential campaign\" in 1984.\n\n===WMATA (DC subway rail service) audio-skit===\n\nOne of his audio-skits was a story of himself as an explorer being chased.  The story was complete with bongos playing in the background with intermittent screeches of wild jungle birds.  The implication was he was being chased by cannibals in the jungle.  The bongo drums became louder and louder as the story progressed, implying those chasing him were getting closer and closer and he was getting more and more desperate to escape.  The story ended just as he was about to be caught when he \"...jumped on the Red Line and went home!\"\n\n===Martin Luther King Day comment===\nIn January 1986, Tracht created an uproar by telling an on-air joke regarding the new federal holiday, [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Day]].  Tracht said, \"Why don't we shoot four more and get the whole week off?\" followed by, \"Come on, now, you know I don't mean nothin'!\" He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at [[Howard University]] in honor of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. King]].<ref name=SLIDE /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted that he was the highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.<ref name=SCHIZO>Smith, Gary: [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73859635.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+1987&author=Gary+Smith&desc=I%27m+Almost+A+Trained+Schizo%27 \"I'm Almost A Trained Schizo'\"] Washington Post, November 29, 1987.</ref>\n\n===Syndication===\nHis show was [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] by [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]] for five years, from January 1993 until January 1998. Tracht moved to [[Los Angeles]], where his show originated from a private broadcasting studio in LA, and was carried by stations in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and [[KLOS]] in Los Angeles, among others. During 1994 his audience was estimated at 2.5 million listeners each day.<ref name=PENT>Reifer, Susan: [http://www.greaseman.org/ph_199412.html \"GREASEMAN\"] Penthouse Magazine, December 1994.</ref>\n\nSyndication was not as successful as Infinity had hoped, so the contract was not extended beyond five years. In the last year of his Infinity contract, he was hired by [[WIAD|WARW-FM]] for $1 million per year and returned to Washington, D.C., where he again incorporated music into his show.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===James Byrd comment===\nOn February 24, 1999, after a year at WARW (now [[WIAD]]), Tracht made a comment about [[James Byrd Jr.|James Byrd]], who was murdered in 1998 by being dragged behind a pickup truck by three men, two determined to be [[white supremacists]]. The day before, jurors had convicted John William King of Byrd's murder.<ref>Lyman, Rick: [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/us/texas-jury-picks-death-sentence-in-fatal-dragging-of-a-black-man.html?ref=john_william_king \"Texas Jury Picks Death Sentence In Fatal Dragging of a Black Man\"] New York Times, February 26, 1999.</ref> Tracht had been playing a sound bite of [[Lauryn Hill]] who had ten nominations at the [[41st Grammy Awards]]. Tracht then stated, \"No wonder people drag them behind trucks.\"<ref name=RACIST /> After the comment, he immediately stated that he \"didn't mean nothin'.\" This incident proved catastrophic to his radio career, igniting a firestorm of protest from listeners of all races, including [[Donnie Simpson]], who lambasted Tracht on his morning show on sister station [[WPGC-FM]]. Not only was Tracht quickly [[Firing|fired]] from WARW, but he also lost his position as a volunteer [[deputy sheriff]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].<ref name=RACIST>{{cite news| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104206/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-571390.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012|title='Greaseman' Suspended for Racist Remark; WARW Pulls Doug Tracht Off the Air, Offers Apology |newspaper=The Washington Post|date= February 25, 1999}}</ref>\n\n====Apology====\nRock Newman was a black businessman who knew Tracht before the incident. Newman felt that Tracht was truly sorry and accompanied Doug and his wife on a quest to apologize and show that he wasn't a racist.<ref name=IMUS /> The week following his firing, Tracht held a press conference and made an apology to his listeners, \"Every day you deserve my best, and last Wednesday I gave you my worst. This experience, compiled with my past transgressions upon racial and human decency, have forever taught me the value of respect and restraint.\"<ref name=ITHACA /> They spoke to several black organizations, then appeared on ''BET Tonight'' with [[Tavis Smiley]] on [[Black Entertainment Television]] where he faced angry questions. After being confronted by one caller, Tracht begged, \"Let me down off this cross, will you?\"<ref name=SLIDE /> Counseling was recommended. The show asked its audience what Tracht could do, but almost 75 percent said \"nothing.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\n====Penance====\nA worker at [[DC Central Kitchen]] saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard his desire to show he was sorry. She thought that the \"Kitchen\" would be a good place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: \"It's the kind of place where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice.\"<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht began counseling with a psychologist at [[Howard University]]. After the counselor got to know his patient, he stated, \"I saw nothing consistent with what I would expect to find with someone who is a racist.\"<ref name=IMUS /> Tracht continued to see the therapist weekly for over a year.<ref name=SLIDE />\n\nIn February 2000, a station owner in [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands]], offered Tracht a DJ job. Tracht intended to make a new start, but when local residents found out about it, they objected. Local politicians talked to the station owner, who was \"persuaded\" to rescind the offer.<ref name=IMUS />\n\nTracht had a part in the [[Discovery Channel]]'s show ''The FBI Files'' and appeared in an [[infomercial]] for an internet dating site in 2000.<ref name=IMUS />\n\n===Later career===\nBy 2002 Tracht returned to the air from his home studio, broadcasting on [[WDMV]] AM 700 (previously WGOP) near [[Frederick, Maryland]], and was soon afterward [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to numerous other stations in the region. He then held the morning-show slot on [[WMET]] AM 1160 in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]], until November 2, 2007. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described this period as \"six years of broadcasting his morning show on tiny, unknown AM stations with signals so weak they dissolve under the static created by a car's ignition system.\"<ref name=SLIDE>Fisher, Marc: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/23/AR2007112300491.html \"Imus Returning, but Greaseman Can't Stop His Long Slide\"] The Washington Post, November 25, 2007, page M05.</ref><ref name=IMUS>Ahrens, Frank: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-03/09/041r-030900-idx.html \"The Silenced Greaseman\"] The Washington Post, March 9, 2000, page C01.</ref>\n\n[[Marc Fisher]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist, wrote a story in November 2007 that questioned why Tracht hadn't been rehabilitated to the public like other broadcasters: [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]], [[Don Imus]], [[Marv Albert]], and [[Opie and Anthony]]. All were suspended for bad behavior, some of which was criminal, but all returned to the microphone.

When people asked about Tracht, another former Jacksonville radio personality, Israel tracked him down and they began discussing a job in August 2008.<ref name=COMEBACK /> On September 29, 2008, during the Bubba the Love Sponge show, it was announced that Tracht would be returning to [[Jacksonville]] to do the afternoon show.<ref name=COMEBACK /><ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Boyle |title='Greaseman' Returning To DC101 |url=http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3d&Version=0 |work=Radio and Records |accessdate=2008-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926203809/http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebSite/NewsStoryPage.aspx?ContentID=jFLtl7QcI2g%3D&Version=0 |archive-date=2008-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This wasn't his first time back since his 1982 departure from WAPE.

On October 1, 2008, the Greaseman began his 3\u20137 p.m. show on [[WOKV-FM|WFYV-FM]].

Introduced for the 2015 model year, this generation of the F-Series is the first aluminum-intensive vehicle produced on a large scale by an American vehicle manufacturer.  For the 2017 model year, the fourth-generation Super Duty line adopted the cab design of the F-150, consolidating the cab design for the first time on Ford light-duty trucks (F-550 and below) for the first time since the 1996 model year; the Super Duty trucks still retain separate bodywork and a higher-GVWR frame.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, a second generation of the [[Ford Raptor]] made its return for 2017 as a high-performance variant of the F-150, dropping the SVT prefix). In Mexico, the F-Series XL trim is marketed as the ''F-150'', XLT and higher trims are named ''Lobo'' (Wolf in Spanish).<ref>https://www.ford.mx/camiones/f150/2019/</ref>  The Mexican-market [[Lincoln Mark LT]] was discontinued completely, replaced by the Limited and Platinum trims sold elsewhere.\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series is produced by Ford in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] ([[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]]) alongside the [[Ford Transit]] van and at [[Dearborn, Michigan]] ([[Ford River Rouge Complex|Dearborn Truck Plant]]).\n\n== Design overview ==\n[[File:Ford F-150 P552 Extended Cab.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|F-150 XLT SuperCab]]\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series was unveiled at the [[2014 North American International Auto Show]] on January 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/naias/index.ssf/2014/01/2015_ford_f-150_makes_world_de.html|title=2015 Ford F-150 makes world debut at Detroit auto show|website=mlive|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>  A number of safety technologies and driver assistance features were introduced as options, including: 360\u00b0 camera, [[Adaptive Cruise Control|adaptive cruise control]], [[Collision Warning with Brake Support|collision warning with brake support]], [[Blind Spot Information System|blind spot information system]] (BLIS) with [[Intersection assistant|cross-traffic alert]], and a [[Lane-Keeping System|lane-keeping system]].\n\nWhile not the first aluminum-bodied vehicle developed by Ford (the company developed 40 aluminum-bodied [[Mercury Sable#Special editions|Mercury Sable]] prototypes in 1993, reducing curb weight by 400 pounds<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140110/BLOG06/140119985/fords-work-with-aluminum-bodied-vehicles-goes-back-decades|title=Ford's work with aluminum-bodied vehicles goes back decades|last=Truett|first=Richard|website=Automotive News|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>), the F-Series was the first Ford aluminum-bodied vehicle to make it to production.<ref name=\":1\" />  While changing the metal composition of the best-selling vehicle in the United States, 85% of the parts of the vehicle were domestically-sourced (as of 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-10.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars #10|publisher=Bankrate.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars|work=[[Kogod School of Business]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820180255/http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|archivedate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the F-150 was equipped with the optional 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine and two-wheel drive, it was able to comply with [[Corporate average fuel economy#Future standards|proposed future CAFE standards]] through 2024 without any modifications.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Winter|first=Drew|date=3 August 2016|title=Survey: CAFE Rules Likely to Get Tougher, Not Easier|url=https://www.wardsauto.com/industry/survey-cafe-rules-likely-get-tougher-not-easier|magazine=Ward's Auto|location=Southfield, Michigan|publisher=Informa USA|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Chassis ===\nWhile nearly all body panels of the F-150 were converted from steel to aluminum construction (the only significant sheetmetal component constructed of steel is the firewall<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1401_2015_ford_f_150_first_look/|title=2015 Ford F-150 First Look|last=Markus|first=Frank|date=2014-01-12|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/12724/|title=2015 F-150: Ford drops an aluminum blockbuster|work=SAE|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>), the frame remained of steel construction, the use of high-strength steel in the frame was increased from 23% to 77%.<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\" />  To showcase the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, Ford entered prototypes of the model disguised as 12th generation F150s in the Baja 1000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/2014-detroit-auto-show/2015-ford-f-150-baja-1000-prototype-ford-snuck-in|title=This is how Ford snuck a 2015 F-150 past everyone at the Baja 1000|website=Road and Track|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Powertrain ===\nThe F-Series underwent a revision of its powertrain offerings, largely to expand its range of both powerful and fuel-efficient engines.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/106/closer-look-new-base-v6-2015-ford-f150|title=A Closer Look at the New Base V6 of the 2015 Ford F150|website=Torque News|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>  As the entry-level V6, a 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine#Duratec 35|Ti-VCT]] V6 replaced the previous 3.7&nbsp;L V6;

unrelated to the larger EcoBoost engine, it is shared with the Ford Fusion and Lincoln Continental.\n\nFor model year 2017, the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost engine underwent a redesign, increasing its output to 375&nbsp;hp (450&nbsp;hp for the Raptor); along with adding supplementary port fuel injection, the engine introduced auto start/stop capability.  For model year 2018, the model line received three all-new engines, as a 3.3&nbsp;L V6 replaced the naturally-aspirated 3.5&nbsp;L V6 and the 2.7&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6 was redesigned (adopting many of the changes from the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost engine).  For the first time, a diesel engine was offered in the F-150, as a 250&nbsp;hp 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Power Stroke engine#3.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V6 was introduced during the model year, dependent on trim (commercial and fleet sales only, for XL and XLT trim).  For 2019, the 450&nbsp;hp version of the 3.5&nbsp;L engine was introduced to the flagship Limited trim.\n\nAs with the previous generation, the F-Series is offered solely with automatic transmissions.  At initial launch, a 6-speed [[Ford 6R transmission#6R80|Ford 6R80]] automatic was paired with all four engines.  As part of the introduction of the 2017 Raptor, a 10-speed [[Ford-GM 10-speed automatic transmission#10R80|Ford 10R80]] automatic (the first 10-speed transmission in a non-commercial vehicle) was paired to its 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6.

While the cab design saw largely evolutionary styling changes, the rectangular grille adopted a trapezoidal shape, flanked by C-shaped headlamp units.  Using [[LED headlights]] for the first time, designers used [[polycarbonate]] [[thermoplastic]] optics to focus the beams, with one LED for each beam and an orange thermoplastic [[Light tube#In electronic devices|light pipe]] (doubling as the turn signal).<ref name=\"Miel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20140114/NEWS/140119968/fords-f-150-gets-new-look-thanks-to-plastics|title=Ford's F-150 gets new look thanks to plastics|author=Miel, Rhoda|date=January 14, 2014|work=Plastics News|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref>  Coupled with the headlamps, the taillamps adopted LED technology, also housing the [[blind spot monitor]]; these systems were not typically included on pickup trucks because the system could not be packaged inside steel bumpers typically found on pickup trucks.<ref name=\"Miel\"/>  The tailgate was redesigned; along with retaining its fold-out step functionality, the tailgate was redesigned, adopting several different styles (dependent on trim).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:'15-'17 Ford F-150 Regular Cab St. Basile Le Grand.jpg|F-150 XL regular cab\nFile:Ford F-150 Quartier Dix30.jpg|F-150 XL SuperCab \nFile:Ford 2015 F-150 Lariat (15734579807).jpg|2015 F-150 Lariat SuperCab \nFile:'15 Ford F-150 Platinum (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '15).jpg|2015 F-150 Platinum \nFile:2016 Ford F-150 Limited Super Crew 3.5L, front 6.29.19.jpg|2016 F-150 Limited SuperCrew\nFile:SLY 5618 (15833027941).jpg|2015-2017 F-150 tailgate \n</gallery>\n\n==== 2018 update ====\nFor 2018, the F-150 underwent a mid-cycle model revision, adopting several design features from the Super Duty model line.  The trapezoidal grille was replaced by an octagonal grille; the three-bar styling was replaced by a wide two-bar configuration (with a larger Ford Blue Oval emblem).  The tailgate saw minor changes, with an embossed \"F-150\" emblem replacing the previous stamped-metal logo; the taillamps saw a minor revision.

Introduced for the 2015 model year, this generation of the F-Series is the first aluminum-intensive vehicle produced on a large scale by an American vehicle manufacturer.  For the 2017 model year, the fourth-generation Super Duty line adopted the cab design of the F-150, consolidating the cab design for the first time on Ford light-duty trucks (F-550 and below) for the first time since the 1996 model year; the Super Duty trucks still retain separate bodywork and a higher-GVWR frame.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, a second generation of the [[Ford Raptor]] made its return for 2017 as a high-performance variant of the F-150, dropping the SVT prefix). In Mexico, the F-Series XL trim is marketed as the ''F-150'', XLT and higher trims are named ''Lobo'' (Wolf in Spanish).<ref>https://www.ford.mx/camiones/f150/2019/</ref>  The Mexican-market [[Lincoln Mark LT]] was discontinued completely, replaced by the Limited and Platinum trims sold elsewhere.\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series is produced by Ford in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] ([[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]]) alongside the [[Ford Transit]] van and at [[Dearborn, Michigan]] ([[Ford River Rouge Complex|Dearborn Truck Plant]]).\n\n== Design overview ==\n[[File:Ford F-150 P552 Extended Cab.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|F-150 XLT SuperCab]]\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series was unveiled at the [[2014 North American International Auto Show]] on January 13, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/naias/index.ssf/2014/01/2015_ford_f-150_makes_world_de.html|title=2015 Ford F-150 makes world debut at Detroit auto show|website=mlive|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>  A number of safety technologies and driver assistance features were introduced as options, including: 360\u00b0 camera, [[Adaptive Cruise Control|adaptive cruise control]], [[Collision Warning with Brake Support|collision warning with brake support]], [[Blind Spot Information System|blind spot information system]] (BLIS) with [[Intersection assistant|cross-traffic alert]], and a [[Lane-Keeping System|lane-keeping system]].\n\nWhile not the first aluminum-bodied vehicle developed by Ford (the company developed 40 aluminum-bodied [[Mercury Sable#Special editions|Mercury Sable]] prototypes in 1993, reducing curb weight by 400 pounds<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140110/BLOG06/140119985/fords-work-with-aluminum-bodied-vehicles-goes-back-decades|title=Ford's work with aluminum-bodied vehicles goes back decades|last=Truett|first=Richard|website=Automotive News|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref>), the F-Series was the first Ford aluminum-bodied vehicle to make it to production.<ref name=\":1\" />  While changing the metal composition of the best-selling vehicle in the United States, 85% of the parts of the vehicle were domestically-sourced (as of 2016).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-10.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars #10|publisher=Bankrate.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|title=The Most American-Made Cars|work=[[Kogod School of Business]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820180255/http://www.bankrate.com/finance/auto/top-cars-patriotic-drivers-1.aspx|archivedate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the F-150 was equipped with the optional 2.7L EcoBoost V6 engine and two-wheel drive, it was able to comply with [[Corporate average fuel economy#Future standards|proposed future CAFE standards]] through 2024 without any modifications.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Winter|first=Drew|date=3 August 2016|title=Survey: CAFE Rules Likely to Get Tougher, Not Easier|url=https://www.wardsauto.com/industry/survey-cafe-rules-likely-get-tougher-not-easier|magazine=Ward's Auto|location=Southfield, Michigan|publisher=Informa USA|access-date=19 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Chassis ===\nWhile nearly all body panels of the F-150 were converted from steel to aluminum construction (the only significant sheetmetal component constructed of steel is the firewall<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/trucks/1401_2015_ford_f_150_first_look/|title=2015 Ford F-150 First Look|last=Markus|first=Frank|date=2014-01-12|publisher=Motor Trend|accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sae.org/12724/|title=2015 F-150: Ford drops an aluminum blockbuster|work=SAE|publisher=SAE International|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>), the frame remained of steel construction, the use of high-strength steel in the frame was increased from 23% to 77%.<ref name=\"motortrend.com2\" />  To showcase the durability of the aluminum-intensive design, Ford entered prototypes of the model disguised as 12th generation F150s in the Baja 1000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-shows/2014-detroit-auto-show/2015-ford-f-150-baja-1000-prototype-ford-snuck-in|title=This is how Ford snuck a 2015 F-150 past everyone at the Baja 1000|website=Road and Track|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Powertrain ===\nThe F-Series underwent a revision of its powertrain offerings, largely to expand its range of both powerful and fuel-efficient engines.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/106/closer-look-new-base-v6-2015-ford-f150|title=A Closer Look at the New Base V6 of the 2015 Ford F150|website=Torque News|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>  As the entry-level V6, a 3.5&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine#Duratec 35|Ti-VCT]] V6 replaced the previous 3.7&nbsp;L V6;

along with adding supplementary port fuel injection, the engine introduced auto start/stop capability.  For model year 2018, the model line received three all-new engines, as a 3.3&nbsp;L V6 replaced the naturally-aspirated 3.5&nbsp;L V6 and the 2.7&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6 was redesigned (adopting many of the changes from the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost engine).

Using [[LED headlights]] for the first time, designers used [[polycarbonate]] [[thermoplastic]] optics to focus the beams, with one LED for each beam and an orange thermoplastic [[Light tube#In electronic devices|light pipe]] (doubling as the turn signal).<ref name=\"Miel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20140114/NEWS/140119968/fords-f-150-gets-new-look-thanks-to-plastics|title=Ford's F-150 gets new look thanks to plastics|author=Miel, Rhoda|date=January 14, 2014|work=Plastics News|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref>  Coupled with the headlamps, the taillamps adopted LED technology, also housing the [[blind spot monitor]]; these systems were not typically included on pickup trucks because the system could not be packaged inside steel bumpers typically found on pickup trucks.<ref name=\"Miel\"/>  The tailgate was redesigned; along with retaining its fold-out step functionality, the tailgate was redesigned, adopting several different styles (dependent on trim).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:'15-'17 Ford F-150 Regular Cab St. Basile Le Grand.jpg|F-150 XL regular cab\nFile:Ford F-150 Quartier Dix30.jpg|F-150 XL SuperCab \nFile:Ford 2015 F-150 Lariat (15734579807).jpg|2015 F-150 Lariat SuperCab \nFile:'15 Ford F-150 Platinum (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '15).jpg|2015 F-150 Platinum \nFile:2016 Ford F-150 Limited Super Crew 3.5L, front 6.29.19.jpg|2016 F-150 Limited SuperCrew\nFile:SLY 5618 (15833027941).jpg|2015-2017 F-150 tailgate \n</gallery>\n\n==== 2018 update ====\nFor 2018, the F-150 underwent a mid-cycle model revision, adopting several design features from the Super Duty model line.  The trapezoidal grille was replaced by an octagonal grille; the three-bar styling was replaced by a wide two-bar configuration (with a larger Ford Blue Oval emblem).  The tailgate saw minor changes, with an embossed \"F-150\" emblem replacing the previous stamped-metal logo; the taillamps saw a minor revision.  Several appearance packages were introduced for the XL, XLT, and Lariat trims.<ref name=\"Ford F-150\" />\n\nTo comply with 2018 [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]], all 2018 F-150 models received a standard rear-view backup camera.<ref name=\"Ford F-150\" />\n\nIn comparison to the exterior, the interior of the 2018 F-150 saw fewer visible changes, with most revisions focused on its [[In-Vehicle Infotainment|infotainment]] systems.  [[Ford Sync|Sync]] was updated to Sync 3; on select models, the system provides remote access, service information, and other vehicle-related information.  The premium audio system manufacturer shifted from Sony to [[Bang & Olufsen]], with [[SiriusXM|SiriusXM satellite radio]] becoming standard for the XLT trim.<ref name=\"Ford F-150\" />\n\nFor 2018, the top-line Limited trim received the powertrain of the Raptor, with a restyled dual exhaust for 2019; the Limited also gained a model-specific Camel Back interior color for 2019.<ref>https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/07/26/2019-f-150-limited-gains-high-output-ecoboost-v6.html</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford F-150 Demix Extended Cab.jpg|F-150 XL SuperCab\nFile:Ford F-150 XLT 3.3 2019 (45621648615).jpg|F-150 XLT regular cab\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 XLT front 5.19.18.jpg|F-150 XLT SuperCab\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 XLT rear 5.19.18.jpg|F-150 XLT SuperCab rear, showing new tailgate\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 au salon internatiinal de l'auto de Montr\u00e9al 2018.jpg|2018 Ford F-150 King Ranch\nFile:2018 Ford F-150 Platinum au SIAM 2018.jpg|2018 F-150 Platinum \nFile:2018 Ford F-150 Limited au SIAM 2018.jpg|2018 F-150 Limited \n</gallery>\n\n==Trim==\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 225\n| image1 = 2018 Ford F-150 Lariat Crew Cab 3.5L EcoBoost front 4.22.19.jpg\n| image2 = 2018 Ford F-150 Lariat Crew Cab 3.5L EcoBoost rear 4.22.19.jpg\n| caption2 = 2018 F-150 Lariat SuperCrew FX4\n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n}}\nFor the 2015 model year, the F-150 model line underwent several revisions, largely to consolidate the number of trim offerings.  Most visibly, the Raptor was withdrawn (put on hiatus until 2017 to complete its development), with the Tremor and Harley-Davidson special editions discontinued.  The STX, FX2, and FX4 were also discontinued as free-standing trim levels; in a revision, the features of the STX reappeared as a stand-alone option package for 2016, with the suspension features of the FX4 becoming an option package on all 4\u00d74 trims (except the Limited and Raptor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/files/15_f150_appearanceguide-hc_sglepg_final_2-ret-.pdf|title=2015 F-150 APPEARANCE GUIDE|publisher=Cars.com|format=PDF|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-generation F-Series follows traditional Ford truck nomenclature with XL, XLT, and Lariat trims; along with the Super Duty line, the F-150 also has premium King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited trims (the Raptor is exclusive to the F-150).\n\n* XL (from 2015) \n* XLT (from 2015) \n* Lariat (from 2015)\n* King Ranch (from 2015) \n* Platinum (from 2015) \n* Limited (from 2016) \n* Raptor (from 2017)\n\n===F-150 Raptor===\n{{Main|Ford Raptor}}\n[[File:Ford F-150 Raptor 3.5T 2019.jpg|thumb|2019 Ford F-150 Raptor]]\nFollowing a two-year hiatus, the F-150 Raptor sub-model made its return for the 2017 model year, with the loss of its previous SVT prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.com/trucks/f150raptor/?fmccmp=lp-future-fut-hp-2017-raptor|title=2017 Ford F-150 Raptor - A Beast Off-Road & On - Ford.com|website=www.ford.com}}</ref> As with its predecessor, the 2017 Raptor is an off-road oriented vehicle produced in SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations with a model-exclusive 5.5-ft pickup bed. The model continues its lack of a Ford Blue Oval grille badge, with \"F-O-R-D\" spelled across the center of the grille.\n\nAs with a standard Ford F-150, the Raptor is an aluminum-intensive vehicle; though built upon a steel frame, nearly all its body panels are built using aluminum (reducing curb weight by nearly {{Convert|500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} over an equivalent 2014 SVT Raptor). In place of the {{Convert|411|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 6.2&nbsp;L V8, the new Raptor features a 3.5&nbsp;L twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 paired with an industry-first 10-speed automatic transmission.

It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman</ref>\n\nBuddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.\n\nBuddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped. They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east. Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.\n\n===Islamic period===\n\n{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]], converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.\n\n[[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], is traditionally credited for this conversion.

Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.\n\nCompared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Q\u0101sim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh\u2014perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.\n\nMiddle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]\u2014widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast\u2014and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal\u2013Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>\n\nThe other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in the Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Maldivans.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], depicting workers]]\n[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by [[Pierre Mortier]] from the [[Netherlands]], depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]\nIn 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'u\u1e93am]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.\n\nThe British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].\n\nIn the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.\n\nMaldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal\u00e9 with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of \u00a3750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name=\"gan.philliptsmall.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Independence and republic===\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sultan of the Maldives.png|thumb|Flag of the [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Sultan of the Maldives]]]]\n\nIn line with the broader British policy of decolonisation, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.\n\nOn 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.\n\n[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives \u2013 Population\". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nPolitical infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export.  With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.\n\n[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name=\"cnn_sinking\">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>\n\nA series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success.

Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.\n\nThe shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November.

The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAs a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. In 2019, Maldives signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.\n\nIn addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"[[Haa Alif]]\" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.  Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>\n\nThe introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name.

In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP. {{As of|2008}}, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/ |title=Ministry of Tourism.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\nThe [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives]]\n\n[[File:Population estimates of Maldives.png|thumb|Demographics of the Maldives, from 2000 to 2012]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\" |Population{{UN_Population|ref}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Census population by Sex and Sex ratio, 1911 \u2013 2014 |url=http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/yearbook/statisticalarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/table2.1.pdf |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics, Maldives.}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Thousands\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1911 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|72\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1966 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|100\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|270\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2019 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|533\n|}\n\nThe largest ethnic group is [[Dhivehis|Dhivehin]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India. They share the same culture and speak the [[Dhivehi language]]. They are principally an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] people, having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and African genes in the population.\n\nIn the past there was also a small [[Tamils|Tamil]] population known as the [[Giraavaru people]]. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.\n\nSome social stratification exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties. Instead of a complex [[caste]] system, there was merely a distinction between noble (b\u0113fulhu) and common people in the Maldives. Members of the social elite are concentrated in Mal\u00e9.\n\nThe population doubled by 1978, and the [[population growth]] rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives's [[cultural heritage]].\n\nOther aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu ([[Mawlid]])\u2014the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone\u2014existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.\n\nAccording to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or [[Mal\u00e9 Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Mal\u00e9. Built in 1656, this is the country's oldest mosque.\n\n===Languages===\n{{main|Maldivian language}}\n\n[[File:Dhivehiscript.svg|thumb|Thaana script]]\n\nThe official and common language is [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] closely related to the [[Sinhala language]] of Sri Lanka. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the ''[[eveyla akuru]]'' script, which is found in historical recording of kings (''raadhavalhi''). Later a script called ''[[dhives akuru]]'' was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]].\n\nEnglish is widely spoken by the locals of the Maldives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maldives.tourism-srilanka.com/travel-tips/language.html|title=Maldives Languages \u2013 Languages of Maldives \u2013 Language Spoken In Maldives|website=maldives.tourism-srilanka.com}}</ref> Following the nation's opening to the outside world, the introduction of English as a medium of instruction at secondary and tertiary level of education, and its government's recognition of the opportunities offered through tourism, English has now firmly established itself in the country.

This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.\n\nReflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.<ref>Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades. In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry. In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services. In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded. The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first degree programme: Bachelor of Arts.

The book was written in AD 1194 (590 AH) in the Ev\u0113la form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the Maldives|Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].]]\n\nDespite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400-year-long Buddhist period has foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman</ref>\n\nBuddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.\n\nBuddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped. They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east. Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.\n\n===Islamic period===\n\n{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]], converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.\n\n[[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], is traditionally credited for this conversion.

Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.\n\nCompared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Q\u0101sim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh\u2014perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.\n\nMiddle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]\u2014widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast\u2014and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal\u2013Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>\n\nThe other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in the Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Maldivans.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], depicting workers]]\n[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by [[Pierre Mortier]] from the [[Netherlands]], depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]\nIn 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'u\u1e93am]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.\n\nThe British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].\n\nIn the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.\n\nMaldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal\u00e9 with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of \u00a3750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name=\"gan.philliptsmall.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Independence and republic===\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sultan of the Maldives.png|thumb|Flag of the [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Sultan of the Maldives]]]]\n\nIn line with the broader British policy of decolonisation, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.\n\nOn 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.\n\n[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives \u2013 Population\". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nPolitical infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export.  With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.\n\n[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name=\"cnn_sinking\">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>\n\nA series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Mal\u00e9]] restored order.\n\nA November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman.

It lies between latitudes [[1st parallel south|1\u00b0S]] and [[8th parallel north|8\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian east|72\u00b0]] and [[74th meridian east|74\u00b0E]]. The atolls are composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, situated atop a submarine ridge {{convert|960|km}} long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.\n\nOnly near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]]. The largest island of Maldives is that of [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]], which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In [[Addu Atoll]], the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road) and the total length of the road is {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nMaldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only {{convert|2.4|m}} and {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres.

Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.\n\nThe shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maldives \u2013 Atlapedia

The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAs a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. In 2019, Maldives signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations.\n\n===Human rights===\n{{main|Human rights in the Maldives}}\nHuman rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.\n\nIn addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"[[Haa Alif]]\" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.  Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>\n\nThe introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name.

The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as [[coir]] rope, [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi) with neighboring countries and [[East Asian]] countries.\n\nThe Maldivian government began a largely successful [[economic reform]] programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At the time [[tourism]] sector which would play a significant role in the nation's development was at its infant stage.\n\nAgriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives|List of mosques in the Maldives}}\n\n[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue fresh lagoons]]\n\nThe Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s.

Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.\n\nThe development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup?

In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\nThe [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives]]\n\n[[File:Population estimates of Maldives.png|thumb|Demographics of the Maldives, from 2000 to 2012]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\" |Population{{UN_Population|ref}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Census population by Sex and Sex ratio, 1911 \u2013 2014 |url=http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/yearbook/statisticalarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/table2.1.pdf |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics, Maldives.}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Thousands\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1911 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|72\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1966 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|100\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|270\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2019 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|533\n|}\n\nThe largest ethnic group is [[Dhivehis|Dhivehin]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India.

The nation is undergoing vast societal change, and English is part of this.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meierkord|first=Christiane|date=March 2018|title=English in paradise: the Maldives: English is rapidly establishing itself as a second language in a society transforming from fishing to tourism and trade|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/english-in-paradise-the-maldives/84E0B35287213D3E1A7645FFD32BC16D|journal=English Today|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2\u201311|doi=10.1017/S0266078417000475|issn=0266-0784}}</ref>\n\n===Population by locality===\n{{Largest cities of the Maldives}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of the Maldives}}\n\n{{see also|Maldivian cuisine|Maldivian folklore}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\n\n[[File:Maahefun Fuvahmulah.JPG|thumb|Maahefun Festival in [[Fuvahmulah]]]]\n\nThe culture of the Maldives is influenced by the cultures of the people of different ethnicities who have settled on the islands\u00a0throughout the times.\n\nSince the 12th century AD there were also influences from [[Arabia]] in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.\n\nReflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.<ref>Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

International travel is available on Government owned [[Island Aviation Services]] (branded as Maldivian) operates to nearly all Maldives domestic airports with several [[Bombardier Dash 8]] aircraft and one [[A320]] with international service to India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand.\n\nIn Maldives there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by [[seaplane]] or by boat.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218100252/http://www.elitedivingagency.com/maldives/ Maldives \u2013 \u00c9lite Diving Agency]. Elitedivingagency.com. Retrieved on 29 January 2014.</ref> For several years there were two seaplane companies operating: TMA ([[Trans Maldivian Airways]]) and [[Maldivian Air Taxi]], but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s. There is also another airline, [[Flyme (Villa Air)|Flyme]], which operates using [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] planes to domestic airports, principally [[Villa International Airport|Maamigili]], [[Dharavandhoo Airport|Dharavandhoo]] and some others. [[Manta Air]] begins its first scheduled seaplane service. Its seaplane fleet is made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]] aircraft. In addition to the seaplane service, [[Manta Air]] utilizes [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR 72-600]] aircraft to operate domestic flights to [[Dhaalu Airport]], [[Dharavandhoo Airport]] and [[Kooddoo Airport]] from the main [[Velana International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Manta Air begins its first scheduled seaplane service |url=https://corporatemaldives.com/manta-air-begins-its-first-scheduled-seaplane-service/ |website=corporatemaldives.com |accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> Depending on the distance of the destination island from the airport, resorts organise [[speedboat]] transfers or [[seaplane]] flights directly to the resort island jetty for their guests. Several daily flights operate from [[Velana International Airport]] to the 12 domestic and international airports in the country. Scheduled ferries also operate from [[Mal\u00e9]] to many of the atolls. The traditional Maldivian boat is called [[dhoni]]. Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although slower, is relatively cheaper and convenient.\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Maldives National University]] is one of the country's three institutions of higher education. Its mission statement is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>To create, discover, preserve and disseminate knowledge that are necessary to enhance the lives and livelihoods of people and essential for the cultural, social and economic development of the society so that this nation shall remain free and Islamic forever.<ref name=MNU>{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/vision-mission/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health. The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades. In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry. In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services. In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded. The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first degree programme: Bachelor of Arts. On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011.<ref name=MNU />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Index of Maldives-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Maldives]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* ''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''.
