Sources tell that the chapel was supposed to be transferred to the 50-hectare property of Architect Acuzar to complete the old town setting of the property that he is developing.

Originally a privately owned hacienda chapel, it is now used as a community chapel and masses are consistently held inside the chapel every Saturday at 5:00 PM. It was erected in 1861 by Don Felino Gil, founder of the Escuela de Artes y Oficios (now [[Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University]]), recognized as the oldest trade school in Asia.<ref name=\"Henares - Pio Chapel\">{{cite web|last1=Henares|first1=Ivan|title=Pampanga: Pio Chapel and the ethics of transferring heritage structures|url=http://www.ivanhenares.com/2006/11/pio-chapel-and-ethics-of-transferring.html|website=www.ivanhenares.com|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Don Felino, a prominent Spanish military man responsible for paving the way for the coming of Spanish missionaries in the area, acquired vast tracts of land as reward for his service.

Moreover, the circular form of the chapel is a rarity during the era of its construction, together with the oval-shaped Saint Pancratius chapel of [[Paco Park]]. Both structures predate another prominent circular chapel, the [[Parish of the Holy Sacrifice]] in [[University of the Philippines]], Diliman, by almost a hundred years.<ref name=\"Henares - Pio Chapel\" />\n\n==Architecture==\nThe chapel features a two-level fa\u00e7ade, with Tuscan columns flanking a semicircular arch main portal on the first level and a semicircular arch window on the second level. The fa\u00e7ade is topped by a triangular pediment bearing the inscription 1861, the year the chapel was completed.<ref name=HCS>{{cite web|title=Heritage Conservation Society - Pio Chapel|url=http://heritageconservation.wordpress.com/2006/07/27/pio-chapel-porac/|website=heritageconservation.wordpress.com|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> The roofing of the first level moves toward the center of the structure, where a smaller polygonal dome caps the entire chapel.\n\n==Controversy on The Chapel\u2019s Preservation==\nDuring the early years of the 21st century, news spread out that the chapel has been sold to Architect Gerry Acuzar, president of the New San Jose Builders, Inc. and known for his collection of antique houses which he dismantle and transfer to his estate at Bagac, Bataan (now the [[Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar]], an open-air museum and hotel-resort). Sources tell that the chapel was supposed to be transferred to the 50-hectare property of Architect Acuzar to complete the old town setting of the property that he is developing. The news alarmed heritage conservation advocates, stating the heritage structures lose their value when they are removed from the context from which it such buildings are originally built on.<ref name=\"Henares - Pio Chapel\" /> As of writing, the chapel still remains on its original setting.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church (Porac)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches in Pampanga]]\n[[Category:Baroque architecture in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:1861 establishments in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic chapels in the Philippines]]\n", "name_user": "Haring Bayan", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pio_Chapel"}

It lies in the most western part of the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]] neighborhood ([[Amsterdam-Centrum|Centrum]] borough), next to the [[Jordaan]], between the Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Westerkerk was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style according to designs by architect Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621). He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the 'Zuiderkerk'. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser (1595-1676) and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of 58 meters and a width of 29 meters. The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles. The three-aisled basilica has a rectangular plan with two transepts of equal dimensions. As a result, the plan for this church was given the form of two Greek crosses connected with each other.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\">{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|url=|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> (a patriarchal cross).\n\nSeveral older churches in Amsterdam, such as [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] and [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], were originally built before the Reformation and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation in 1578. The Westerkerk was one of the first purposely built Protestant churches. The [[Noorderkerk]] and [[Zuiderkerk]] preceded the Westerkerk. Today the Westerkerk remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants, and is still in use by the PKN (Protestantse Kerk in Nederland)\n\n==Main Duyschot organ==\n[[File:Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThere was no organ when the Westerkerk was consecrated on Whit Sunday the 8th of June in 1631. According to [[Calvinism]], playing instrumental music inside the church was still considered 'profane' in those days. It took many years of consultation until an organ was finally allowed. At first there was still talk of moving the small organ (koororgel) used in the Nieuwe- or the 'Oudekerk' but the pipes of this 'Oudekerk' choir organ were finally moved to the 'Zuiderkerk'. In 1681 the Westerkerk decided on commissioning organ builder Roelof Barentszn Duyschot for the construction of a new organ. Before it was finished he died and in 1686 the new organ was finished by his son Johannes Duyschot. Later in 1727 it was enlarged with an extra third keyboard by Christiaan Vater who learned his profession at [[Arp Schnitger]].\n\nMany alterations were done on the organ in the course of time. In the 19th century in 1895 even a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Lucky enough many of the old pipes and the wind chests were re used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and even a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.\n\nSo between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by [[Flentrop]] organ builders in [[Zaandam]] to its former mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and stop triggers beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. During the restoration of the inside of the church the organ was brought to Zaandam at Flentrop Orgelbouw for cleaning. In spring 2020 it was replaced in the church and on the 18th of April the new organist Evan Bogerd did the commissioning concert on internet (youtube at 8pm Amsterdam) For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants  are necessary for triggering these stops.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=948LjA9ymCg See in this piece 'F\u00e8te Dieu' by Hendrik Andriessen how the stops work. Organ played by Iddo van der Giessen and his father and Evan Bogerd on the stops]</ref>\n\nIn the summer season from April till the end of October there is a weekly free lunchtime concert on Friday at 1pm. In August there is a free concert almost every day for a week 'Geen dag zonder Bach' ('Not a day without Bach') and the 'Grachten' (Canal) festival.  A noncommittal money collection is held after the concert at the exit. The money is used for the costs of the maintenance of the concerts and the organs. Music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685-1750) is performed almost weekly in the divine Sunday services. Bach was born in 1685, that is a year before the organ was finished but as far as we know, he never visited Amsterdam. His music sounds like it was made for this baroque instrument. See the site of Westerkerk for the Lunchtime concert schedule.\n\nOrganist in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4oVxGWSd4 Jos van der Kooy former organist performing Bach on the Duyschot organ]</ref>\n\n== Stoplist of the Duyschot Organ ==\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Rugwerk''' (Chaire organ) CDE\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holpijp 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Open Fluit 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sifflet 1\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sexquialter II-III ranks\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 16' Td\n|-\n|Prestant 8' Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen  8'\n|-\n|Octaaf 4' Td\n|-\n|Nasard 3' Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2' Td\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Scherp IV-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Sexquialter  III-IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Fagot 16'\n|-\n|Trompet 8'\n|-\n|\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III Bovenwerk''' (Oberwerk organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Baarpijp 8\u2032 \n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holfluit 4\u2032\n|-\n|Quint 3\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Woudfluit 2' Td\n|-\n|Tertiaan II-III ranks\n|-\n|Ruispijp III-VI ranks\n|-\n|Dulciaan 8\u2032\n|-\n|Vox Humana 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedals''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Bourdon 16\u2032\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032\n|-\n|Roerquint 6\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032\n|-\n|Bazuin 16\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 4\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\nCouplers and shutters:\n* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.\n* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P \n* Td = Treble is doubled\n\n== The paintings of the organ ==\n[[File:Interieur, orgel, detail - binnenzijde van het linker hoofdwerkluik, 'De Koningin van Scheba bezoekt Koning Salamo'.

On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. On the right panel we see the [[Queen of Sheba]] presenting gifts to King [[Solomon]]. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Li\u00e8ge in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th Century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The [[grisaille]]s on the 'rugwerk' panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The [[four evangelists]] with their items are showen. The inside of the 'rugwerk' shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.\n\n== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==\n[[File:Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThe small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered  in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restauration it was packed against the dust.\n\nStoplist\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"24\" cellpadding=\"16\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''I Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Prestant 4'\n|-\n| Gemshoorn 4'\n|-\n| Octaaf 2'\n|-\n| Sesquialter II ranks\n|-\n| Mixtuur III-IV ranks\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''II Borstwerk''' (Swell organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Roerfluit 4'\t\n|-\n| Nachthoorn 2'\t\n|-\n| Cimbel I-II ranks\t\n|-\n| Regaal 8'\n|-\n| ''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Subbas 16'\t\n|}\n|}\n* Couplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\n\n== The tower with the spire ==\n[[File:Part from Westertoren, gravure in Architectura Moderna - Amsterdam - 20013240 - RCE.jpg|left|75px|thumb|Not realized part from Westertoren, designed by Hendrick de Keyser]]\n[[File:WestertorenAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|150px|Westertoren]]\nThe tower, called the Westertoren (\"Western tower\"), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (\u00b1286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested [[Jacob van Campen]] was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/the-grachtengordel/the-westerkerk.aspx|title=The Westerkerk|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bells in the 'Westertoren' ==\nJust above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony|Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by [[Eijsbouts]] replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to 4 octaves and is tuned in [[Meantone temperament]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImw1T4X0xk Boudewijn Zwart performs: Sonata in d (2 parts) by [[Baldassare Galuppi]] - Choral 'Ich ruff zu Dir' by Johann Sebastian [[Bach]] - Entry of the Gladiators by [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]] and Wien bleibt Wien by [[Johann Schrammel]].]</ref> It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours. (At the request of the residents of the 'Jordaan' District.) The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from [[Zutphen]] in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F<sup>0</sup>) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509&nbsp;kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this [[Bourdon (bell)|Bourdon]] bell is: 'VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636' The smaller bell (A<sup>1</sup>) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city [[carillon]]eur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2015) Boudewijn Zwart is the City Carilloneur.\n\n[[File:Westerkerk van Amsterdam, luiden van klokken - SoundCloud - Beeld en Geluid.ogg|thumb|Westerkerk Amsterdam, ringing the bells for a service]]\nIn a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by Fran\u00e7ois Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the 'Our Father'. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon. The latest renovation works on the carillon were in 2006 when the tower was also renovated. In that year the crown on top was also painted in its original blue color.\n\n== Rembrandt ==\n[[File:Westerkerk - Kirche innen 6 Rembrandt-Epitaph.jpg|thumb|100px|Remembrance stone copied from ''[[The Night Watch]]''.]]\n[[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered 'kerkgraf' (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the 'Nachtwacht'. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>  Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt's life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.\n\nRembrandt's lover [[Hendrickje Stoffels]] was also buried here, as was Rembrandt's son [[Titus van Rijn]].<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are [[Nicolaes Berchem]], [[Gillis d'Hondecoeter]],  [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] and [[Govert Flinck]].\n\n== Dutch Royal Family ==\n[[File:Beatrix1966Claus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Beatrix and Claus van Amsberg]]\nOn March 10, 1966, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] married Prince [[Claus von Amsberg]] in the Westerkerk.

The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary \u2013 its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort.

Later in 1727 it was enlarged with an extra third keyboard by Christiaan Vater who learned his profession at [[Arp Schnitger]].\n\nMany alterations were done on the organ in the course of time. In the 19th century in 1895 even a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Lucky enough many of the old pipes and the wind chests were re used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and even a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.\n\nSo between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by [[Flentrop]] organ builders in [[Zaandam]] to its former mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and stop triggers beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. During the restauration of the inside of the church the organ was brought to Zaandam at Flentrop Orgelbouw for cleaning. In spring 2020 it was replaced in the church and on the 18th of April the new organist Evan Bogerd did the commissioning concert on internet (youtube at 8pm Amsterdam) For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants  are necessary for triggering these stops.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=948LjA9ymCg See in this piece 'F\u00e8te Dieu' by Hendrik Andriessen how the stops work. Organ played by Iddo van der Giessen and his father and Evan Bogerd on the stops]</ref>\n\nIn the summer season from April till the end of October there is a weekly free lunchtime concert on Friday at 1pm. In August there is a free concert almost every day for a week 'Geen dag zonder Bach' ('Not a day without Bach') and the 'Grachten' (Canal) festival.  A noncommittal money collection is held after the concert at the exit. The money is used for the costs of the maintenance of the concerts and the organs. Music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685-1750) is performed almost weekly in the divine Sunday services. Bach was born in 1685, that is a year before the organ was finished but as far as we know, he never visited Amsterdam. His music sounds like it was made for this baroque instrument. See the site of Westerkerk for the Lunchtime concert schedule.\n\nOrganist in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4oVxGWSd4 Jos van der Kooy former organist performing Bach on the Duyschot organ]</ref>\n\n== Stoplist of the Duyschot Organ ==\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Rugwerk''' (Chaire organ) CDE\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holpijp 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Open Fluit 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sifflet 1\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sexquialter II-III ranks\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 16' Td\n|-\n|Prestant 8' Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen  8'\n|-\n|Octaaf 4' Td\n|-\n|Nasard 3' Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2' Td\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Scherp IV-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Sexquialter  III-IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Fagot 16'\n|-\n|Trompet 8'\n|-\n|\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III Bovenwerk''' (Oberwerk organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Baarpijp 8\u2032 \n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holfluit 4\u2032\n|-\n|Quint 3\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Woudfluit 2' Td\n|-\n|Tertiaan II-III ranks\n|-\n|Ruispijp III-VI ranks\n|-\n|Dulciaan 8\u2032\n|-\n|Vox Humana 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedals''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Bourdon 16\u2032\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032\n|-\n|Roerquint 6\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032\n|-\n|Bazuin 16\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 4\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\nCouplers and shutters:\n* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.\n* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P \n* Td = Treble is doubled\n\n== The paintings of the organ ==\n[[File:Interieur, orgel, detail - binnenzijde van het linker hoofdwerkluik, 'De Koningin van Scheba bezoekt Koning Salamo'.

On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. On the right panel we see the [[Queen of Sheba]] presenting gifts to King [[Solomon]]. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Li\u00e8ge in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th Century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The [[grisaille]]s on the 'rugwerk' panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The [[four evangelists]] with their items are showen. The inside of the 'rugwerk' shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.\n\n== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==\n[[File:Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThe small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered  in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restauration it was packed against the dust.\n\nStoplist\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"24\" cellpadding=\"16\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''I Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Prestant 4'\n|-\n| Gemshoorn 4'\n|-\n| Octaaf 2'\n|-\n| Sesquialter II ranks\n|-\n| Mixtuur III-IV ranks\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''II Borstwerk''' (Swell organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Roerfluit 4'\t\n|-\n| Nachthoorn 2'\t\n|-\n| Cimbel I-II ranks\t\n|-\n| Regaal 8'\n|-\n| ''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Subbas 16'\t\n|}\n|}\n* Couplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\n\n== The tower with the spire ==\n[[File:Part from Westertoren, gravure in Architectura Moderna - Amsterdam - 20013240 - RCE.jpg|left|75px|thumb|Not realized part from Westertoren, designed by Hendrick de Keyser]]\n[[File:WestertorenAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|150px|Westertoren]]\nThe tower, called the Westertoren (\"Western tower\"), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (\u00b1286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested [[Jacob van Campen]] was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/the-grachtengordel/the-westerkerk.aspx|title=The Westerkerk|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bells in the 'Westertoren' ==\nJust above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony|Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by [[Eijsbouts]] replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to 4 octaves and is tuned in [[Meantone temperament]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImw1T4X0xk Boudewijn Zwart performs: Sonata in d (2 parts) by [[Baldassare Galuppi]] - Choral 'Ich ruff zu Dir' by Johann Sebastian [[Bach]] - Entry of the Gladiators by [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]] and Wien bleibt Wien by [[Johann Schrammel]].]</ref> It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours. (At the request of the residents of the 'Jordaan' District.) The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from [[Zutphen]] in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F<sup>0</sup>) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509&nbsp;kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this [[Bourdon (bell)|Bourdon]] bell is: 'VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636' The smaller bell (A<sup>1</sup>) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city [[carillon]]eur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2015) Boudewijn Zwart is the City Carilloneur.\n\n[[File:Westerkerk van Amsterdam, luiden van klokken - SoundCloud - Beeld en Geluid.ogg|thumb|Westerkerk Amsterdam, ringing the bells for a service]]\nIn a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by Fran\u00e7ois Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the 'Our Father'. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon. The latest renovation works on the carillon were in 2006 when the tower was also renovated. In that year the crown on top was also painted in its original blue color.\n\n== Rembrandt ==\n[[File:Westerkerk - Kirche innen 6 Rembrandt-Epitaph.jpg|thumb|100px|Remembrance stone copied from ''[[The Night Watch]]''.]]\n[[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered 'kerkgraf' (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the 'Nachtwacht'. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>  Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt's life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.\n\nRembrandt's lover [[Hendrickje Stoffels]] was also buried here, as was Rembrandt's son [[Titus van Rijn]].<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are [[Nicolaes Berchem]], [[Gillis d'Hondecoeter]],  [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] and [[Govert Flinck]].\n\n== Dutch Royal Family ==\n[[File:Beatrix1966Claus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Beatrix and Claus van Amsberg]]\nOn March 10, 1966, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] married Prince [[Claus von Amsberg]] in the Westerkerk. The 'Nieuwe Kerk' on Dam square where Royals normally have the weddings, was in renovation at that time.\n\n== Anne Frank ==\nThe Westerkerk is located close to the [[Anne Frank House]] where diarist [[Anne Frank]], her family and others were hid in the 'Achterhuis' from [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution for two years during [[World War II]]. The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary \u2013 its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort. A memorial statue of Anne Frank is located outside the church at Westermarkt.\n\n== Burials ==\n[[File:Amsterdam Westerkerk Innen Langhaus Ost 1.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Westerkerk]]\n* [[Nicolaes Pietersz.
