There have been some efforts over the years at organizing a single-game playoff for the national championship. Sometimes a dominant team in one state would defeat a dominant team in a neighboring state after the regular season and then would self-claim the national championship. However, sometimes such a game could not be scheduled, like in 1936 after [[Massillon Washington High School|Washington High School]] of [[Massillon, Ohio]], refused to withhold its black players in a proposed game with segregated [[Central High School (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Central High School]] of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Central High subsequently proclaimed itself national champion that year.

Pine Bluff, for example, had to receive a special waiver from its state to participate in the game. In 1939, the National Sports Council, chaired by columnist Grantland Rice, staged a national championship game Christmas Night in the Orange Bowl, won by Garfield High School, Garfield, New Jersey, 16-13, over Miami High School, Miami, Florida.

There have been some efforts over the years at organizing a single-game playoff for the national championship. Sometimes a dominant team in one state would defeat a dominant team in a neighboring state after the regular season and then would self-claim the national championship. However, sometimes such a game could not be scheduled, like in 1936 after [[Massillon Washington High School|Washington High School]] of [[Massillon, Ohio]], refused to withhold its black players in a proposed game with segregated [[Central High School (Knoxville, Tennessee)|Central High School]] of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Central High subsequently proclaimed itself national champion that year. On December 31, 1938, [[duPont Manual Magnet High School|duPont Manual]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[New Britain High School|New Britain]] of [[New Britain, Connecticut|Connecticut]] played in an actual national championship game in Baton Rouge with the Louisiana Sports Association as the formal sponsor \u2013 and, by extension, the [[Sugar Bowl]] Committee, which held a series of sporting events leading up to the Sugar Bowl game itself.

Pine Bluff, for example, had to receive a special waiver from its state to participate in the game. In 1939, the National Sports Council, chaired by columnist Grantland Rice, staged a national championship game Christmas Night in the Orange Bowl, won by Garfield High School, Garfield, New Jersey, 16-13, over Miami High School, Miami, Florida. Unlike the LSA Game, it featured two undefeated and untied teams from different sections of the country. <ref>Gola, Hank (2018).

{"title_page": "Linguistic purism in English", "text_new": "{{short description|Efforts at retaining Germanic influences in the language}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{multiple issues|{{more footnotes|date=May 2016}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2016}}}}\n'''Linguistic purism in English''' is the preference for using words of native origin rather than foreign-derived ones. \"Native\" can mean \"[[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]]\" or it can be widened to include all [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words. Linguistic purism in English primarily focuses on words of [[Romance languages|Latinate]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, due to their prominence in the English language and the belief that they may be difficult to understand. In its mildest form, it merely means using [[List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English|existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones]] (such as using ''begin'' instead of ''commence''). In a less mild form, it also involves coining new words from Germanic roots (such as ''[[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]'' for ''vocabulary''). In a more extreme form, it also involves reviving native words which are no longer widely used (such as ''[[wikt:ettle|ettle]]'' for ''intend''). The resulting language is sometimes called '''''Anglish''''' (coined by the author and humorist [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]]), or '''''Roots English''''' (referring to the idea that it is a \"return to the roots\" of [[English language|English]]). The mild form is often advocated as part of [[Plain English]], but the more extreme form has been and is still a fringe movement; the latter can also be undertaken as a form of [[constrained writing]].\n\nEnglish [[linguistic purism]] is discussed by [[David Crystal]] in the ''Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''. The idea dates at least to the [[inkhorn term]] controversy of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, writers such as [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[William Barnes]] advocated linguistic purism and tried to introduce words like ''[[wikt:birdlore|birdlore]]'' for ''ornithology'' and ''[[wikt:bendsome|bendsome]]'' for ''flexible''. A notable supporter in the 20th century was [[George Orwell]], who had a preference for plain Saxon words over complex Latin or Greek ones, and the idea continues to have advocates today.\n\n==History==\n\n===Old English and Middle English===\n[[Old English]] adopted a small number of Greco-Roman loan words from an early period, especially in the context of [[Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianity]] (''[[wikt:bishop|bishop]]'', ''[[wikt:priest|priest]]''). From the 9th century ([[Danelaw]]) it borrowed a much larger number of [[Old Norse]] words, many for every-day terms (''[[wikt:skull|skull]]'', ''[[wikt:egg|egg]]'', ''[[wikt:skirt|skirt]]'').\n\nAfter the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066\u201371, the top level of English society was replaced by people who spoke [[Old Norman]] (a [[dialect]] of [[Old French]]). It evolved into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and became the language of the state. Hence, those who wished to be involved in fields such as law and governance were required to learn it (see \"[[Law French]]\" for example).\n\nIt was in this [[Middle English]] period that the English language borrowed a slew of Romance loan words (via Anglo-Norman) \u2013 see \"[[Latin influence in English]]\". However, there were a few writers who tried to withstand the overbearing influence of Anglo-Norman. Their goal was to provide literature to the English-speaking masses in their [[vernacular]] or mother tongue. This meant not only writing in English, but also taking care not to use any words of Romance origin, which would likely not be understood by the readers. Examples of this kind of literature are the ''[[Ormulum]]'', ''[[Layamon's Brut]]'', ''[[Ayenbite of Inwyt]]'', and the [[Katherine Group]] of manuscripts in the \"[[AB language]]\".\n\n===Early Modern English===\n{{main|Inkhorn term}}\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, controversy over needless foreign borrowings from Latin and Greek (known as \"[[inkhorn term]]s\") was rife. Critics argued that English already had words with identical meanings. However, many of the new words gained an equal footing with the native Germanic words, and often replaced them.\n\nWriters such as [[Thomas Elyot]] flooded their writings with foreign borrowings, while writers such as [[John Cheke]] sought to keep their writings \"pure\".{{cn|date=February 2020|reason=Originally cited with a reference invoking \"Crystal\", which did not exist}} Cheke wrote:<blockquote>I am of this view that our own tung should be written cleane and pure, unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.</blockquote>\n\nIn reaction, some writers tried either to resurrect older English words, such as ''[[wikt:gleeman|gleeman]]'' for musician, ''[[wikt:sicker|sicker]]'' (itself a [[Proto-Germanic]] borrowing from Latin ''s\u0113c\u016brus'') for certainly, ''[[wikt:inwit|inwit]]'' for conscience, and ''[[wikt:yblent|yblent]]'' for confused, or to make new words from Germanic roots, e.g. ''[[wikt:endsay|endsay]]'' for conclusion, ''[[wikt:yeartide|yeartide]]'' for anniversary, ''[[wikt:foresayer|foresayer]]'' for prophet. However, few of these words remain in common use.\n\n===Modern English===\n[[File:William Barnes poet.jpg|thumb|William Barnes, a notable advocate of English linguistic purism]]\nA noted advocate of English linguistic purism was 19th-century English writer, poet, minister, and philologist [[William Barnes]], who sought to make scholarly English easier to understand without a classical education. Barnes lamented the \"needless inbringing\" of foreign words, instead using native words from his [[West Country dialects|own dialect]] and coining new ones based on Old English roots. These included ''[[wikt:speechcraft|speechcraft]]'' for ''grammar'', ''[[wikt:birdlore|birdlore]]'' for ''ornithology'', ''[[wikt:fore-elder|fore-elders]]'' for ''ancestors'' and ''[[wikt:bendsome|bendsome]]'' for ''flexible''. Another 19th-century poet who supported linguistic purism was [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. He wrote in 1882, \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done ... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity\".<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p.328</ref>\n\nIn his 1946 essay \"[[Politics and the English Language]]\", [[George Orwell]] wrote:<blockquote>Bad writers\u2014especially scientific, political, and sociological writers\u2014are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones.</blockquote>\n\nA contemporary of Orwell, the [[Australia]]n composer [[Percy Grainger]], wrote English with only Germanic words and called it \"blue-eyed English\". For example, a ''composer'' became a ''tonesmith''. He also used English terms instead of the traditional Italian ones as performance markings in his scores, e.g. ''louden lots'' instead of ''{{lang|it|molto crescendo}}''.\n\n[[Lee Hollander]]'s 1962 English translation of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems), written almost solely with Germanic words, would also inspire many future \"Anglish\" writers.\n\nIn 1966, [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]] wrote three articles in ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. His articles, entitled '1066 and All Saxon', published on 15, 22 and 29 June, posed the question of what England would be like had it not happened. They included an example of what he called \"Anglish\", such as a sample of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s writing as it might have been if the conquest had failed. He gave \"a bow to [[William Barnes#Linguistic purism|William Barnes]]\".\n\nIn 1989, [[science fiction]] writer [[Poul Anderson]] wrote a text about basic [[atomic theory]] called ''[[Uncleftish Beholding]]''. It was written using almost only words of Germanic origin, and was meant to show what English scientific works might look like without foreign borrowings.

Linguistic purism in English primarily focuses on words of [[Romance languages|Latinate]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, due to their prominence in the English language and the belief that they may be difficult to understand. In its mildest form, it merely means using [[List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English|existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones]] (such as using ''begin'' instead of ''commence''). In a less mild form, it also involves coining new words from Germanic roots (such as ''[[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]'' for ''vocabulary''). In a more extreme form, it also involves reviving native words which are no longer widely used (such as ''[[wikt:ettle|ettle]]'' for ''intend''). The resulting language is sometimes called '''''Anglish''''' (coined by the author and humorist [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]]), or '''''Roots English''''' (referring to the idea that it is a \"return to the roots\" of [[English language|English]]). The mild form is often advocated as part of [[Plain English]], but the more extreme form has been and is still a fringe movement; the latter can also be undertaken as a form of [[constrained writing]].\n\nEnglish [[linguistic purism]] is discussed by [[David Crystal]] in the ''Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''. The idea dates at least to the [[inkhorn term]] controversy of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, writers such as [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[William Barnes]] advocated linguistic purism and tried to introduce words like ''[[wikt:birdlore|birdlore]]'' for ''ornithology'' and ''[[wikt:bendsome|bendsome]]'' for ''flexible''. A notable supporter in the 20th century was [[George Orwell]], who had a preference for plain Saxon words over complex Latin or Greek ones, and the idea continues to have advocates today.\n\n==History==\n\n===Old English and Middle English===\n[[Old English]] adopted a small number of Greco-Roman loan words from an early period, especially in the context of [[Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianity]] (''[[wikt:bishop|bishop]]'', ''[[wikt:priest|priest]]''). From the 9th century ([[Danelaw]]) it borrowed a much larger number of [[Old Norse]] words, many for every-day terms (''[[wikt:skull|skull]]'', ''[[wikt:egg|egg]]'', ''[[wikt:skirt|skirt]]'').\n\nAfter the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066\u201371, the top level of English society was replaced by people who spoke [[Old Norman]] (a [[dialect]] of [[Old French]]). It evolved into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and became the language of the state. Hence, those who wished to be involved in fields such as law and governance were required to learn it (see \"[[Law French]]\" for example).\n\nIt was in this [[Middle English]] period that the English language borrowed a slew of Romance loan words (via Anglo-Norman) \u2013 see \"[[Latin influence in English]]\". However, there were a few writers who tried to withstand the overbearing influence of Anglo-Norman. Their goal was to provide literature to the English-speaking masses in their [[vernacular]] or mother tongue. This meant not only writing in English, but also taking care not to use any words of Romance origin, which would likely not be understood by the readers. Examples of this kind of literature are the ''[[Ormulum]]'', ''[[Layamon's Brut]]'', ''[[Ayenbite of Inwyt]]'', and the [[Katherine Group]] of manuscripts in the \"[[AB language]]\".\n\n===Early Modern English===\n{{main|Inkhorn term}}\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, controversy over needless foreign borrowings from Latin and Greek (known as \"[[inkhorn term]]s\") was rife. Critics argued that English already had words with identical meanings. However, many of the new words gained an equal footing with the native Germanic words, and often replaced them.\n\nWriters such as [[Thomas Elyot]] flooded their writings with foreign borrowings, whilst writers such as [[John Cheke]] sought to keep their writings \"pure\".{{cn|date=February 2020|reason=Originally cited with a reference invoking \"Crystal\", which did not exist}} Cheke wrote:<blockquote>I am of this view that our own tung should be written cleane and pure, unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.</blockquote>\n\nIn reaction, some writers tried either to resurrect older English words, such as ''[[wikt:gleeman|gleeman]]'' for musician, ''[[wikt:sicker|sicker]]'' (itself a [[Proto-Germanic]] borrowing from Latin ''s\u0113c\u016brus'') for certainly, ''[[wikt:inwit|inwit]]'' for conscience, and ''[[wikt:yblent|yblent]]'' for confused, or to make new words from Germanic roots, e.g. ''[[wikt:endsay|endsay]]'' for conclusion, ''[[wikt:yeartide|yeartide]]'' for anniversary, ''[[wikt:foresayer|foresayer]]'' for prophet. However, few of these words remain in common use.\n\n===Modern English===\n[[File:William Barnes poet.jpg|thumb|William Barnes, a notable advocate of English linguistic purism]]\nA noted advocate of English linguistic purism was 19th-century English writer, poet, minister, and philologist [[William Barnes]], who sought to make scholarly English easier to understand without a classical education. Barnes lamented the \"needless inbringing\" of foreign words, instead using native words from his [[West Country dialects|own dialect]] and coining new ones based on Old English roots. These included ''[[wikt:speechcraft|speechcraft]]'' for ''grammar'', ''[[wikt:birdlore|birdlore]]'' for ''ornithology'', ''[[wikt:fore-elder|fore-elders]]'' for ''ancestors'' and ''[[wikt:bendsome|bendsome]]'' for ''flexible''. Another 19th-century poet who supported linguistic purism was [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. He wrote in 1882, \"It makes one weep to think what English might have been; for in spite of all that Shakespeare and Milton have done ... no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity\".<ref>Nils Langer, Winifred V. Davies. ''Linguistic purism in the Germanic languages''. Walter de Gruyter, 2005. p.328</ref>\n\nIn his 1946 essay \"[[Politics and the English Language]]\", [[George Orwell]] wrote:<blockquote>Bad writers\u2014especially scientific, political, and sociological writers\u2014are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones.</blockquote>\n\nA contemporary of Orwell, the [[Australia]]n composer [[Percy Grainger]], wrote English with only Germanic words and called it \"blue-eyed English\". For example, a ''composer'' became a ''tonesmith''. He also used English terms instead of the traditional Italian ones as performance markings in his scores, e.g. ''louden lots'' instead of ''{{lang|it|molto crescendo}}''.\n\n[[Lee Hollander]]'s 1962 English translation of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' (a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems), written almost solely with Germanic words, would also inspire many future \"Anglish\" writers.\n\nIn 1966, [[Paul Jennings (British author)|Paul Jennings]] wrote three articles in ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', to commemorate the 900th anniversary of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. His articles, entitled '1066 and All Saxon', published on 15, 22 and 29 June, posed the question of what England would be like had it not happened. They included an example of what he called \"Anglish\", such as a sample of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s writing as it might have been if the conquest had failed. He gave \"a bow to [[William Barnes#Linguistic purism|William Barnes]]\".\n\nIn 1989, [[science fiction]] writer [[Poul Anderson]] wrote a text about basic [[atomic theory]] called ''[[Uncleftish Beholding]]''. It was written using almost only words of Germanic origin, and was meant to show what English scientific works might look like without foreign borrowings. In 1992, [[Douglas Hofstadter]] jokingly referred to the style as \"Ander-Saxon\". This term has since been used to describe any scientific writings that use only Germanic words.\n\nAnderson used techniques including:\n* extension of sense (''[[wikt:mote|motes]]'' for 'particles');\n* [[calque]]s, i.e., translation of the [[morpheme]]s of the foreign word (''[[wikt:uncleft|uncleft]]'' for ''atom'', which is from Greek ''[[wikt:\u1f00-|a-]]'' 'not' and ''[[wikt:\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|temnein]]'' 'to cut'; ''ymirstuff'' for 'uranium', referencing [[Ymir]], a giant in [[Norse mythology]], whose role is similar to that of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] in [[Greek mythology]]);\n* calques from other Germanic languages like [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''[[wikt:waterstuff|waterstuff]]'' from the German ''{{lang|de|Wasserstoff}}'' / Dutch ''{{lang|nl|waterstof}}'' for 'hydrogen'; ''[[wikt:sourstuff|sourstuff]]'' from the German ''{{lang|de|Sauerstoff}}'' / Dutch ''{{lang|nl|zuurstof}}'' for 'oxygen');\n* coining (''firststuff'' for 'element'; ''lightrotting'' for 'radioactive decay').\n\nThe first chapter of [[Alan Moore]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'' uses mostly Germanic words.\n\nAnother approach, without a specific name-tag, can be seen in the September 2009 publication ''How We'd Talk if the English had Won in 1066'', by David Cowley (the title referencing the [[Battle of Hastings]]).

It was released on 26 April 1993 as the second single from their eighth studio album, ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' (1993). The song reached number 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and matched the success of the previous single \"[[I Feel You]]\" on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, where it reached 1.\n \nThe 7\" version of \"Walking in My Shoes\" is not the same as the one in the ''Songs of Faith and Devotion'' album. The sound has been made more noisy and dirty, especially the drums in the verse, and the intro has been shortened. When performed live, elements of the \"Grungy Gonads\" mix are used in an extended intro and throughout the song.\n\nThe B-side is \"My Joy\", the only exclusive B-side from the ''Songs of Faith and Devotion'' album, and is a rock track in the vein of \"I Feel You\" and \"Halo\".\n\nThe song was cited by then-member [[Alan Wilder]] to be his favourite song from the album together with \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\".<ref>\"We Were Going to Live Together, Record Together And It Was Going to Be Wonderful\" - Depeche Mode documentary about the album Songs of Faith and Devotion.

At the beginning of the second verse, there's a shot of [[Martin Gore]], [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]], and [[Alan Wilder]] with naked women on their laps. This was removed in the [[MTV]] version in the US and replaced with footage of the three members standing still, alone, from earlier in the video. The uncut version is on ''[[The Videos 86-98]]'', ''[[Devotional (video)|Devotional]]'', ''[[The Best of Depeche Mode Volume 1|The Best Of, Volume 1]]'' and ''[[Video Singles Collection]]'' DVDs.\n\n==Release and commercial reception==\nThe single was released on 26 April 1993 in the UK and on 27 April of the same year in the United States; \"Walking in My Shoes\" failed to enter list of the UK top ten and the American top 40, nevertheless the song became a top ten hit in some countries of Continental Europe, and became a recurring song during the live performances of the band since 1993. The song peaked number 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 69 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], however, it peaked number one on the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock Track chart]].\n\nThe single was featured during the opening credits of episode 9 of season 2 of [[USA Network]] series ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', entitled \"eps2.7_init_5.fve\".<ref name=\"IMDB\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=tv_series/ |title=IMDB \"Most Popular TV Series\" |work=IMDB |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Track listings==\n===7\", Cassette: Mute / Bong22, CBong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n*7\" released as a promo only, not commercially released, hence why both songs appear on the 12\" version. \"Walking in My Shoes\" is the first Depeche Mode single not to have a commercial 7\" release in the UK.\n\n===12\": Mute / 12Bong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24 (remixed by [[Jonny Dollar]] with [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"My Joy\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 3:57\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11 (remixed by [[Steve Lyon]] and [[Depeche Mode]])\n\n===12\": Mute / L12Bong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35 (remixed by [[William Orbit]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11 (remixed by Spirit Feel)\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n\n===CD: Mute / CDBong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24 (remixed by [[Jonny Dollar]] with [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]])\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11 (remixed by Steve Lyon and [[Depeche Mode]])\n\n===CD: Mute / LCDBong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35 (remixed by [[William Orbit]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11 (remixed by Spirit Feel)\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n\n===CD: Mute / CDBong22X (EU)===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54\n*This CD is the 2004 re-release\n\n===Promo 12\": Mute / P12Bong22 (UK)===\n# \"Walking In My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"Walking In My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 5:00\n# \"My Joy\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 3:58\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n\n===12\": Sire/Reprise / 40852-0 (US)===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n\n*Released 4 May 1993\n\n===CD: Sire/Reprise / 40852-2 (US) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:10\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54\n\n*Released 27 April 1993\n* The full version of the \"Random Carpet Mix\" was officially released on ''[[Remixes 81\u201304]]''.\n* All songs written by [[Martin L.

It was released on 26 April 1993 as the second single from their eighth studio album, ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' (1993). The song reached number 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and matched the success of the previous single \"[[I Feel You]]\" on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, where it reached 1.\n \nThe 7\" version of \"Walking in My Shoes\" is not the same as the one in the ''Songs of Faith and Devotion'' album. The sound has been made more noisy and dirty, especially the drums in the verse, and the intro has been shortened. When performed live, elements of the \"Grungy Gonads\" mix are used in an extended intro and throughout the song.\n\nThe B-side is \"My Joy\", the only exclusive B-side from the ''Songs of Faith and Devotion'' album, and is a rock track in the vein of \"I Feel You\" and \"Halo\".\n\nThe song was cited by then-member [[Alan Wilder]] to be his favourite song from the album together with \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\".<ref>\"We Were Going to Live Together, Record Together And It Was Going to Be Wonderful\" - Depeche Mode documentary about the album Songs of Faith and Devotion. Mute, 2006.</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video for \"Walking in My Shoes\" was directed by [[Anton Corbijn]]. At the beginning of the second verse, there's a shot of [[Martin Gore]], [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]], and [[Alan Wilder]] with naked women on their laps. This was removed in the [[MTV]] version in the US and replaced with footage of the three members standing still, alone, from earlier in the video. The uncut version is on ''[[The Videos 86-98]]'', ''[[Devotional (video)|Devotional]]'', ''[[The Best of Depeche Mode Volume 1|The Best Of, Volume 1]]'' and ''[[Video Singles Collection]]'' DVDs.\n\n==Release and commercial reception==\nThe single was released on 26 April 1993 in the UK and on 27 April of the same year in the United States; \"Walking in My Shoes\" failed to enter list of the UK top ten and the American top 40, nevertheless the song became a top ten hit in some countries of Continental Europe, and became a recurring song during the live performances of the band since 1993. The song peaked number 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 69 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], however, it peaked number one on the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock Track chart]].\n\nThe single was featured during the opening credits of episode 9 of season 2 of [[USA Network]] series ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', entitled \"eps2.7_init_5.fve\".<ref name=\"IMDB\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?title_type=tv_series/ |title=IMDB \"Most Popular TV Series\" |work=IMDB |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Track listings==\n===7\", Cassette: Mute / Bong22, CBong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n*7\" released as a promo only, not commercially released, hence why both songs appear on the 12\" version. \"Walking in My Shoes\" is the first Depeche Mode single not to have a commercial 7\" release in the UK.\n\n===12\": Mute / 12Bong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24 (remixed by [[Jonny Dollar]] with [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"My Joy\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 3:57\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11 (remixed by [[Steve Lyon]] and [[Depeche Mode]])\n\n===12\": Mute / L12Bong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35 (remixed by [[William Orbit]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11 (remixed by Spirit Feel)\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n\n===CD: Mute / CDBong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24 (remixed by [[Jonny Dollar]] with [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]])\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11 (remixed by Steve Lyon and [[Depeche Mode]])\n\n===CD: Mute / LCDBong22 (UK) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35 (remixed by [[William Orbit]])\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11 (remixed by Spirit Feel)\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54 (remixed by [[Mark Stent]])\n\n===CD: Mute / CDBong22X (EU)===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54\n*This CD is the 2004 re-release\n\n===Promo 12\": Mute / P12Bong22 (UK)===\n# \"Walking In My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"Walking In My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 5:00\n# \"My Joy\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 3:58\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n\n===12\": Sire/Reprise / 40852-0 (US)===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:35\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n\n*Released 4 May 1993\n\n===CD: Sire/Reprise / 40852-2 (US) ===\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Seven Inch Mix) \u2013 4:59\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Grungy Gonads Mix) \u2013 6:24\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Random Carpet Mix Edit) \u2013 6:10\n# \"My Joy\" (Slow Slide Mix) \u2013 5:11\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Extended Twelve Inch Mix) \u2013 6:54\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Anandamidic Mix) \u2013 6:11\n# \"My Joy\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"Walking in My Shoes\" (Ambient Whale Mix) \u2013 4:54\n\n*Released 27 April 1993\n* The full version of the \"Random Carpet Mix\" was officially released on ''[[Remixes 81\u201304]]''.\n* All songs written by [[Martin L.

On the night of February 19\u201320, 1944 on Engebi Island in the [[Marshall Islands]], Corporal Damato sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow Marines.\n\n==Biography==\nDamato was born on March 28, 1922, in [[Shenandoah, Pennsylvania]]. He was educated in the elementary and high schools of Shenandoah. Prior to enlistment he was last employed as a truck driver.\n\nDamato enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] on January 8, 1942. He went to [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], in May of that year. He distinguished himself during the first year of his enlistment, volunteering for special duty with a select invasion party that took part in the [[Operation Torch|North African landings]]. He was advanced in rate for especially meritorious conduct in action while serving aboard ship at the port city of [[Arzew]], [[Algeria]], on November 8, 1942. Landing with an assault wave entering the port from seaward, he assisted in boarding and seizing vessels in the harbor, and ultimately the port itself. He returned to the United States in March 1943, and three months later sailed for duty in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]].\n\nDamato was serving with an assault company of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marines, 5th Amphibious Corps, on Engebi Island, [[Eniwetok Atoll]], [[Marshall Islands]] when on the night of February 19\u201320, 1944, while in a foxhole with two companions, he threw himself upon an enemy [[hand grenade|grenade]], absorbing the explosion with his body, resulting in his instant death.\n\nCorporal Damato was initially buried in the Temporary American Cemetery on Kiririan Island in the Marshall Islands. Later, his remains were reinterred in the [[National Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Damato's brother, Captain Neil Damato, was killed in action over Germany in 1943 while serving in the US Army Air Corps.\n\n==Honors==\nOn April 9, 1945, the tiny mining community of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania turned out en masse to pay homage to Corporal Damato at the presentation ceremonies for the Medal of Honor. The presentation was made to his mother by Marine Corps Brigadier General M. C. Gregory at the J.W. Cooper High School, where Cpl Damato had been a student.\n\nThe {{USS|Damato|DD-871|6}},  a [[Gearing class destroyer|Gearing-class destroyer]] of the [[United States Navy]], was named in honor of Corporal Damato.\n\nIn June 2009, students from Shenandoah Valley High School began work on a 150-foot-long and up to 30-foot-high mural honoring Damato on the north wall of the American Legion post named after him. With assistance from local artist Martin Brakus, the mural was completed in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mural on American Legion post completed|url=http://standardspeaker.com/news/mural-on-american-legion-post-completed-1.1252189|website=Standard Speaker|publisher=Standard Speaker - Hazelton}}</ref>\n\n==Medal of Honor citation==\nThe [[President of the United States]] takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n<center>\n'''CORPORAL ANTHONY P. DAMATO'''<br/>\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n{{quote| For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with an assault company of the Second Battalion, Twenty-Second Marines, Fifth Amphibious Corps, in action against enemy Japanese forces on [[Eniwetok Atoll]] Marshall Islands, on the night of February 19,-20, 1944. Highly vulnerable to sudden attack by small, fanatical groups of Japanese still at large despite the efficient and determined efforts of our forces to clear the area, Corporal Damato lay with two comrades in a large [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] in his company's defense perimeter which had been dangerously thinned by the forced withdrawal of nearly half of the available men. When one of the enemy approached the foxhole undetected and threw in a hand [[grenade]], Corporal Damato desperately groped for it in the darkness. Realizing the imminent peril to all three and fully aware of the consequences of his act, he unhesitatingly flung himself on the grenade and, although instantly killed as his body absorbed the explosion, saved the lives of his two companions. Corporal Damato's splendid initiative, fearless conduct and valiant sacrifice reflect great upon himself and the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]]. He gallantly gave his life for his comrades.\n\n/S/ [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FRANKLIN D.

On the night of February 19\u201320, 1944 on Engebi Island in the [[Marshall Islands]], Corporal Damato sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow Marines.\n\n==Biography==\nDamato was born on March 28, 1922, in [[Shenandoah, Pennsylvania]]. He was educated in the elementary and high schools of Shenandoah. Prior to enlistment he was last employed as a truck driver.\n\nDamato enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] on January 8, 1942. He went to [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], in May of that year. He distinguished himself during the first year of his enlistment, volunteering for special duty with a select invasion party that took part in the [[Operation Torch|North African landings]]. He was advanced in rate for especially meritorious conduct in action while serving aboard ship at the port city of [[Arzew]], [[Algeria]], on November 8, 1942. Landing with an assault wave entering the port from seaward, he assisted in boarding and seizing vessels in the harbor, and ultimately the port itself. He returned to the United States in March 1943, and three months later sailed for duty in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]].\n\nDamato was serving with an assault company of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marines, 5th Amphibious Corps, on Engebi Island, [[Eniwetok Atoll]], [[Marshall Islands]] when on the night of February 19\u201320, 1944, while in a foxhole with two companions, he threw himself upon an enemy [[hand grenade|grenade]], absorbing the explosion with his body, resulting in his instant death.\n\nCorporal Damato was initially buried in the Temporary American Cemetery on Kiririan Island in the Marshall Islands. Later, his remains were reinterred in the [[National Cemetery of the Pacific]] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Damato's brother, Captain Neil Damato, was killed in action over Germany in 1943 while serving in the US Army Air Corps.\n\n==Honors==\nOn April 9, 1945, the tiny mining community of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania turned out en masse to pay homage to Corporal Damato at the presentation ceremonies for the Medal of Honor. The presentation was made to his mother by Marine Corps Brigadier General M. C. Gregory at the J.W. Cooper High School, where Cpl Damato had been a student.\n\nThe {{USS|Damato|DD-871|6}},  a [[Gearing class destroyer|Gearing-class destroyer]] of the [[United States Navy]], was named in honor of Corporal Damato.\n\nIn June 2009, students from Shenandoah Valley High School began work on a 150-foot-long and up to 30-foot-high mural honoring Damato on the north wall of the American Legion post named after him. With assistance from local artist Martin Brakus, the mural was completed in December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mural on American Legion post completed|url=http://standardspeaker.com/news/mural-on-american-legion-post-completed-1.1252189|website=Standard Speaker|publisher=Standard Speaker - Hazelton}}</ref>\n\n==Medal of Honor citation==\nThe [[President of the United States]] takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n<center>\n'''CORPORAL ANTHONY P. DAMATO'''<br/>\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\n{{quote| For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with an assault company of the Second Battalion, Twenty-Second Marines, Fifth Amphibious Corps, in action against enemy Japanese forces on [[Eniwetok Atoll]] Marshall Islands, on the night of February 19,-20, 1944. Highly vulnerable to sudden attack by small, fanatical groups of Japanese still at large despite the efficient and determined efforts of our forces to clear the area, Corporal Damato lay with two comrades in a large [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] in his company's defense perimeter which had been dangerously thinned by the forced withdrawal of nearly half of the available men. When one of the enemy approached the foxhole undetected and threw in a hand [[grenade]], Corporal Damato desperately groped for it in the darkness. Realizing the imminent peril to all three and fully aware of the consequences of his act, he unhesitatingly flung himself on the grenade and, although instantly killed as his body absorbed the explosion, saved the lives of his two companions. Corporal Damato's splendid initiative, fearless conduct and valiant sacrifice reflect great upon himself and the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]]. He gallantly gave his life for his comrades.\n\n/S/ [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FRANKLIN D.

Created by [[Carl Barks]], they are a family clan of [[Organized crime|organized criminals]] who constantly try to rob [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Their introduction and first appearance was in ''Terror of the Beagle Boys'' (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #134, November 1951), although in this story they only appear in the last frame and have no lines. They appear again in the next issue in a similar fashion, in ''The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill'' (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #135, December 1951).\n\n==The Beagle Boys in comics==\n===Barks/Rosa universe===\nThe Beagle Boys were originally created by [[Carl Barks]], and made their first appearance in the 10-page story ''The Terror of the Beagle Boys'' (WDC #134) that was first published in November 1951. Although the Beagle Boys are only shown very briefly on the last page of this story, it is implied that Scrooge has known about them for a long time. The Beagle Boys are usually depicted as a gang of about three to ten members or more depending on the story, who are identical in appearance and personality. They wear black bandit masks to hide their identities and on their turtleneck sweaters, most often being orange or red, they have their prison number signs. The Beagle Boys are often characterized to be very crude, boastful, aggravating, greedy and self-centered \u2014 among themselves however, they are very loyal and have a strong connection of sibling camaraderie. Although, on some occasions they have shown irritation toward each other, often relating to someone making a mistake or saying something that doesn't fit in with the consensus, like one Beagle Boy's (176-167) overly fondness of [[prune]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US++++8-02|title=The Mysterious Stone Ray|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++58-02|title=The Giant Robot Robbers|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> a weakness that proves to be the Beagle Boys' downfall in some stories. 176-167's love for prunes makes him the only Beagle Boy with a unique characteristic.\n\nThe first story to feature the Beagle Boys in a major role is ''[[Only a Poor Old Man]]'' (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #1, March 1952), which serves as a template for virtually all future Beagle Boys appearances, and establishes them as a serious threat to Scrooge's fortune. In the same story they are called \"''the most awful gang of crooks in the country\"'' by [[Donald Duck]]. This most often manifests with them cleverly coming up with various and elaborate schemes to try to break into and steal from Scrooge McDuck's well secured [[Money Bin]]. On occasion they are even shown to have highly intellectual capacities, as they are able to earn [[academic degree]]s in various fields. Among individual Beagle Boys, some of these degrees include: [[Electroencephalography|cranial encephalography]], [[psychology]], [[chemistry]], [[metallurgy]] and electropyrotechnology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++63-02&redirected=1|title=House of Haunts|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> These were often seen by the [[Federal government of the United States|government]] as attempts at [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], but in reality it was a charade by the Beagle Boys to use their newly acquired skills for robberies. They are also experts at trickery, including [[disguise]]s, and [[animal training]]; like using [[cormorant]]s as [[Bomber|aerial bombers]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++386-02|title=Only A Poor Old Man|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> as well as having a large arsenal of various weapons, explosives and machines. When needed, they have been shown to be able to use force or threats to get what they want. With all things considered however, the Beagle Boys are often attributed not to be as clever they think they are, often gullible to tricks and offensives themselves, and most of their appearances ends with them getting arrested. They are usually imprisoned in [[Duckburg]] prisons or [[Sing Sing]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++24-01|title=The Twenty-four Carat Moon|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> but they have also been jailed in other prisons as well. The Beagle Boys are however proud of their criminal background; never willing to live their lives in accordance to the [[law]].\n\nThe Beagle Boys' main goal for stealing Scrooge McDuck's money is so they can create a paradisiacal life of luxury for themselves. On few occasions when they have managed to steal the money they are shown to spend it all very wastefully and in excess; like buying extravagant and ostentatious mansions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++42-02&search=Case%2520of%2520the%2520Sticky%2520Money|title=The Case of the Sticky Money|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> or living on a paradise island near [[Hawaii]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US++++4-02|title=The Menehune Mystery|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> They have also shown proneness for taking over the world when being presented with such an opportunity, like in Carl Barks' story ''The Mysterious Stone Ray'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #8, 1954).\n\n[[File:The Fantastic River Race.jpg|thumb|left|Blackheart Beagle and his three sons, from \"The Fantastic River Race\" (1957).]]\nThe Beagle Boys are most often shown without an established leader, instead acting as a very coherent and homogeneous unit, and only gives orders between each other interchangeably when needed. However, sometimes the Beagle Boys are led by their grandfather, '''Blackheart Beagle''', who has the prison number 186\u2013802. The Blackheart character originates from two characters created by Carl Barks: Blackheart Beagle, a riverboat pirate from ''The Fantastic River Race'' (''Uncle Scrooge goes to Disneyland'' #1, 1957) and '''Grandpa Beagle''', who appeared in ''[[The Money Well]]'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #21, 1958). It was [[Don Rosa]] who later combined the character into one in chapters 10 and 11 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. Also according to Rosa, Blackheart Beagle semi-retired in 1947, following a failed attempt at robbing Scrooge's Money Bin. In ''The'' ''Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'', Scrooge first met The Beagle Boys in his [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[riverboat]] days, circa 1880. Those Beagle Boys included Blackheart Beagle and his three sons.\n\nScrooge first met the modern third generation Beagle Boys during Christmas 1947, which was when he first met his grandnephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] and met his nephew [[Donald Duck]] for the second time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+93488|title=The Recluse Of McDuck Manor|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> Since then the Beagle Boys have been a constant threat to Scrooge's [[Money Bin]].\n\n[[File:Grandpa Beagle The Money Well.jpg|thumb|left|Grandpa Beagle from \"The Money Well\" (1958).]]\nThe third generation of the Beagle Boys, like their fathers, were never given any personal names by Carl Barks but was instead referred to by their prison numbers, which starts with \"176-\" and ends on a permutation of the numbers 1, 6 and 7, which allows six different combinations. This tradition was first established in Barks' ''[[The Menehune Mystery]]'' (Uncle Scrooge #4, December 1953), while the Beagle Boys in previous stories, and some of them in ''The Menehune Mystery,'' instead had their prison numbers as \"176-\" followed by random digits (except in their first story, where they have no prison numbers). However, in a few of his later stories Barks didn't continue this tradition and used random numbers again instead, but subsequent writers and artists by default still mostly uses the 1, 6 and 7 combinations for the Beagle Boys in the modern comic books. The Beagle Boys also have their prison numbers tattooed on their chests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++42-02&search=the%2520case%2520of%2520the%2520sticky%2520money|title=The Case of the Sticky Money|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> According to Don Rosa's ''[[The Beagle Boys vs. The Money Bin]]'' (2001), the Beagle Boys have been known by their prison numbers since their childhood, and they don't even know their real names themselves. Their parents do know their real names, but demand a [[bribe]] from their sons to let them know. Also according to that story, Blackheart Beagle doesn't remember his sons' names.\n\nCarl Barks used to include the words \"Beagle Boys, Inc.\" on their shirts under their numbers, which was later deleted in reprints. It can either be assumed that it was a reference to [[Murder, Inc.]], a name for organized crime groups in the 1930s and 40s; or that they are a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] very similar to a real [[business]], but neither is certain. In one comic the Beagle Boys have a worldwide organization known as Beagles International, in which the Beagles have spies in different countries around the world.\n\nIn most of Carl Barks stories the number of Beagle Boys was not exact but instead they were depicted as being ambiguously numerous, with their number of members varying from story to story. However, if one would count all of the different combinations of the Beagle Boys' prison numbers that was used in the comic books by Carl Barks; the Beagle Boys would seem to consist of at least 36 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/creator.php?c1=date&c=CB|title=Carl Barks|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> In ''The Menehune Mystery'', Scrooge mentions thirty Beagle Boys. Don Rosa, however, constantly uses seven Beagle Boys in his stories but instead of using a random number Rosa always hides one prison numbers behind something to avoid two Beagle Boys having the same number.\n\nThe Beagle Boys usually operate on their own, but collaborated with [[Magica De Spell]] in the 1963 Barks story ''Isle of the Golden Geese'', and again in the 1997 Don Rosa story ''[[A Little Something Special]]'' where they also teamed up with [[Flintheart Glomgold]]. In ''The Status Seeker'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #41, 1963) by Carl Barks, they are shown to be part of a [[Trade union|labor union]] called the \"Burglars, Thugs, and Pirates Union\", at Local No. 6<sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub>.\n\n===Other comics===\n[[File:Walt Disney The Beagle Boys.jpeg|thumb|left|230px|''The Beagle Boys''#3 (1966).]]\nFrom 1964 to 1979 the Beagle Boys had their own comic book title, ''The Beagle Boys'', published by [[Gold Key Comics]], which continued from 1979 to 1980 under the name ''The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge.''\n\nIn all comics, the individual Beagle Boys are referred to by their prison numbers as per Barks's convention. In addition to Barks's and Rosa's claim that the Beagle Boys don't know their names, the Beagle Boys-centric comic ''Being Donald Duck'' (2003) by Olaf Moriarty Solstrand adds that the Beagle Boys don't know their mother's name either, only her number. The Beagle Boys' prison numbers are indicated on the tags seen on the chests of their distinctive orange or red turtleneck sweaters. The original depictions by Barks in American comics most often showed the Beagle Boys with orange sweaters. European comics recolored these same Barks drawings to show Beagle Boys in red sweaters. Subsequent European comic depictions of the Beagle Boys by artists other than Barks also showed them in red sweaters, as did the ''[[DuckTales]]'' cartoons.\n\n[[File:Italian Grandpa Beagle.jpg|thumb|180px|Grandpa Beagle as seen in the Italian comic books.]]\nIn later years, especially in Europe, they appear in the comics as a trio, alongside cousins and other relatives of various talents as spin-off characters. Most notably are the Beagle Brats, the Beagle Boys' three preteen nephews created by [[Tony Strobl]] and Steve Steere in ''That Motherly Feeling'' (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #299, 1965). They mirror criminal versions of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey and Louie]] and have the prison numbers 1, 2 and 3. Another prominent relative is Intellectual-176 (or I-176, for short), the Beagle Boys' cousin who acts as the brains of the Beagle clan. He wears a mortar-board cap and glasses over his black bandit mask and has the prison number \"I-176\". I-176 was created by Pete Alvarado and first appeared in ''The Crown Jewel Job'' (''The Beagle Boys'' #7, 1967).\n\nThe Beagle Boys generally live in a small tumbledown hide-out in Duckburg; in 1980s American-produced stories, their pet cat Ratty often lived there as well. In the [[Italy|Italian]] stories they live in a [[travel trailer]] and are sometimes accompanied by their pet [[dachshund]], 64, who shares their criminal mindset, but it is often overcome with 64's constant, voracious appetite.\n\nSometimes they team up with other villains such as Magica De Spell, [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]], [[Mad Madam Mim]], or hire out their services to [[Flintheart Glomgold]], [[John D. Rockerduck]] or Jolly Ollie Eiderduck.<ref>''Christmas in Duckburg'', 1958, written by [[Bob Gregory (comics)|Bob Gregory]] and drawn by [[Carl Barks]]</ref> During these occasions they continue to operate out of their own interests rather than their employers'.\n\nMany other authors use a character purely based on ''The Money Well'' version as the Beagle Boys' grandfather. In particular, [[Italy|Italian]] authors use a \"Grandpa Beagle\" who differs from Blackheart in being much skinnier and constantly smoking a pipe. Unlike his grandsons, he is highly intelligent and appears as their cunning and capable leader, hatching devious plans. The Italian version of Grandpa Beagle has the word \"GRAZIA\" where his prison number should be. When his stories are translated for the US, \"GRAZIA\" is replaced with \"186-802\", his prison number in Western stories.\n\nSometimes the Beagle Boys antagonize [[Super Goof]], [[Mickey Mouse]], or some other characters from [[Walt Disney]]'s [[comic book]]s.\n\n===Ottoperotto===\n[[File:Ottoperotto(BeagleBoys).png|thumb|150px|His favorite activity is eating sausages.]]\n'''Ottoperotto''' ([[univerbation]] of {{lang|it|otto per otto}}, {{langnf||Italian|\"8\u00d78\"}}) is the Beagle Boys' pet dachshund in Italian comic book stories. The joke about him being a dachshund is that in Italy the Beagle Boys are referred to as \"Banda Bassotti\", which means \"Dachshund Gang\". Like his masters, Ottoperotto wears a bandit mask, a shirt and a cap, marked with the number [[64 (number)|64]] (the result of the 8\u00d78 multiplication). The Beagle Boys frequently take Ottoperotto along on their [[robbery|robberies]], to act as a guard dog and to reach spaces too small for the Beagle Boys themselves. However, the plans are often spoiled by Ottoperotto's constant, voracious appetite. Whenever Ottoperotto smells food, he abandons everything else to get to eat it.\n\n==The Beagle Boys in animation==\n===''Sport Goofy in Soccermania''===\nThe Beagle Boys made their animated debut in the 1987 [[Goofy]] short ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'', voiced by [[Will Ryan]]. Unlike their ''[[DuckTales]]'' incarnations, the Beagle Boys are depicted as identical in both appearance and behavior, though lacking the prison numbers of their comic counterparts.\n\n===''DuckTales''===\n[[File:Beaglefamily.png|thumb|A Beagle family photo, as seen in ''DuckTales''. From left to right: Burger, Baggy, Bouncer, Bigtime, Ma Beagle, Bugle, Bankjob, and Babyface.]]\nOn ''DuckTales'', the Beagle Boys were given [[List of DuckTales characters#Beagle Boys|names and different personalities]]. The usual character combination is Bigtime, Burger, and either Bouncer or Baggy, with Bouncer appearing more often in the first season and Baggy in the second. Their leader is usually Bigtime when [[Ma Beagle]] is not present. Sometimes one or two of them were swapped out with Bankjob, Babyface or Bugle, and a few episodes featured the latter three as the trio of Beagles, with Bankjob filling in for Bigtime as the leader. Other known names are Bomber and Blitzkrieg. The letter [[B]] is the first initial of all Beagle Boys' handles except Megabyte, the brains of the bunch.\n\nThe Beagle Boys have lots of relatives who count each other as brothers and cousins: apart from Ma Beagle, there are re-imagined versions of the Beagle Brats (sons or nephews), as well as the Beagle Babes (a female counterpart).\n\nThe Beagle Boys make cameos in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode \"In Like Blunt\", where they are among the villains bidding on a list of SHUSH's secret agents.\n\n====Ma Beagle====\n'''Ma Beagle''', based on the real-life [[Ma Barker]] and the mystifications around her, was a new character created for ''DuckTales'' as the mother of the seven common Beagle Boys featured on the show, and the clan [[matriarch]]. She often smuggles [[hand grenade]]s, [[chainsaw]]s, and other tools in baked goods which easily pass [[prison]] security to help her sons escape from [[Prison|jail]]. Even when she is around, the Beagles never succeed because [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his nephews always outwit them. However, in most of the episodes she appears in (especially in the first season), she is able to avoid being arrested along with her sons; that way, she will be able to bust them out the next time she appears. In one episode, she pretended to be \"married\" to Scrooge so that she could steal his fortune, but her plans were thwarted by both him and his [[Huey, Dewey and Louie|nephews]]. With Ma, family always comes first - except when it comes to avoiding arrest. She was voiced by actress [[June Foray]], who also voiced [[Magica De Spell]]. [[Margo Martindale]] voices Ma in the 2017 ''Ducktales'' series.\n\nMa Beagle first appeared in the episode \"Robot Robbers\", and since then she has become a recurring character. She appeared more frequently in the second season than in the first, however.\n\n====1987 Series Beagles====\nThere were many Beagle Boys on the [[DuckTales|1987 original series]], but the most common seven consisted of:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#EFEFEF\"\n|'''Name'''\n|'''Placard Number'''\n|'''Characteristics'''\n|-\n|'''Bigtime Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/big-time-beagle/|title=Bigtime Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|167-671\n|Bigtime is the second-in-command, being the leader of the group in absence of Ma Beagle, and is distinguished by being rather short for someone with the word \"Big\" in his name. He is the smartest of the seven main Beagles and often has to correct his companions whenever they get something wrong and mishear his directions. Voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n|-\n|'''Burger Beagle'''\n|761-176 or 176-761\n|As his name suggests, Burger has a large appetite, although it is for more than just hamburgers. He has a habit of talking about food no matter if any of the others are actually talking about it. His prison tag is often seen with a bite taken out of it. He also isn't very bright. Incidentally, his comic counterpart (who had the second placard number) is known for a special appreciation for prunes and his curious culinary tastes (i.e. catsup on ice cream or peanut butter pizza with gravy). Voiced by [[Chuck McCann]].\n|-\n|'''Bouncer Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/bouncer-beagle/|title=Bouncer Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|716-167\n|Distinguishable for his teeth, one of which is missing, Bouncer is the strongest Beagle after Bankjob. In earlier episodes before their names were well established, Bouncer sometimes had Burger's voice and vice versa. He appeared much less frequently in the second season, most likely because he was in jail as mentioned by Ma Beagle in one episode. In the GameCube version of the video game \"Donald Duck Goin' Quackers!\", during the Beagle Boys boss battle, when Donald Duck fights Bigtime, Burger, and Bouncer, all three of them have the same number on Bouncer's shirt. Voiced by Chuck McCann.\n|-\n|'''Baggy Beagle'''\n|617-716\n|Baggy is distinguishable for his silly grin as well as his loose-fitting clothing. His prison tag is often seen with a fold in one the corners. He is the least intelligent and the most sloppy of the Beagle Boys. He appeared more frequently in the second season and somewhat replaced Bouncer as third beagle in the usual trio of himself, Bigtime and Burger. Voiced by Frank Welker.\n|-\n|'''Bankjob Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/bankjob-beagle/|title=Bankjob Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|671-167 or 614-167\n|Bankjob is the third-in-command of the Beagle Boys, as he usually leads the group in episodes where Bigtime isn't present. He is the largest of the seven main Beagles (by comparison, he is about the same size as Launchpad), and the strongest. In the second season he had no speaking roles and rarely appeared. Voiced by [[Peter Cullen]].\n|-\n|'''Bugle/Bebop Beagle'''\n|671-761\n|Bugle, or Bebop, depending on the episode, is the beatnik member of the Beagle Boys (despite the fact that the comic Beagle with this character trait corresponds by placard to Babyface), and even dresses in a jazz-styled outfit. Had no speaking roles in season two. Voiced by [[Brian Cummings]].\n|-\n|'''Babyface Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/babyface-beagle/|title=Babyface Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|176-167\n|As his name suggests, Babyface is the youngest of the primary Beagles, as evidenced by the fact that his own clothing matches those of a baby, including a [[propeller beanie]] in place of the usual hat. He's also rather short yet slightly taller than Bigtime. In spite of this, his voice, provided by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] (who also voices [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]]), sounds more manly than that of Burger. Strangely, one particular comic story in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' prominently featured Babyface, wherein he infiltrated [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]]'s class. But he looked different from how he did on the show, and he also had a conscience, as he ended up rebelling against his brothers during a field trip to Scrooge's Money Bin. (He still ended up being arrested along with his brothers, though.) Like Bankjob and Bebop, his role was reduced to non-speaking cameos in the second season.\n|-\n|}\n'''Other Beagle Boys consisted of''':\n* '''Megabyte Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/megabyte-beagle/|title=Megabyte Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> is the most intelligent engineering genius of the clan, and the only one whose name doesn't begin with the letter \"B\". He appeared in the five-part serial ''Super DuckTales'', in which he made a remote control to control [[GizmoDuck]]. He has a habit of confusing his companions with his technobabble, forcing them to make him \"say it in Beagle talk!\". Ma Beagle comments that paying his college fees with stolen money paid off. His voice was done by [[Frank Welker]].\n* '''Bomber Beagle''' looks a lot like Bankjob in that he has a similar jawline and is very large. He appears in less episodes and is more intelligent than most of the other brothers. He is also a skilled pilot as seen in the episode \"Top Duck\" (episode 16).\n* '''Backwoods Beagle''' is a small beagle about the size of Bigtime and Babyface, and the only Beagle who wears a full moustache. He has a strong Canadian accent and is the twin brother of Binky Beagle and Bacon Beagle. Backwoods wears a Davy Crocket-like trapper's outfit as opposed to the normal jailhouse outfit of the Beagleboys. He is also the only person who is able to understand Bacon Beagle.\n* '''Binky Beagle''' is a probably the only Beagle Boy who is never seen speaking. He is roughly the same size as Baggy Beagle, wears a lumberjack outfit and has a full beard.

When Glomgold asked how he could be a Beagle Boy, Backwoods explains that Bacon had a bad case of the [[swine flu]] as a child.

In the season two episode, \"The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot!\", it is revealed that the feud between them and Scrooge McDuck originated from a battle between [[Cornelius Coot]] (the founder of Duckburg and ancestor of [[Donald Duck]]) and the Beagles of that time; wherein the latter attempted to attack a fort the former was holding, only to be tricked into surrendering and/or retreating when Coot used popcorn makers to make the Beagles think he was everywhere at once. The fort would go on to become Fort Duckburg, and strike up the feud for control of the land it was on, which the Beagles claim should be called \"Beagleburg\".\n* '''Ma Beagle''' - Ringleader of all of the Beagle Boys and the owner of their junkyard home. \n* '''The Original Classics''' \u2013 The Original Classics, consisting of Bigtime, Burger, and Bouncer Beagle, who debuted in the episode \"Daytrip of Doom!\" They depart drastically from their 1987 counterparts in that Burger is tall, skinny, and mute; Bigtime is dumber than his original counterpart and has delusions of grandeur; and Bouncer is now the same size as the 1987 Bankjob.\n* '''The Glam Yankees''' \u2013 A trio of [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] [[Yankee]]/[[glam rock]]-themed Beagle Boys.\n* '''The D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vus''' \u2013 A trio of French-themed Beagle Boys whose name provides a gag in the episode \"The Beagle Birthday Massacre\" as they are introduced by Ma Beagle three times, similar to real world [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]].\n* '''The 6th Avenue Meanies''' \u2013 A trio of thuggish, brutish Beagle Boys led by '''Bad Attitude Beagle'''.\n* '''The 6th Avenue Friendlies''' \u2013 A trio of [[Gentleman thief|well-mannered, dapper]] Beagle Boys led by '''Benevolent Beagle'''.\n* '''The Longboard Taquitos''' \u2013 A trio of daredevil Beagle Boys who ride on skateboards, wear wing-suits, and speak with \"surfer dude\" accents.\n* '''The Tumblebums''' \u2013 A trio of Gothic circus Beagle Boys, consisting of a muscular clown, a stilt-walker, and an acrobat.

They decide to depose [[Minnie Mouse|Princess Minnie]] so Pete could become king. They were shown to be much more competent and dangerous compared to their ''DuckTales'' counterparts.

Created by [[Carl Barks]], they are a family clan of [[Organized crime|organized criminals]] who constantly try to rob [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Their introduction and first appearance was in ''Terror of the Beagle Boys'' (''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #134, November 1951), although in this story they only appear in the last frame and have no lines. They appear again in the next issue in a similar fashion, in ''The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill'' (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #135, December 1951).\n\n==The Beagle Boys in comics==\n===Barks/Rosa universe===\nThe Beagle Boys were originally created by [[Carl Barks]], and made their first appearance in the 10-page story ''The Terror of the Beagle Boys'' (WDC #134) that was first published in November 1951. Although the Beagle Boys are only shown very briefly on the last page of this story, it is implied that Scrooge has known about them for a long time. The Beagle Boys are usually depicted as a gang of about three to ten members or more depending on the story, who are identical in appearance and personality. They wear black bandit masks to hide their identities and on their turtleneck sweaters, most often being orange or red, they have their prison number signs. The Beagle Boys are often characterized to be very crude, boastful, aggravating, greedy and self-centered \u2014 among themselves however, they are very loyal and have a strong connection of sibling camaraderie. Although, on some occasions they have shown irritation toward each other, often relating to someone making a mistake or saying something that doesn't fit in with the consensus, like one Beagle Boy's (176-167) overly fondness of [[prune]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US++++8-02|title=The Mysterious Stone Ray|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++58-02|title=The Giant Robot Robbers|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> a weakness that proves to be the Beagle Boys' downfall in some stories. 176-167's love for prunes makes him the only Beagle Boy with a unique characteristic.\n\nThe first story to feature the Beagle Boys in a major role is ''[[Only a Poor Old Man]]'' (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #1, March 1952), which serves as a template for virtually all future Beagle Boys appearances, and establishes them as a serious threat to Scrooge's fortune. In the same story they are called \"''the most awful gang of crooks in the country\"'' by [[Donald Duck]]. This most often manifests with them cleverly coming up with various and elaborate schemes to try to break into and steal from Scrooge McDuck's well secured [[Money Bin]]. On occasion they are even shown to have highly intellectual capacities, as they are able to earn [[academic degree]]s in various fields. Among individual Beagle Boys, some of these degrees include: [[Electroencephalography|cranial encephalography]], [[psychology]], [[chemistry]], [[metallurgy]] and electropyrotechnology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++63-02&redirected=1|title=House of Haunts|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> These were often seen by the [[Federal government of the United States|government]] as attempts at [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], but in reality it was a charade by the Beagle Boys to use their newly acquired skills for robberies. They are also experts at trickery, including [[disguise]]s, and [[animal training]]; like using [[cormorant]]s as [[Bomber|aerial bombers]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++386-02|title=Only A Poor Old Man|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> as well as having a large arsenal of various weapons, explosives and machines. When needed, they have been shown to be able to use force or threats to get what they want. With all things considered however, the Beagle Boys are often attributed not to be as clever they think they are, often gullible to tricks and offensives themselves, and most of their appearances ends with them getting arrested. They are usually imprisoned in [[Duckburg]] prisons or [[Sing Sing]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++24-01|title=The Twenty-four Carat Moon|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> but they have also been jailed in other prisons as well. The Beagle Boys are however proud of their criminal background; never willing to live their lives in accordance to the [[law]].\n\nThe Beagle Boys' main goal for stealing Scrooge McDuck's money is so they can create a paradisiacal life of luxury for themselves. On few occasions when they have managed to steal the money they are shown to spend it all very wastefully and in excess; like buying extravagant and ostentatious mansions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++42-02&search=Case%2520of%2520the%2520Sticky%2520Money|title=The Case of the Sticky Money|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> or living on a paradise island near [[Hawaii]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US++++4-02|title=The Menehune Mystery|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref> They have also shown proneness for taking over the world when being presented with such an opportunity, like in Carl Barks' story ''The Mysterious Stone Ray'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #8, 1954).\n\n[[File:The Fantastic River Race.jpg|thumb|left|Blackheart Beagle and his three sons, from \"The Fantastic River Race\" (1957).]]\nThe Beagle Boys are most often shown without an established leader, instead acting as a very coherent and homogeneous unit, and only gives orders between each other interchangeably when needed. However, sometimes the Beagle Boys are led by their grandfather, '''Blackheart Beagle''', who has the prison number 186\u2013802. The Blackheart character originates from two characters created by Carl Barks: Blackheart Beagle, a riverboat pirate from ''The Fantastic River Race'' (''Uncle Scrooge goes to Disneyland'' #1, 1957) and '''Grandpa Beagle''', who appeared in ''[[The Money Well]]'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #21, 1958). It was [[Don Rosa]] who later combined the character into one in chapters 10 and 11 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. Also according to Rosa, Blackheart Beagle semi-retired in 1947, following a failed attempt at robbing Scrooge's Money Bin. In ''The'' ''Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'', Scrooge first met The Beagle Boys in his [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[riverboat]] days, circa 1880. Those Beagle Boys included Blackheart Beagle and his three sons.\n\nScrooge first met the modern third generation Beagle Boys during Christmas 1947, which was when he first met his grandnephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] and met his nephew [[Donald Duck]] for the second time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+93488|title=The Recluse Of McDuck Manor|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> Since then the Beagle Boys have been a constant threat to Scrooge's [[Money Bin]].\n\n[[File:Grandpa Beagle The Money Well.jpg|thumb|left|Grandpa Beagle from \"The Money Well\" (1958).]]\nThe third generation of the Beagle Boys, like their fathers, were never given any personal names by Carl Barks but was instead referred to by their prison numbers, which starts with \"176-\" and ends on a permutation of the numbers 1, 6 and 7, which allows six different combinations. This tradition was first established in Barks' ''[[The Menehune Mystery]]'' (Uncle Scrooge #4, December 1953), while the Beagle Boys in previous stories, and some of them in ''The Menehune Mystery,'' instead had their prison numbers as \"176-\" followed by random digits (except in their first story, where they have no prison numbers). However, in a few of his later stories Barks didn't continue this tradition and used random numbers again instead, but subsequent writers and artists by default still mostly uses the 1, 6 and 7 combinations for the Beagle Boys in the modern comic books. The Beagle Boys also have their prison numbers tattooed on their chests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++42-02&search=the%2520case%2520of%2520the%2520sticky%2520money|title=The Case of the Sticky Money|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> According to Don Rosa's ''[[The Beagle Boys vs. The Money Bin]]'' (2001), the Beagle Boys have been known by their prison numbers since their childhood, and they don't even know their real names themselves. Their parents do know their real names, but demand a [[bribe]] from their sons to let them know. Also according to that story, Blackheart Beagle doesn't remember his sons' names.\n\nCarl Barks used to include the words \"Beagle Boys, Inc.\" on their shirts under their numbers, which was later deleted in reprints. It can either be assumed that it was a reference to [[Murder, Inc.]], a name for organized crime groups in the 1930s and 40s; or that they are a [[Organized crime|criminal organization]] very similar to a real [[business]], but neither is certain. In one comic the Beagle Boys have a worldwide organization known as Beagles International, in which the Beagles have spies in different countries around the world.\n\nIn most of Carl Barks stories the number of Beagle Boys was not exact but instead they were depicted as being ambiguously numerous, with their number of members varying from story to story. However, if one would count all of the different combinations of the Beagle Boys' prison numbers that was used in the comic books by Carl Barks; the Beagle Boys would seem to consist of at least 36 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/creator.php?c1=date&c=CB|title=Carl Barks|website=coa.inducks.org|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> In ''The Menehune Mystery'', Scrooge mentions thirty Beagle Boys. Don Rosa, however, constantly uses seven Beagle Boys in his stories but instead of using a random number Rosa always hides one prison numbers behind something to avoid two Beagle Boys having the same number.\n\nThe Beagle Boys usually operate on their own, but collaborated with [[Magica De Spell]] in the 1963 Barks story ''Isle of the Golden Geese'', and again in the 1997 Don Rosa story ''[[A Little Something Special]]'' where they also teamed up with [[Flintheart Glomgold]]. In ''The Status Seeker'' (''Uncle Scrooge'' #41, 1963) by Carl Barks, they are shown to be part of a [[Trade union|labor union]] called the \"Burglars, Thugs, and Pirates Union\", at Local No. 6<sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub>.\n\n===Other comics===\n[[File:Walt Disney The Beagle Boys.jpeg|thumb|left|230px|''The Beagle Boys''#3 (1966).]]\nFrom 1964 to 1979 the Beagle Boys had their own comic book title, ''The Beagle Boys'', published by [[Gold Key Comics]], which continued from 1979 to 1980 under the name ''The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge.''\n\nIn all comics, the individual Beagle Boys are referred to by their prison numbers as per Barks's convention. In addition to Barks's and Rosa's claim that the Beagle Boys don't know their names, the Beagle Boys-centric comic ''Being Donald Duck'' (2003) by Olaf Moriarty Solstrand adds that the Beagle Boys don't know their mother's name either, only her number. The Beagle Boys' prison numbers are indicated on the tags seen on the chests of their distinctive orange or red turtleneck sweaters. The original depictions by Barks in American comics most often showed the Beagle Boys with orange sweaters. European comics recolored these same Barks drawings to show Beagle Boys in red sweaters. Subsequent European comic depictions of the Beagle Boys by artists other than Barks also showed them in red sweaters, as did the ''[[DuckTales]]'' cartoons.\n\n[[File:Italian Grandpa Beagle.jpg|thumb|180px|Grandpa Beagle as seen in the Italian comic books.]]\nIn later years, especially in Europe, they appear in the comics as a trio, alongside cousins and other relatives of various talents as spin-off characters. Most notably are the Beagle Brats, the Beagle Boys' three preteen nephews created by [[Tony Strobl]] and Steve Steere in ''That Motherly Feeling'' (''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #299, 1965). They mirror criminal versions of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey and Louie]] and have the prison numbers 1, 2 and 3. Another prominent relative is Intellectual-176 (or I-176, for short), the Beagle Boys' cousin who acts as the brains of the Beagle clan. He wears a mortar-board cap and glasses over his black bandit mask and has the prison number \"I-176\". I-176 was created by Pete Alvarado and first appeared in ''The Crown Jewel Job'' (''The Beagle Boys'' #7, 1967).\n\nThe Beagle Boys generally live in a small tumbledown hide-out in Duckburg; in 1980s American-produced stories, their pet cat Ratty often lived there as well. In the [[Italy|Italian]] stories they live in a [[travel trailer]] and are sometimes accompanied by their pet [[dachshund]], 64, who shares their criminal mindset, but it is often overcome with 64's constant, voracious appetite.\n\nSometimes they team up with other villains such as Magica De Spell, [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]], [[Mad Madam Mim]], or hire out their services to [[Flintheart Glomgold]], [[John D. Rockerduck]] or Jolly Ollie Eiderduck.<ref>''Christmas in Duckburg'', 1958, written by [[Bob Gregory (comics)|Bob Gregory]] and drawn by [[Carl Barks]]</ref> During these occasions they continue to operate out of their own interests rather than their employers'.\n\nMany other authors use a character purely based on ''The Money Well'' version as the Beagle Boys' grandfather. In particular, [[Italy|Italian]] authors use a \"Grandpa Beagle\" who differs from Blackheart in being much skinnier and constantly smoking a pipe. Unlike his grandsons, he is highly intelligent and appears as their cunning and capable leader, hatching devious plans. The Italian version of Grandpa Beagle has the word \"GRAZIA\" where his prison number should be. When his stories are translated for the US, \"GRAZIA\" is replaced with \"186-802\", his prison number in Western stories.\n\nSometimes the Beagle Boys antagonize [[Super Goof]], [[Mickey Mouse]], or some other characters from [[Walt Disney]]'s [[comic book]]s.\n\n===Ottoperotto===\n[[File:Ottoperotto(BeagleBoys).png|thumb|150px|His favorite activity is eating sausages.]]\n'''Ottoperotto''' ([[univerbation]] of {{lang|it|otto per otto}}, {{langnf||Italian|\"8\u00d78\"}}) is the Beagle Boys' pet dachshund in Italian comic book stories. The joke about him being a dachshund is that in Italy the Beagle Boys are referred to as \"Banda Bassotti\", which means \"Dachshund Gang\". Like his masters, Ottoperotto wears a bandit mask, a shirt and a cap, marked with the number [[64 (number)|64]] (the result of the 8\u00d78 multiplication). The Beagle Boys frequently take Ottoperotto along on their [[robbery|robberies]], to act as a guard dog and to reach spaces too small for the Beagle Boys themselves. However, the plans are often spoiled by Ottoperotto's constant, voracious appetite. Whenever Ottoperotto smells food, he abandons everything else to get to eat it.\n\n==The Beagle Boys in animation==\n===''Sport Goofy in Soccermania''===\nThe Beagle Boys made their animated debut in the 1987 [[Goofy]] short ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'', voiced by [[Will Ryan]]. Unlike their ''[[DuckTales]]'' incarnations, the Beagle Boys are depicted as identical in both appearance and behavior, though lacking the prison numbers of their comic counterparts.\n\n===''DuckTales''===\n[[File:Beaglefamily.png|thumb|A Beagle family photo, as seen in ''DuckTales''. From left to right: Burger, Baggy, Bouncer, Bigtime, Ma Beagle, Bugle, Bankjob, and Babyface.]]\nOn ''DuckTales'', the Beagle Boys were given [[List of DuckTales characters#Beagle Boys|names and different personalities]]. The usual character combination is Bigtime, Burger, and either Bouncer or Baggy, with Bouncer appearing more often in the first season and Baggy in the second. Their leader is usually Bigtime when [[Ma Beagle]] is not present. Sometimes one or two of them were swapped out with Bankjob, Babyface or Bugle, and a few episodes featured the latter three as the trio of Beagles, with Bankjob filling in for Bigtime as the leader. Other known names are Bomber and Blitzkrieg. The letter [[B]] is the first initial of all Beagle Boys' handles except Megabyte, the brains of the bunch.\n\nThe Beagle Boys have lots of relatives who count each other as brothers and cousins: apart from Ma Beagle, there are re-imagined versions of the Beagle Brats (sons or nephews), as well as the Beagle Babes (a female counterpart).\n\nThe Beagle Boys make cameos in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode \"In Like Blunt\", where they are among the villains bidding on a list of SHUSH's secret agents.\n\n====Ma Beagle====\n'''Ma Beagle''', based on the real-life [[Ma Barker]] and the mystifications around her, was a new character created for ''DuckTales'' as the mother of the seven common Beagle Boys featured on the show, and the clan [[matriarch]]. She often smuggles [[hand grenade]]s, [[chainsaw]]s, and other tools in baked goods which easily pass [[prison]] security to help her sons escape from [[Prison|jail]]. Even when she is around, the Beagles never succeed because [[Scrooge McDuck]] and his nephews always outwit them. However, in most of the episodes she appears in (especially in the first season), she is able to avoid being arrested along with her sons; that way, she will be able to bust them out the next time she appears. In one episode, she pretended to be \"married\" to Scrooge so that she could steal his fortune, but her plans were thwarted by both him and his [[Huey, Dewey and Louie|nephews]]. With Ma, family always comes first - except when it comes to avoiding arrest. She was voiced by actress [[June Foray]], who also voiced [[Magica De Spell]]. [[Margo Martindale]] voices Ma in the 2017 ''Ducktales'' series.\n\nMa Beagle first appeared in the episode \"Robot Robbers\", and since then she has become a recurring character. She appeared more frequently in the second season than in the first, however.\n\n====1987 Series Beagles====\nThere were many Beagle Boys on the [[DuckTales|1987 original series]], but the most common seven consisted of:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#EFEFEF\"\n|'''Name'''\n|'''Placard Number'''\n|'''Characteristics'''\n|-\n|'''Bigtime Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/big-time-beagle/|title=Bigtime Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|167-671\n|Bigtime is the second-in-command, being the leader of the group in absence of Ma Beagle, and is distinguished by being rather short for someone with the word \"Big\" in his name. He is the smartest of the seven main Beagles and often has to correct his companions whenever they get something wrong and mishear his directions. Voiced by [[Frank Welker]].\n|-\n|'''Burger Beagle'''\n|761-176 or 176-761\n|As his name suggests, Burger has a large appetite, although it is for more than just hamburgers. He has a habit of talking about food no matter if any of the others are actually talking about it. His prison tag is often seen with a bite taken out of it. He also isn't very bright. Incidentally, his comic counterpart (who had the second placard number) is known for a special appreciation for prunes and his curious culinary tastes (i.e. catsup on ice cream or peanut butter pizza with gravy). Voiced by [[Chuck McCann]].\n|-\n|'''Bouncer Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/bouncer-beagle/|title=Bouncer Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|716-167\n|Distinguishable for his teeth, one of which is missing, Bouncer is the strongest Beagle after Bankjob. In earlier episodes before their names were well established, Bouncer sometimes had Burger's voice and vice versa. He appeared much less frequently in the second season, most likely because he was in jail as mentioned by Ma Beagle in one episode. In the GameCube version of the video game \"Donald Duck Goin' Quackers!\", during the Beagle Boys boss battle, when Donald Duck fights Bigtime, Burger, and Bouncer, all three of them have the same number on Bouncer's shirt. Voiced by Chuck McCann.\n|-\n|'''Baggy Beagle'''\n|617-716\n|Baggy is distinguishable for his silly grin as well as his loose-fitting clothing. His prison tag is often seen with a fold in one the corners. He is the least intelligent and the most sloppy of the Beagle Boys. He appeared more frequently in the second season and somewhat replaced Bouncer as third beagle in the usual trio of himself, Bigtime and Burger. Voiced by Frank Welker.\n|-\n|'''Bankjob Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/bankjob-beagle/|title=Bankjob Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|671-167 or 614-167\n|Bankjob is the third-in-command of the Beagle Boys, as he usually leads the group in episodes where Bigtime isn't present. He is the largest of the seven main Beagles (by comparison, he is about the same size as Launchpad), and the strongest. In the second season he had no speaking roles and rarely appeared. Voiced by [[Peter Cullen]].\n|-\n|'''Bugle/Bebop Beagle'''\n|671-761\n|Bugle, or Bebop, depending on the episode, is the beatnik member of the Beagle Boys (despite the fact that the comic Beagle with this character trait corresponds by placard to Babyface), and even dresses in a jazz-styled outfit. Had no speaking roles in season two. Voiced by [[Brian Cummings]].\n|-\n|'''Babyface Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/babyface-beagle/|title=Babyface Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n|176-167\n|As his name suggests, Babyface is the youngest of the primary Beagles, as evidenced by the fact that his own clothing matches those of a baby, including a [[propeller beanie]] in place of the usual hat. He's also rather short yet slightly taller than Bigtime. In spite of this, his voice, provided by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]] (who also voices [[Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad]]), sounds more manly than that of Burger. Strangely, one particular comic story in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' prominently featured Babyface, wherein he infiltrated [[Webby Vanderquack|Webby]]'s class. But he looked different from how he did on the show, and he also had a conscience, as he ended up rebelling against his brothers during a field trip to Scrooge's Money Bin. (He still ended up being arrested along with his brothers, though.) Like Bankjob and Bebop, his role was reduced to non-speaking cameos in the second season.\n|-\n|}\n'''Other Beagle Boys consisted of''':\n* '''Megabyte Beagle'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/megabyte-beagle/|title=Megabyte Beagle {{!}} Mickey Mouse Athletics|website=mickeymouseathletics.com|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> is the most intelligent engineering genius of the clan, and the only one whose name doesn't begin with the letter \"B\". He appeared in the five-part serial ''Super DuckTales'', in which he made a remote control to control [[GizmoDuck]]. He has a habit of confusing his companions with his technobabble, forcing them to make him \"say it in Beagle talk!\". Ma Beagle comments that paying his college fees with stolen money paid off. His voice was done by [[Frank Welker]].\n* '''Bomber Beagle''' looks a lot like Bankjob in that he has a similar jawline and is very large. He appears in less episodes and is more intelligent than most of the other brothers. He is also a skilled pilot as seen in the episode \"Top Duck\" (episode 16).\n* '''Backwoods Beagle''' is a small beagle about the size of Bigtime and Babyface, and the only Beagle who wears a full moustache. He has a strong Canadian accent and is the twin brother of Binky Beagle and Bacon Beagle. Backwoods wears a Davy Crocket-like trapper's outfit as opposed to the normal jailhouse outfit of the Beagleboys. He is also the only person who is able to understand Bacon Beagle.\n* '''Binky Beagle''' is a probably the only Beagle Boy who is never seen speaking. He is roughly the same size as Baggy Beagle, wears a lumberjack outfit and has a full beard. He lives with Backwoods and Bacon Beagle in the Ducky Mountains.\n* '''Bacon Beagle''' is the only Beagle Boy who is not a Beagle. Bacon is in fact a pig. When Glomgold asked how he could be a Beagle Boy, Backwoods explains that Bacon had a bad case of the [[swine flu]] as a child. Bacon cannot speak, but his oinks and grunts are, instead, translated by Backwoods Beagle.\n* '''Cameo Beagles''':\n** '''Bullseye Beagle'''\n** '''Bulkhead Beagle'''\n** '''Butterball Beagle'''\n** '''Bombshell Beagle'''\n** '''Bankroll Beagle'''\n** '''Brainstorm Beagle'''\n** '''Buns Beagle'''\n** '''Boom Boom Beagle''' ''(Similar to the Beagle Babe)''\n** '''Banzai Beagle'''\n** '''Buckaroo Beagle'''\n** '''Beanball Beagle'''\n** '''Blitzkrieg Beagle'''\n** '''Bifocal Beagle'''\n** '''Bumpkin Beagle'''\n** '''Butter Ball Beagle'''\n** '''Bully Beagle'''\n** '''Bearnaise Beagle''' - A richer version of Burger\n** '''Bicep Beagle''' - A richer version of Bouncer\n** '''Bonaparte Beagle''' - A richer version of Bigtime\n\n====2017 Series Beagles====\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 reboot series]], the Beagle Boys are divided into several smaller gangs, as revealed in the episode \"The Beagle Birthday Massacre!\" and are all voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]; with Ma Beagle serving as the leader of all of them. In the season two episode, \"The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot!\", it's revealed that the feud between them and Scrooge McDuck originated from a battle between [[Cornelius Coot]] (the founder of Duckburg and ancestor of [[Donald Duck]]) and the Beagles of that time; wherein the latter attempted to attack a fort the former was holding, only to be tricked into surrendering and/or retreating when Coot used popcorn makers to make the Beagles think he was everywhere at once. The fort would go on to become Fort Duckburg, and strike up the feud for control of the land it was on, which the Beagles claim should be called \"Beagleburg\".\n* '''Ma Beagle''' - Ringleader of all of the Beagle Boys and the owner of their junkyard home. \n* '''The Original Classics''' \u2013 The Original Classics, consisting of Bigtime, Burger, and Bouncer Beagle, who debuted in the episode \"Daytrip of Doom!\" They depart drastically from their 1987 counterparts in that Burger is tall, skinny, and mute; Bigtime is dumber than his counterpart and has delusions of grandeur; and Bouncer is now the same size as the 1987 Bankjob.\n* '''The Glam Yankees''' \u2013 A trio of [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] [[Yankee]]/[[glam rock]]-themed Beagle Boys.\n* '''The D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vus''' \u2013 A trio of French-themed Beagle Boys whose name provides a gag in the episode \"The Beagle Birthday Massacre\" as they are introduced by Ma Beagle three times, similar to real world [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]].\n* '''The 6th Avenue Meanies''' \u2013 A trio of thuggish, brutish Beagle Boys led by '''Bad Attitude Beagle'''.\n* '''The 6th Avenue Friendlies''' \u2013 A trio of [[Gentleman thief|well-mannered, dapper]] Beagle Boys led by '''Benevolent Beagle'''.\n* '''The Longboard Taquitos''' \u2013 A trio of daredevil Beagle Boys who ride on skateboards, wear wing-suits, and speak with \"surfer dude\" accents.\n* '''The Tumblebums''' \u2013 A trio of Gothic circus Beagle Boys, consisting of a muscular clown, a stilt-walker, and an acrobat. According to the other Beagles, they're rumored to be adopted.\n* '''The Ugly Failures''' \u2013 A trio of unattractive, incompetent Beagle Boys consisting of '''Botched Job''', '''Bungle''', and '''Bottle Beagle'''.\n* '''Black Arts Beagle''' \u2013 A solo Beagle Boy who is a stage magician and differs from the other Beagle Boys by having gray fur instead of tan.\n* '''Broadway''' and '''Backfield Beagle''' - Two Beagle Boys introduced in the ''DuckTales'' comics with a movie director and football theme, respectively.\n* '''Bomber''' and '''Butcher Beagle''' - Two hockey playing Beagles that are also introduced in the ''DuckTales'' comics.\n* '''Grandpappy Beagle''' - Ma Beagle's grandfather who most notably stole the deed to Duckburg before Scrooge stole it from him and crashed the first annual McDuck Enterprises Christmas Party.\n* '''Grandpappy's Gang''' - A trio of Beagle Boys consisting of Bankjob, Babyface, and Bugle Beagle.\n\n===''Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers''===\nThe Beagle Boys appeared as [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]]'s henchmen in the film ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]''. There are only three Beagle Boys in the film, one of them noted for being short (however unlike Big Time he wasn't the leader but more or less the \"idiot\" of the group), with gray skin and black hoods. They decide to depose [[Minnie Mouse|Princess Minnie]] so Pete could become king. They were shown to be much more competent and dangerous compared to their ''DuckTales'' counterparts. These Beagle Boys were collectively voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Maurice LaMarche]].\n\nThese versions of the Beagle Boys appear in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Daltons (Lucky Luke)|The Daltons]], a similarly organised band of comic strip criminal villains\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Inducks character|BB}}\n* [https://mickeymouseathletics.com/player/big-time-beagle/ BigTime Beagle] at [http://mickeymouseathletics.com/ Mickey Mouse Athletics]\n* {{Inducks character|Ma+Beagle|Ma Beagle}}\n* [http://ducktales.aniworld.ru/duckburg/beagles/1.htm Virtual journey in the Beagle Boys' hut]\n\n{{Disney Characters}}\n{{DuckTales}}\n\n[[Category:Disney core universe characters]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic dogs]]\n[[Category:Fictional organized crime groups]]\n[[Category:Fictional henchmen]]\n[[Category:Comic strip villains]]\n[[Category:Disney comics characters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1951]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Calisota]]\n[[Category:Fictional kidnappers]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carl Barks]]\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Disney animated villains]]\n\n[[de:Liste der Bewohner Entenhausens#Panzerknacker]]\n", "name_user": "Blazewing16", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2017 Series Beagles", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_Boys"}
