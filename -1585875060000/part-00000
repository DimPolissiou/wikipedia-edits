It is one of the volcanic peaks in the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], within the High Cascades sector. A prominent landmark for the Rogue River Valley, the mountain is north of [[Mount Shasta]], and [[Crater Lake]] lies to the north-northeast. It was named around 1838 after [[John McLoughlin]], a [[Chief Factor]] for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Mount McLouglin's prominence has made it a landmark to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations for thousands of years.\n\nMcLoughlin consists largely of [[basaltic andesite]]. It underwent three major eruptive periods before its last activity took place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago. It is not currently monitored for activity or [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]. Diverse species of flora and fauna inhabit the area, which is subject to frequent snowfall and temperature variation between seasons. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] skirts the eastern and northern sides and also accesses the only trail to the summit, the {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} McLoughlin Trail 3716.

Much of what is known today comes from LeRoy Maynard of the Center for Volcanology at the University of Oregon. His work established that the volcano was built over three eruptive phases, each with their own eruption types.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=128}} James Smith from the [[United States Geological Survey]] expanded on Maynard's findings, producing a map of the McLoughlin region.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=128}}\n\nMcLoughlin is part of the High Cascades,{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=127}} which trend north\u2013south.{{sfn|Joslin|2005|p=30}} Formed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north\u2013south [[fault (geology)|faulting]] in the surrounding region.{{sfn|Joslin|2005|p=31}} Like other Cascade volcanoes, Mount McLoughlin was fed by magma chambers produced by the [[subduction]] of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca tectonic plate]] under the western edge of the [[North American Plate|North American tectonic plate]].{{sfn|Wells|McCaffrey|2013|p=1027}} Within Oregon, [[pluton]]s, or bodies of [[intrusive rock|intrusive]] [[igneous rock]] that crystallize from magma cooling below the surface of the Earth, lay between {{convert|75|to|110|km|order=flip}} northwest of the major High Cascade axis. At McLoughlin, mean displacement rates for the past 16 million years have been {{convert|3.5|to|7.1|mm|in|order=flip}} each year.{{sfn|Wells|McCaffrey|2013|p=1028}}\n\nThe volcano shows magnetic high points to the east of its main cone, suggesting that it has normal magnetic polarization that corresponds to an age of less than 700,000 years.<ref name=\"USGS\"/> Other evidence that the volcano is geologically young include its symmetrical shape on the western and southern sides, its well-preserved lava flow deposits, and the absence of soil formation on many of its flow deposits.<ref name=\"USGS\"/>\n\nMcLoughlin is a [[stratovolcano]],<ref name=\"USGS\"/> made up of [[basaltic andesite]] on top of underlying basaltic andesitic [[shield volcano]]es.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}} Much of its central volcanic cone formed within the last 200,000 years, including lava flows on the sides of the mountain that are between 30,000 and 20,000 years old.<ref name=oregonstate/> The volcano has a volume of {{convert|3|cumi|km3|0}},<ref name=oregonstate/> and its lava is predominantly basaltic andesite with [[silicon dioxide]] content between 53 and 57&nbsp;percent, though it also has [[andesite]].{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}}\n\nDuring the last ice age, a large [[ice cap]] buried most of the High Cascades, reaching thicknesses in the thousands of feet. [[Pleistocene]] glaciers carved out McLoughlin's major volcanic cone, excavating two solidified [[lava tube]]s that reached the summit crater. From 25,000 to 12,000 years ago, glaciers on the northern slopes of the volcano combined with an ice cap at the base of the volcano that was about {{convert|500|ft|m}} thick. A [[cirque (landform)|cirque]] glacier occupied part of the depression until early in the 20th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=128}} The volcano displays a lack of snow during the summer season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2008/06/mount_mcloughlin.html|title=Mount McLoughlin: the peak of southern Oregon|last=Richard|first=T.|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Nearby features ===\n[[File:Agency_Lake.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pelican Butte]] with McLoughlin in the far left]]\n\nTwo nearby volcanoes closely resemble Mount McLoughlin in composition and structure. [[Brown Mountain (Klamath County, Oregon)|Brown Mountain]], a shield volcano with a volume of {{convert|1|cumi|km3}}, lies to the southeast, while [[Pelican Butte]], the most prominent shield volcano in the southern Cascades of Oregon, lies to the east.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}}\n\nBrown Mountain has been dated to between 60,000 and 12,000 years old. It produced basaltic andesite lava flows that have not been heavily eroded, but during Pleistocene glacial advance, ice streams on the volcano ate away at the cinder cone that formed Brown Mountain's summit. This formed a glacial cirque with a bowl shape on the northeastern flank.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}}\n\nPelican Butte reaches an elevation of {{convert|8036|ft|m}}, and it features gradual slopes. Adjacent to Klamath Lake, it has a greater volume than McLoughlin at {{convert|5|cumi|km3}}, and it is made up of basaltic andesite. Like Brown Mountain, Pelican Butte has a cinder cone on the top of its summit, in addition to a glacial cirque and ravine that were excavated on its northeastern side.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}} These eroded areas exhibit [[pyroclastic rock]] in a matrix with lava flows, suggesting that blocky and \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 lavas formed an outer shell around Pelican Butte's fragmented interior.{{sfn|Harris|2005|pp=131\u2013132}} Glaciation has also lowered the overall volcano by tens of yards.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=132}}\n\nOther volcanoes can be found within the Sky Lakes Wilderness area, including lava flows and mud flows at Big Bunchgrass Butte and Imagination Peak, in addition to more recent eruptive activity at Goosenest Mountain in the northeastern sector.{{sfn|Wuerthner|2003|p=166}}\n\n== Eruptive history ==\n[[File:UpperKlamathLake.jpg|thumb|right|Mount McLoughlin from the Upper Klamath Lake, showing its summit cone]]\n\nMount McLoughlin underwent at least three distinct eruptive phases.<ref name=\"USGS\"/> Early activity at Mount McLoughlin was [[explosive eruption|explosive]], and it yielded [[tephra]] and pyroclastic rock that built about a third of the overall volume.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}} These eruptions also yielded lava flows, but they only occurred on the lower flanks. The northwestern flank has volcanic vents that produced lava flows responsible for inundating the Fourbit Creek valley {{convert|4|mi|km}} from the base of McLoughlin, which extend up to the [[Big Butte Springs]]. Other lava flows from earlier eruptions reach at least {{convert|6|mi|km}} from the base of the mountain, a number of which run along the [[Oregon Route 140]] highway. One [[Lava#\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101|\u02bba\u02bb\u0101]] stream that filled a river valley for {{convert|6|mi|km}} in length moved from an elevation of {{convert|5000|ft|m}} to {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, though it was thin, with more than {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} of its length being less than {{convert|500|ft|m}} in width.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}}\n\nA second eruptive stage was characterized by large lava flows, which covered the inner pyroclastic core with basaltic andesite. These thin lava flows formed a shell around the loosely compacted pyroclastic interior.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=130}} The third stage of development consisted of floods of [[Lava#Block lava flows|blocky]] lava erupting from below the summit and more fluid lavas erupting from basal fissures, mostly confined to the south slope. North Squaw Tip<ref name=nst/> and South Squaw Tip<ref name=sst/> on McLoughlin's west flank now mark the site of the two major blocky flow vents. There are two smaller vents as well. The entire third stage is thought to have happened after the last Pleistocene glaciers in the area had melted, due to a general lack of [[weathering]] and fresh appearance of the solidified lava. The freshest lava flows at Mount McLoughlin occur on the southern and western flanks of the mountain, and they are thought to be between 30,000 and 20,000 years old.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}}\n\n=== Future activity ===\n\nMount McLoughlin's main volcanic cone has not erupted during the Holocene,{{sfn|Norris|1991|p=66}} with the last production of lava flows taking place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago.<ref name=gvp>{{cite gvp |vn=322834|name=McLoughlin |accessdate=January 28, 2018}}</ref> The volcano is not currently monitored for activity{{sfn|Norris|1991|p=1}} or [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]].{{sfn|Norris|1991|p=66}} The closest seismic monitoring stations lie {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} to the south near Mount Shasta and the [[Medicine Lake Volcano]].{{sfn|Norris|1991|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n== Human history ==\n[[File:John_McLoughlin_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_20110.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Mount McLoughlin got its official name from [[John McLoughlin]] (pictured), a factor for the Hudson's Bay Company]]\n\nMcLouglin has served as a landmark to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations for thousands of years.

It is one of the volcanic peaks in the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], within the High Cascades sector. A prominent landmark for the Rogue River Valley, the mountain is north of [[Mount Shasta]], and [[Crater Lake]] lies to the north-northeast. It was named around 1838 after [[John McLoughlin]], a [[Chief Factor]] for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. McLouglin's prominence has made it a landmark to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations for thousands of years.\n\nMcLoughlin consists largely of [[basaltic andesite]]. It underwent three major eruptive periods before its last activity took place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago. It is not currently monitored for activity or [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]. Diverse species of flora and fauna inhabit the area, which is subject to frequent snowfall and temperature variation between seasons. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] skirts the eastern and northern sides and also accesses the only trail to the summit, the {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} McLoughlin Trail 3716.

Much of what is known today comes from LeRoy Maynard of the Center for Volcanology at the University of Oregon. His work established that the volcano was built over three eruptive phases, each with their own eruption types.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=128}} James Smith from the [[United States Geological Survey]] expanded on Maynard's findings, producing a map of the McLoughlin region.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=128}}\n\nMcLoughlin is part of the High Cascades,{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=127}} which trend north\u2013south.{{sfn|Joslin|2005|p=30}} Formed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north\u2013south [[fault (geology)|faulting]] in the surrounding region.{{sfn|Joslin|2005|p=31}} Like other Cascade volcanoes, Mount McLoughlin was fed by magma chambers produced by the [[subduction]] of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca tectonic plate]] under the western edge of the [[North American Plate|North American tectonic plate]].{{sfn|Wells|McCaffrey|2013|p=1027}} Within Oregon, [[pluton]]s, or bodies of [[intrusive rock|intrusive]] [[igneous rock]] that crystallize from magma cooling below the surface of the Earth, lay between {{convert|75|to|110|km|order=flip}} northwest of the major High Cascade axis. At McLoughlin, mean displacement rates for the past 16 million years have been {{convert|3.5|to|7.1|mm|in|order=flip}} each year.{{sfn|Wells|McCaffrey|2013|p=1028}}\n\nThe volcano shows magnetic high points to the east of its main cone, suggesting that it has normal magnetic polarization that corresponds to an age of less than 700,000 years.<ref name=\"USGS\"/> Other evidence that the volcano is geologically young include its symmetrical shape on the western and southern sides, its well-preserved lava flow deposits, and the absence of soil formation on many of its flow deposits.<ref name=\"USGS\"/>\n\nMcLoughlin is a [[stratovolcano]],<ref name=\"USGS\"/> made up of [[basaltic andesite]] on top of underlying basaltic andesitic [[shield volcano]]es.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}} Much of its central volcanic cone formed within the last 200,000 years, including lava flows on the sides of the mountain that are between 30,000 and 20,000 years old.<ref name=oregonstate/> The volcano has a volume of {{convert|3|cumi|km3|0}},<ref name=oregonstate/> and its lava is predominantly basaltic andesite with [[silicon dioxide]] content between 53 and 57&nbsp;percent, though it also has [[andesite]].{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}}\n\nDuring the last ice age, a large [[ice cap]] buried most of the High Cascades, reaching thicknesses in the thousands of feet. [[Pleistocene]] glaciers carved out McLoughlin's major volcanic cone, excavating two solidified [[lava tube]]s that reached the summit crater. From 25,000 to 12,000 years ago, glaciers on the northern slopes of the volcano combined with an ice cap at the base of the volcano that was about {{convert|500|ft|m}} thick. A [[cirque (landform)|cirque]] glacier occupied part of the depression until early in the 20th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=128}} The volcano displays a lack of snow during the summer season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2008/06/mount_mcloughlin.html|title=Mount McLoughlin: the peak of southern Oregon|last=Richard|first=T.|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Nearby features ===\n[[File:Agency_Lake.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pelican Butte]] with McLoughlin in the far left]]\n\nTwo nearby volcanoes closely resemble Mount McLoughlin in composition and structure. [[Brown Mountain (Klamath County, Oregon)|Brown Mountain]], a shield volcano with a volume of {{convert|1|cumi|km3}}, lies to the southeast, while [[Pelican Butte]], the most prominent shield volcano in the southern Cascades of Oregon, lies to the east.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}}\n\nBrown Mountain has been dated to between 60,000 and 12,000 years old. It produced basaltic andesite lava flows that have not been heavily eroded, but during Pleistocene glacial advance, ice streams on the volcano ate away at the cinder cone that formed Brown Mountain's summit. This formed a glacial cirque with a bowl shape on the northeastern flank.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}}\n\nPelican Butte reaches an elevation of {{convert|8036|ft|m}}, and it features gradual slopes. Adjacent to Klamath Lake, it has a greater volume than McLoughlin at {{convert|5|cumi|km3}}, and it is made up of basaltic andesite. Like Brown Mountain, Pelican Butte has a cinder cone on the top of its summit, in addition to a glacial cirque and ravine that were excavated on its northeastern side.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}} These eroded areas exhibit [[pyroclastic rock]] in a matrix with lava flows, suggesting that blocky and \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 lavas formed an outer shell around Pelican Butte's fragmented interior.{{sfn|Harris|2005|pp=131\u2013132}} Glaciation has also lowered the overall volcano by tens of yards.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=132}}\n\nOther volcanoes can be found within the Sky Lakes Wilderness area, including lava flows and mud flows at Big Bunchgrass Butte and Imagination Peak, in addition to more recent eruptive activity at Goosenest Mountain in the northeastern sector.{{sfn|Wuerthner|2003|p=166}}\n\n== Eruptive history ==\n[[File:UpperKlamathLake.jpg|thumb|right|Mount McLoughlin from the Upper Klamath Lake, showing its summit cone]]\n\nMount McLoughlin underwent at least three distinct eruptive phases.<ref name=\"USGS\"/> Early activity at Mount McLoughlin was [[explosive eruption|explosive]], and it yielded [[tephra]] and pyroclastic rock that built about a third of the overall volume.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}} These eruptions also yielded lava flows, but they only occurred on the lower flanks. The northwestern flank has volcanic vents that produced lava flows responsible for inundating the Fourbit Creek valley {{convert|4|mi|km}} from the base of McLoughlin, which extend up to the [[Big Butte Springs]]. Other lava flows from earlier eruptions reach at least {{convert|6|mi|km}} from the base of the mountain, a number of which run along the [[Oregon Route 140]] highway. One [[Lava#\u02bbA\u02bb\u0101|\u02bba\u02bb\u0101]] stream that filled a river valley for {{convert|6|mi|km}} in length moved from an elevation of {{convert|5000|ft|m}} to {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, though it was thin, with more than {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} of its length being less than {{convert|500|ft|m}} in width.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=129}}\n\nA second eruptive stage was characterized by large lava flows, which covered the inner pyroclastic core with basaltic andesite. These thin lava flows formed a shell around the loosely compacted pyroclastic interior.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=130}} The third stage of development consisted of floods of [[Lava#Block lava flows|blocky]] lava erupting from below the summit and more fluid lavas erupting from basal fissures, mostly confined to the south slope. North Squaw Tip<ref name=nst/> and South Squaw Tip<ref name=sst/> on McLoughlin's west flank now mark the site of the two major blocky flow vents. There are two smaller vents as well. The entire third stage is thought to have happened after the last Pleistocene glaciers in the area had melted, due to a general lack of [[weathering]] and fresh appearance of the solidified lava. The freshest lava flows at Mount McLoughlin occur on the southern and western flanks of the mountain, and they are thought to be between 30,000 and 20,000 years old.{{sfn|Harris|2005|p=131}}\n\n=== Future activity ===\n\nMount McLoughlin's main volcanic cone has not erupted during the Holocene,{{sfn|Norris|1991|p=66}} with the last production of lava flows taking place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago.<ref name=gvp>{{cite gvp |vn=322834|name=McLoughlin |accessdate=January 28, 2018}}</ref> The volcano is not currently monitored for activity{{sfn|Norris|1991|p=1}} or [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]].{{sfn|Norris|1991|p=66}} The closest seismic monitoring stations lie {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} to the south near Mount Shasta and the [[Medicine Lake Volcano]].{{sfn|Norris|1991|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n== Human history ==\n[[File:John_McLoughlin_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_20110.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Mount McLoughlin got its official name from [[John McLoughlin]] (pictured), a factor for the Hudson's Bay Company]]\n\nMcLouglin has served as a landmark to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations for thousands of years.

After [[Mariazell]], Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of [[Austria]].\n\n==Geography==\nMaria Taferl is located in the [[Nibelungengau]] in Lower Austria on a bank over the [[Danube]].  47.48 percent of the municipality is forested.  As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called \"Taferlberg\" (''Taferl Mountain''), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area.  To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Opferstein Maria Taferl.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Opferstein'' (Sacrifice Rock)]]\nLittle is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl.  The [[Celt]]ic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube.  During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the [[Roman provinces|Province]] of [[Noricum]].  Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity.\n\nMaria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the [[Ostarrichi]] during the time of the [[Bamberg]]s in the [[Middle Ages]].  It then became part of the [[Habsburg]] holdings.  For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Wei\u00dfenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of [[M\u00fcnichreith-Laimbach|M\u00fcnichreith]]. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century.\n\nThe first church was built around a shrine to the [[Virgin Mary|Holy Mother]], which is the origin of the name \"Maria Taferl.\"  The legends say that the statue of the [[Piet\u00e0]] at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness.  It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding.  The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue.\n\nThe church building was built from 1660 to 1710.  Its construction was begun under the imperial architect [[Georg Gerstenbrand]] and the Italian [[Carlo Lurago]].  Its famous [[cupola]] was built by [[Jakob Prandtauer]] from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of [[Melk Abbey]]. The Maria Taferl church is built in the [[baroque architecture|baroque]] style with ample amounts of [[gold leaf]] and a [[fresco]]ed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature.  The building's rear houses its [[crypt]].\n\nAccording to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]], the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish Wars]], and the [[Thirty Years' War]] had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube.\n\nThere are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century.  The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]es said there.  The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number.  Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured.  Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of [[Freistadt]] for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] and his family lived in the nearby [[Artstetten-P\u00f6bring|Artstetten]] Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl.\n\nMaria Taferl became a ''[[basilica|Basilica minor]]'' in 1947.\n\nBy 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration.  It will then celebrate a double jubilee:  350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered.\n\nBesides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups.\n\nThere is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints.\n\nOther landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins.\n\n<gallery>\n Maria Taferl - Kirche (3).JPG|Basilica of Maria Taferl\n Hochaltar in maria taferl.jpg|The High Altar, Maria Taferl Basilica\n Maria Taferl - Hochaltar 4 Jesaia.jpg|Statue of Isaiah on the high altar\n Schinnagel.jpg|Pachmann and Schinagel depicted in the basilica\n</gallery>\n\n==Municipal divisions==\nThe municipality of Maria Taferl is divided into seven districts:\n* Maria Taferl Market\n* Obererla\n* Untererla\n* Reitern\n* Oberthalheim\n* Unterthalheim\n* Wimm\n\n==Politics==\nThe mayor of Maria Taferl is Herbert Gruber and the Chief Officer is Daniela Lahmer.

Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms.

Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico.

The song is entitled \"Bro, Ikaw ang Star ng Pasko\" ({{literal translation|Bro, You are the Star of Christmas}}). [[Parol|Christmas lanterns]] were specially created by ABS-CBN that are sold to benefit ABS-CBN foundation's charity programs. ABS-CBN launched ''Parol ni Bro'' November 4, 2009, where an 18-foot Christmas lantern on the top of ABS-CBN building was lit up by the May Bukas Pa cast, ABS-CBN president [[Charo Santos-Concio]], and ABS-CBN chairman and CEO [[Eugenio Lopez III]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Feature/Article/5474/ABS-CBN-lights-up-the-Parol-ni-Bro-.aspx|title=Showbuzz|publisher=ABS-CBN.com|date=|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was later used for the network's 2010 and 2019 Christmas Station IDs \"Ngayong Pasko Magniningning Ang Pilipino\" ({{literal translation|This Christmas, the Filipinos will Shine}}) and \"Family is Forever\". [[GMA Network|GMA]] also had its 2019 Christmas Station ID \"Love Shines\" having scenes patterned after the 2009 ID.\n\n==Reception==\nDue to the show's ratings, [[ABS-CBN]]'s management has decided to extend it for 20 weeks instead of the initial eight weeks.<ref>[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/%E2%80%98may-bukas-pa%E2%80%99-remains-top \"May Bukas Pa\u201d extended due to high ratings\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322013242/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/%E2%80%98may-bukas-pa%E2%80%99-remains-top|date=22 March 2009}} by Noypitayo.com 15 February 2009.</ref> On June 23, 2009, ABS-CBN television head Cory Vidanes announced that the show would be extended until February 2010.<ref name=\"zai\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/06/23/09/abs-cbn-extends-airing-may-bukas-pa |title=ABS-CBN extends airing of 'May Bukas Pa'|work=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=23 June 2009|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n''May Bukas Pa'' became the first primetime TV series in the Philippines to have lasted at least a full year and end in the 2010s decade, peaking during its finale with 47.3% nationwide rating according to Kantar Media/TNS. It currently stands as the country's highest-rated show of all time since Philippine television [[Kantar Media|switched to nationwide TV ratings system]] in the opening day of 2009.\n\n===Critical reception===\nEntertainment columnist Nestor Torre of the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] said \"It must have been a big decision for the new show\u2019s producers to get away from that downbeat view of life and come up with this ''Marcelino Pan Y Vino''-inspired tale. But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

In the \"afterlife\" scenes in the finale, sunlight obscures His face when cameras are focused on Him and before the end of the afterlife scenes, He is seen in silhouette.\n*Uncredited voice actor as [[Satan]] - Unlike Bro who physically appears, Satan is only depicted as a reddish white light and speaks with a sinister, bone-chilling voice.

Upon learning about this said information, Franco instantly claims custody of the said kid; and in order to successfully do so, he tries seeking Mayor Enrique's help. Without hesitation, Enrique gives his full support to Franco's case. He instantly suggests a DNA test; and once the DNA test results prove that Franco is in fact Santino's biological father, the DSWD will then be awarding Santino's custody to him. After Enrique finds out that Franco is not the real father, Enrique decided to have a DNA test. It is then proven that Enrique is Santino's real father, and the DNA sample Franco gave was actually Enrique's. Enrique then decided to back out of the mayoral race in order to spend more time with his children, and gets ready to face corruption charges that may be filed against him after leaving office. Meanwhile, a fugitive Robert greets Enrique during his birthday, with Rico and Santino abducted by Robert. Mario and Enrique then pursue a chase against Robert, which leads to the death of Enrique and injuries to Rico during the rescue process.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Weekdays/episode/detail/article/6215/maybukaspa/Episode244.aspx |title=ABS-CBN.com |publisher=ABS-CBN.com|date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n*[[Jay Manalo]] as Franco de Jesus - a man who claims that he is Santino's real father.

It was later revealed that her friend was Teresa Malimban, a woman connected to the lives of people of Bagong Pag-asa. She found out that her friend had died more than 5 years ago and later decided to search for Teresa's son Gabriel (who is Santino).\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Six: Temptation===\nAfter Enrique's death, Tilde was arrested for being involved in the death of Malena. However, she was able to escape under the pretense of labor; while being driven, she got the gun of Dante, the policeman driving the vehicle. Rico was resentful of Santino because of their father's death. Santino then felt sad as he believes he's bad luck due to the death of Enrique and the anger of Rico; Father Jose told him that he was not the Santino who was trying to be happy despite the hardships and trials. Meanwhile, Santino was being told by a voice (possibly Satan's) that he should come to it and he was cursed by Bro. He ends up being helped by angels on his way and ends up at a home for the homeless, run by Lola Milgaros, a blind grandmother. Meanwhile, a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Mr. Chan is trying to put into action his plan to take the house and the land where it stands for his business expansion. He constantly tries to take the place but also fails. Santino meets Mr. Chan and discovers his ailing daughter whom he heals. Mr. Chan continues to do his pursuit despite his daughter's recovery and also still doesn't believe in God. On one night, Lola Milagros' home is set on fire by arsonists and miracles happen when rain falls and stops the fire. Learning of the incident, Mr. Chan has a change of heart and quits his pursuit by giving Milagros a check of a huge sum of money for repairs and necessities.\n\n*[[Gloria Sevilla]] as Lola Milagros - A blind old woman who is the owner of a home open to homeless people.\n*Jeff Henson Dee as Mr. Chan - a wealthy [[Chinese Filipino]] businessman who is constantly trying to take the house for the homeless as well as the land where it stands. He later helps Milagros after arsonists set fire to her house.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Seven: Believe===\nA Manila-based journalist named Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor arrives at Bagong Pag-asa to search for news featuring the miracles in the small town. And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pgag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair. At the monastery, the monks and Mario collaborate with each other to find Santino.\n\n*[[Ryan Agoncillo]] as Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor - A journalist and CBN News Reporter who visits Bagong Pag-asa after hearing about the news of Rico's encounter with \"Bro\". He was a former missionary who abandoned his vocation and lost his faith in Christ.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Eight: Amen===\nPaolo turns Santino over to Mario and the police chief before going on an errand. As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

The community is mainly known as an important [[pilgrimage]] destination among rural [[Innviertel]]. The name comes from its location on the \u201cSchmollner Berg\u201d, literally small mountain.\n\n==Geography==\nMaria Schmolln lies in the south of the [[Innviertel]] amid the rolling hills (max height: 767 m - 2,516&nbsp;ft) covered by the Kobernau\u00dfer Forest, which, together with the adiacent Hausruck Forest in [[Hausruckviertel]],  is one of the largest contiguous forest in Central Europe.\nThe municipality is structured in the three cadastral entities of Oberminathal, Schnellenberg and Schweigert Reith, and has an extension of 34,47&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (13,31 sq mi).<br>\nGeologically the area is part of the [[molasse basin]] that formed, north of the Alps, during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Duchy of Bavaria]] owned the area until 1780 when the [[Peace of Teschen]] awarded the entire [[Innviertel]], then called \"Innbaiern\", to [[Austria]].\nFor a short period of time, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it returned to Bavaria, but in 1814 it was definitively incorporated into Upper Austria. Maria Schmolln didn't exist yet.\nThe community established itself only in the years from 1860 to 1863 by settling around the shrine and growing with it until, by the end of 1898, Maria Schmolln became an independent municipality.\nAfter the \u201c[[Anschluss]]\u201d, the annexation of Austria to the [[German Reich]] on 13 March 1938, the village belonged to the [[Reichsgau Oberdonau|\"Upper Danube\"]] entity. However in 1945 at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], it returned to the Upper Austria state of an independent Austria.\nIn 2006 a [[Stolperstein]] was laid down in the sidewalk in front of the door of the last address of the Franciscan Father Ludwig Seraphim Binder, killed by the Nazi regime.\nForty more [[Stolpersteine in the district of Braunau am Inn|Stolpersteine]] were placed in the district of Braunau am Inn by [[Cologne]] artist [[Gunter Demnig]] in memory of victims of the [[Third Reich]].\n\n==The Sanctuary==\n[[Image:Maria Schmolln.jpg|thumb|upright|The front of the sanctuary; on the left St. Mary chapel.]]\nAccording to tradition, all started in 1735 when the farmer Michael Priewasser hung a picture of Saint Mary on a tree in memory of his lost son. This way passers-by would stop and be moved to pray for him. Already in 1784, due to the growing popularity of the place, a wooden chapel was built, and afterward demolished, in 1810, by the order of the authorities. As the image of Saint Virgin Mary kept being worshiped by many, in 1850 a new wooden chapel was built, as well as a shelter for the pilgrims, clearings were made so that people could start settling around the shrine, and so a village was born and continued to grow.\n\nOn their own initiative the inhabitants then built the present-day shrine, which, together with a small Franciscan Cloister and the elementary school, was opened in 1863. In 1880 the original wooden chapel was demolished and a chapel, that can be seen today, was built at the northern side of the sanctuary.\nIn 1867 Maria Schmolln became a separate parish as it came to be the most important pilgrimage site in the [[Innviertel]].\n\nThe shrine, built in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque revival style]], is 42 meters long and 15 meters wide.\nThe side chapel, where the image of St. Mary is worshiped, was built according to the plans of the artist and Franciscan abbot John Mary Reiter.

The new main and side altars were designed and built by the Tyrolean sculptor Rudolf Millonig, as was the new \u201cpilgrims fountain\u201d, built near the side chapel in 2007.\n\n===The cloister===\nIn 1864 the Bishop [[Franz-Josef Rudigier]] concerned himself with providing the pilgrims with a due pastoral care, and upon his invitation the first Franciscans from [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]moved in. \nAs the pilgrimage site blossomed, in 1871 the original rectory was enlarged to become a cloister hosting ten Franciscans, who not only took care of pilgrims but attended also to the surrounding communities.\nIn 1941 the monastery was closed on Nazi's orders. Only two priests remained, and one part of the building was transformed into a children shelter.\nIn 1945 the cloister was given back its original function, and today a small Franciscan convent continues to serve the chapel.\n\n[[Image:Maria schmolln ortsplatz.jpg|650 px]]\n\n==Community==\nIn the local council three parties are represented (2009): [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] (11 seats), [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]] (6 seats), [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] (2 seats).\n\nThe nursing home \" Maria Rast \" has been around since 1884 and is operated  by the Franciscans nouns of [[V\u00f6cklabruck]]. In 2002 the home was extended with a new building on three floors and 80 beds. The old building was renovated and now hosts several sheltered accommodations for vulnerable people.\n\nOver twenty clubs are active in Maria Schmolln, the most important being the beekeeper club, the Music Band, the Theater Group, the Church Choir. The local Union houses and organizes many sport and wellness activities like judo, cross country, downhill skiing / snowboarding, curling, and tennis. There is also a municipal swimming pool and ski lift.<br>\nMountain biking is also a popular activity carried out in the lush wooded area surrounding the village by locals as well as tourists.<br>\nThere are also more traditional activities: [[L\u00e4ndler]] dance, erection of [[Maypole]], folk, carnival and garden festivals.<br>\nThe [[Volunteer fire department]] manage many different social recreations, like the Forest Festival which falls in the summer months.

The community is mainly known as an important [[pilgrimage]] destination among rural [[Innviertel]]. The name comes from its location on the \u201cSchmollner Berg\u201d, literally small mountain.\n\n==Geography==\nMaria Schmolln lies in the south of the [[Innviertel]] amid the rolling hills (max height: 767 m - 2,516&nbsp;ft) covered by the Kobernau\u00dfer Forest, which, together with the adiacent Hausruck Forest in [[Hausruckviertel]],  is one of the largest contiguous forest in Central Europe.\nThe municipality is structured in the three cadastral entities of Oberminathal, Schnellenberg and Schweigert Reith, and has an extension of 34,47&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (13,31 sq mi).<br>\nGeologically the area is part of the [[molasse basin]] that formed, north of the Alps, during the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] epochs.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Duchy of Bavaria]] owned the area until 1780 when the [[Peace of Teschen]] awarded the entire [[Innviertel]], then called \"Innbaiern\", to [[Austria]].\nFor a short period of time, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it returned to Bavaria, but in 1814 it was definitively incorporated into Upper Austria. Maria Schmolln didn't exist yet.\nThe community established itself only in the years from 1860 to 1863 by settling around the shrine and growing with it until, by the end of 1898, Maria Schmolln became an independent municipality.\nAfter the \u201c[[Anschluss]]\u201d, the annexation of Austria to the [[German Reich]] on 13 March 1938, the village belonged to the [[Reichsgau Oberdonau|\"Upper Danube\"]] entity. However in 1945 at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], it returned to the Upper Austria state of an independent Austria.\nIn 2006 a [[Stolperstein]] was laid down in the sidewalk in front of the door of the last address of the Franciscan Father Ludwig Seraphim Binder, killed by the Nazi regime.\nForty more [[Stolpersteine in the district of Braunau am Inn|Stolpersteine]] were placed in the district of Braunau am Inn by [[Cologne]] artist [[Gunter Demnig]] in memory of victims of the [[Third Reich]].\n\n==The Sanctuary==\n[[Image:Maria Schmolln.jpg|thumb|upright|The front of the sanctuary; on the left St. Mary chapel.]]\nAccording to tradition, all started in 1735 when the farmer Michael Priewasser hung a picture of Saint Mary on a tree in memory of his lost son. This way passers-by would stop and be moved to pray for him. Already in 1784, due to the growing popularity of the place, a wooden chapel was built, and afterward demolished, in 1810, by the order of the authorities. As the image of Saint Virgin Mary kept being worshiped by many, in 1850 a new wooden chapel was built, as well as a shelter for the pilgrims, clearings were made so that people could start settling around the shrine, and so a village was born and continued to grow.\n\nOn their own initiative the inhabitants then built the present-day shrine, which, together with a small Franciscan Cloister and the elementary school, was opened in 1863. In 1880 the original wooden chapel was demolished and a chapel, that can be seen today, was built at the northern side of the sanctuary.\nIn 1867 Maria Schmolln became a separate parish as it came to be the most important pilgrimage site in the [[Innviertel]].\n\nThe shrine, built in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque revival style]], is 42 meters long and 15 meters wide.\nThe side chapel, where the image of St. Mary is worshiped, was built according to the plans of the artist and Franciscan abbot John Mary Reiter. A glass panel on the floor marks the location of the tree on which the image was originally fixed.\nIn 1962 the rich [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] features of the interior with their polychrome decorations and paintings were removed and replaced with a white finish.\nAgain, in 1992 an extensive renovation and redesign of the interior took place. The new main and side altars were designed and built by the Tyrolean sculptor Rudolf Millonig, as was the new \u201cpilgrims fountain\u201d, built near the side chapel in 2007.\n\n===The cloister===\nIn 1864 the Bishop [[Franz-Josef Rudigier]] concerned himself with providing the pilgrims with a due pastoral care, and upon his invitation the first Franciscans from [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]moved in. \nAs the pilgrimage site blossomed, in 1871 the original rectory was enlarged to become a cloister hosting ten Franciscans, who not only took care of pilgrims but attended also to the surrounding communities.\nIn 1941 the monastery was closed on Nazi's orders. Only two priests remained, and one part of the building was transformed into a children shelter.\nIn 1945 the cloister was given back its original function, and today a small Franciscan convent continues to serve the chapel.\n\n[[Image:Maria schmolln ortsplatz.jpg|650 px]]\n\n==Community==\nIn the local council three parties are represented (2009): [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]] (11 seats), [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]] (6 seats), [[Freedom Party of Austria|FP\u00d6]] (2 seats).\n\nThe nursing home \" Maria Rast \" has been around since 1884 and is operated  by the Franciscans nouns of [[V\u00f6cklabruck]].

He included that footage in his film \u2018You, Me and the SPP\u2019, which he released in 2009. Manly has made two films about water issues on Vancouver Island, \u2018Voices of the River\u2019 about the Nanaimo River, and \u2018Troubled Water\u2019 about the community drinking-water watershed on the east coast of the island.\n\nManly has worked on a number of educational projects related to aboriginal culture, mental health, health care, environmental stewardship and economic alternatives.
