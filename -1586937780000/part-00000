The area was much larger than the park today, extending from Victoria Gardens to the north, over the present site and into what is now [[Park Crescent, Brighton|Park Crescent]].<ref name=\"Bance\"/> -->\n\nLondon Road and Lewes Road, two major routes leading out of Brighton, were built along steep-sided valleys through which [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbournes]] flowed intermittently. The valleys, and therefore the streams, met where The Level is now and flowed out to sea at [[Old Steine|the Steine]].<ref name=\"Antram4\">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=4.}}</ref> The land was always marshy and swampy and was never built upon.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> Instead, it became a popular place for public recreation and entertainment as Brighton grew into a fashionable resort town in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Fines25\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=25.}}</ref> After the town's authorities banned ball games and other traditional entertainments on [[Old Steine|the Steine]] in 1787, The Level became the focus for the early resort's sporting activities:<ref name=\"Seldon62\">{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=62.}}</ref> four years later the Prince of Wales (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom]]) laid out a [[Ground (cricket)|cricket ground]] on the northern side. The [[Prince of Wales Ground]] hosted early [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches and served as the home of [[Brighton Cricket Club]], one of the principal founders of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] 50 years later. In 1822 the cricket ground moved to a nearby site called the Hanover Ground; after another move to the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] on the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]], it was established on its present site on Eaton Road in Hove in 1872.<ref name=\"Seldon62\"/> The Bat and Ball pub on Ditchling Road, facing the west side of The Level, commemorates the ground.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> Other popular events included the town's annual bonfire celebrations on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], regular circuses and fairs, and traditional activities such as [[bat and trap]]<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> and skipping. Writing in 1883, a contributor to the ''[[Sussex Archaeological Society|Sussex Archaeological Collections]]'' journal noted that the local [[Good Friday]] tradition of skipping was still maintained at The Level, where \"scores of skippers\" could be seen.<ref name=\"Underwood24\">{{Harvnb|Underwood|1978|p=24.}}</ref>\n\nAs well as these informal recreational events, The Level (especially the southern part, closest to the town centre) was used for formal, town-wide events and commemorations, such as the Prince's birthday celebrations.<ref name=\"Fines25\"/> The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Allied Powers']] defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was celebrated in Brighton by the Great Peace Festival of August 1814. A mass dinner of roast beef and plum puddings was served at 75 double rows of tables for more than 7,000 people,<ref name=\"Fines26\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=26.}}</ref><ref name=\"Erredge299-300\">{{Harvnb|Erredge|1862|pp=299\u2013300.}}</ref> and the town's authorities organised activities such as running races, [[stoolball]], dancing and [[kiss-in-the-ring]].<ref name=\"Fines26\"/> The coronations of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] and [[Queen Victoria]] and the end of both the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Crimean War]] were celebrated with similar large-scale public feasts.<ref name=\"NEB177\"/>\n\nOn 22 April 1822, the 8 acres of land that nowadays form The Level was given in trust to Brighton by [[Thomas Read Kemp]] and other landowners.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/><ref name=\"Antram184\">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=184.}}</ref> Thereafter, apart from {{convert|105|acre|ha}} of [[downland]] near [[Brighton Racecourse]], far out of town on top of Race Hill, The Level was the only area of common land available to the town's residents.<ref name=\"OOB50\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=50.}}</ref> In the same year Union Road was built to connect the Ditchling and Lewes Roads, marking the northern edge of The Level, and the land to the north of it was sold.

The shortest and most direct, covering {{convert|47.5|mi|km}} but requiring the most expensive construction work, would have terminated just north of The Level on the site of James Ireland's pleasure gardens.<ref name=\"OOB133\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=133.}}</ref> After [[Brighton main line|a line]] was built slightly further west in 1841, Brighton's population grew rapidly and its character changed.<ref name=\"NEB268\">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=268.}}</ref> One feature of the mid- to late 19th century was a rapid growth in prostitution; it was common at The Level, when at night \"the scenes ... were said to beggar all description\".<ref name=\"OOB196\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=196.}}</ref> A police station was established in a small building at the southern end of the park in 1865.

Among the regular events held there was the annual May Day rally and demonstration by the Brighton Trades Council, which was formed in 1890. These events \"became well known nationally\"; members included [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was employed as a draper's assistant in Brighton at the time and who later became the first female [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Fines78\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=78.}}</ref> Later, local resident [[Harry Cowley]] was an organiser of the barrow boys\u2014many of whom had been in the armed forces during World War I\u2014on nearby Oxford Street. In the early 1920s he negotiated permission for them to sell fruit and vegetables alongside the rose garden on The Level.

In the past, the land has been used as a [[Ground (cricket)|cricket ground]] for the [[Prince of Wales]] and as a setting for huge dinner parties to commemorate events such as the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]].\n\nPresent day features of the Level include a grassed area with [[elm trees]] and outdoor seating, several caf\u00e9s, a [[skatepark]], a rose garden, a children's [[playground]] and a pond.

The northern part of the [[urban park]] is a grassed area. In the middle section is a [[skatepark]]. The southern part of the park is a children's [[playground]] and also includes two cafes, public lavatories, a pavilion which can be hired for community use, a pond with a fountain, a sensory garden and a zone for [[boccia]] and [[p\u00e9tanque]].<ref name=\"BHCC\" /><ref name=\"LUC\" />\n\n[[Brighton and Hove City Council]] added The Level to their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015.

The valleys, and therefore the streams, met where The Level is now and flowed out to sea at [[Old Steine|the Steine]].<ref name=\"Antram4\">{{Harvnb|Antram|Morrice|2008|p=4.}}</ref> The land was always marshy and swampy and was never built upon.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> Instead, it became a popular place for public recreation and entertainment as Brighton grew into a fashionable resort town in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Fines25\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=25.}}</ref> After the town's authorities banned ball games and other traditional entertainments on [[Old Steine|the Steine]] in 1787, The Level became the focus for the early resort's sporting activities:<ref name=\"Seldon62\">{{Harvnb|Seldon|2002|p=62.}}</ref> four years later the Prince of Wales (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom]]) laid out a [[Ground (cricket)|cricket ground]] on the northern side. The [[Prince of Wales Ground]] hosted early [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches and served as the home of [[Brighton Cricket Club]], one of the principal founders of [[Sussex County Cricket Club]] 50 years later. In 1822 the cricket ground moved to a nearby site called the Hanover Ground; after another move to the [[Royal Brunswick Ground]] on the [[Brunswick (Hove)|Brunswick estate]], it was established on its present site on Eaton Road in Hove in 1872.<ref name=\"Seldon62\"/> The Bat and Ball pub on Ditchling Road, facing the west side of The Level, commemorates the ground.<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> Other popular events included the town's annual bonfire celebrations on [[Guy Fawkes Night]], regular circuses and fairs, and traditional activities such as [[bat and trap]]<ref name=\"NEB176\"/> and skipping. Writing in 1883, a contributor to the ''[[Sussex Archaeological Society|Sussex Archaeological Collections]]'' journal noted that the local [[Good Friday]] tradition of skipping was still maintained at The Level, where \"scores of skippers\" could be seen.<ref name=\"Underwood24\">{{Harvnb|Underwood|1978|p=24.}}</ref>\n\nAs well as these informal recreational events, The Level (especially the southern part, closest to the town centre) was used for formal, town-wide events and commemorations, such as the Prince's birthday celebrations.<ref name=\"Fines25\"/> The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Allied Powers']] defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was celebrated in Brighton by the Great Peace Festival of August 1814.

The shortest and most direct, covering {{convert|47.5|mi|km}} but requiring the most expensive construction work, would have terminated just north of The Level on the site of James Ireland's pleasure gardens.<ref name=\"OOB133\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=133.}}</ref> After [[Brighton main line|a line]] was built slightly further west in 1841, Brighton's population grew rapidly and its character changed.<ref name=\"NEB268\">{{Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=268.}}</ref> One feature of the mid- to late 19th century was a rapid growth in prostitution; it was common at The Level, when at night \"the scenes ... were said to beggar all description\".<ref name=\"OOB196\">{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1975|p=196.}}</ref> A police station was established in a small building at the southern end of the park in 1865.

Among the regular events held there was the annual May Day rally and demonstration by the Brighton Trades Council, which was formed in 1890. These events \"became well known nationally\"; members included [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was employed as a draper's assistant in Brighton at the time and who later became the first female [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet minister in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Fines78\">{{Harvnb|Fines|2002|p=78.}}</ref> Later, local resident [[Harry Cowley]] was an organiser of the barrow boys\u2014many of whom had been in the armed forces during World War I\u2014on nearby Oxford Street.

In transforming the Zorki into an SLR, the simplest approach was taken: the rangefinder housing was removed from the top and replaced by a plain ground-glass screen and prism; a mirror was added below, with a rope-and-pulley setting system  and the [[M39 lens mount|M39]]\u00d71 thread mount was pushed forward to make room for the mirror inside.\n\nDuring the first years of production (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (almost like the Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the Pentaprism of all classical Zenits was undersize, with the viewfinder showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.\n\n===Zenit-E and its successors===\n[[File:Zenit-E Camera with Industar 50mm lens.jpg|thumb|Zenit E with Industar 50-2 50/3.5 Lens and Selenium-cell lightmeter]]\n[[File:Zenit e.jpg|thumb|Zenit E with Helios 44-2 lens, made in 1971]]\nDuring 1967 through 1969 KMZ built an automatic die-cast moulding line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production switched to the [[M42 lens mount|M42\u00d71]] thread (also known as [[Praktica]] thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led to one of the most famous Zenits \u2014 '''Zenit-E''' which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of \"what isn't there, can't go wrong\".  Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the shutter release button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter.  Production included both M39\u00d71 and M42\u00d71 mounts for the Zenit E and [[Zenit B]] models.  Later models were only produced in the M42\u00d71 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, the Zenit-E heritage became an obstacle to the development of more modern Zenit models. This was because almost all low-end Zenits until the recent 412DX have been based on the Zenit-E die-cast chassis, complying with the local philosophy that a crude but affordable camera was better than no camera.\n{{anchor|zenit_ttl}}<!-- Used for [[Zenit TTL]] redirect linking to subsection here -->\nThe major events of the further development of Zenit-E line was:\n*Introduction of an automatic 'jumping' [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] on the '''Zenit-EM'''\n*[[Through-the-lens|TTL]] metering system (instead of a non-coupled Selenium-cell lightmeter) on the '''Zenit-TTL'''\n*Switching to the [[Pentax K mount]] \u2014 '''Zenit-122K'''\n*DX-code introduction (instead of manual ISO-speed switch) \u2014 '''Zenit-412DX'''\n\nThe Zenit-E was also sold with the [[Moscow 1980 Olympics]] emblem.\n\n===Advanced models===\n[[File:Zenit 122 camera.jpg|thumb|Zenit 122]]\nThe first attempt to make high-end professional camera by KMZ was the '''Start''' in 1958. This camera had a full set of shutter speeds (from 1 sec to 1/1000), a lens with an automatic diaphragm in a unique [[breech-lock]] mount, and even a knife for cutting-off part of the unexposed film. The photographer could choose between a pentaprism and waist-level finders. The grave disadvantage of the Start is blamed on lack of lenses; only one lens (the [[Helios (lens brand)|Helios]]-44 f2/58) was ever made for the proprietary Start mount directly.\n\nWith the success of the Zeiss-Ikon Contaflex of the mid-1950s and its follow-ups in form of the Bessamatic, Retina- and Paxette-reflex, Zenit's next attempt was the '''Zenit-4''' (1964), '''-5''' and '''-6''' cameras. These were based on a [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] Bessamatic-type mount with Compur-type iris-shutter near the lens elements. The poor durability and high manufacturing cost of this concept in contrast to the classical barebone Zenit design based on ultimate simplicity showed KMZ to have taken a wrong track: Nevertheless, the Zenit-5 was the first Soviet motor-driven SLR camera, and the first Soviet zoom lens (Rubin-1c 2.8/37\u201380, based on [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] Zoomar design) featured in the '''Zenit-6'''.\n\nFollowing this, there were two more attempts to make high-end photographic equipment, namely the '''Zenit-7''' (1968) and '''Zenit-D''' (1969). Both were based on the completely new cloth-curtain shutter construction. The '''Zenit-D''' had automatic exposure mode. Its shutter was sped up to achieve X-sync at 1/125. Each of these had its own bayonet mount (\"mount 7\" and \"mount D\" respectively) which helped to utilize the camera's most advanced features. There were plans to develop a full line of optics for these cameras but the new shutter was too complicated and unreliable. Production was cancelled shortly after, and the only lens made for new mounts were the standard types. The '''Start''', '''Zenit-7''' and '''Zenit-D''' utilized the same normal lens \u2014 a Helios-44 2/58. The Zenit-D is one of the rarest Zenit cameras \u2014 only 63 cameras were produced.\n\nThe Zenit 12-XP With its Helios f2/58mm lens and cloth shutter was widely sold by US Eastern camera stores. Many with the Zenit name covered with their \"USA\" brand. This Metallic re-badge was easy enough to gently pry off to see the true name Zenit. The TTL meter was fairly accurate and took decent shots. The 1981 price was $110 usa. The Russians believed that 58mm more closely matched the Human normal range than the standard 50mm used worldwide as a normal lens. It also had a T setting for timed exposures making it a good choice for yearly fireworks displays. The \"T\" setting locked the shutter open allowing a tripod mounted camera to be used with an index card to manually open for few bursts of fire works and then close and reset.\n\nAfter one more unsuccessful camera ('''Zenit-16''') which was produced in very small quantities, in 1979 production of the '''Zenit-19''' began. This was a camera with an original electromagnet-driven focal-plane shutter, M42 lens mount, and shutter speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000.  X-sync at 1/60 or 1/125 (camera was modified during production). The camera has only manual shooting mode (with a TTL-meter and a needle indicator of the proper exposition in the viewfinder). The Zenit-19 was, perhaps, the top-of-the-line Soviet [[M42 lens mount]] camera.\n\n===Pentax-K mount series===\nIn 1984 the '''Zenit-automat''' entered production. This had a [[Pentax K mount]] (which was proposed as an [[open standard]] by [[Pentax]] and distributed freely{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}) and a focal shutter with horizontal-travel cloth curtains. The only operation mode was [[aperture-priority]]. The camera was modified in 1988, to include shutter FZL-84 with vertical-travel metal curtains, and was reissued as the '''Zenit-AM'''. The '''Zenit-AM2''' was a cheaper version of the AM without the self-timer.\n\nNext in line was the '''Zenit-APK'''. Its distinguishing feature was the introduction of a manual shutter mode in addition to aperture-priority. The original FZL-84 shutter was also changed to a licensed 'Copal Square' shutter.\n\nThe most recent model is the '''Zenit-KM''' of 2001. This is the second microprocessor-controlled camera in the Zenit range (the first one was the second variant of the '''Zenit-automat''' camera), and the second (after the Zenit-5) motor-driven SLR camera built by KMZ. Shutter speeds range from 1/2000 to 1 sec (and up to 16 sec in Auto mode). X-sync is 1/125 sec, and the camera includes both manual shutter and aperture-priority modes as well as DX-coding from 50 to 3200 [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. In 2004, the KM received some improvements and was renamed to the '''Zenit-KM Plus'''\n\nThe Zenit-KM Plus was the final Zenit camera to be produced; {{As of|2005|lc=on}} all SLR camera production at the Krasnogorsk factory ceased. These highly interesting ultimate Zeniths would have been major sellers on Western markets during the \"SLR-decade\" of the 1970s.{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} However, they appeared at a time when their market-segment was saturated with second-hand equipment, so no major importer looked at them{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}. One of the characteristics of Soviet camera manufacture was that the capability of its designers was well ahead of that of its policy-makers.  The 20-year overdue replacement of the external selenium cell of the Zenit E by TTL-metering is said to be the work of an employee who made a conversion on his own accord.    <!-- **** WHAT ABOUT THE BELARUS PLANT? **** **** It closed a cameras production in 1990! **** -->\n\n===Soviet Export Policy===\nIn the West, the success of the Zenit line can be focused on the United Kingdom, primarily due to the marketing activity and service of TOE, and secondly the originally heavy UK tax-load of up to two-thirds on imported precision cameras.\nSubstantial quantities were later sold by German discounters like Foto-Quelle and Neckermann. The main criticism of the USSR exporters at the time was that they could only supply hopelessly outdated equipment like the Zenit E that they had been directed to produce in quantity, despite having the capacity to produce more technically advanced products that might have been attractive to Western buyers. TOE were fighting a constant battle with their USSR-suppliers in this direction, having to fill the gap left by the excellent but not-for-export Soviet lenses which would have been a major selling-point, by a hodge-podge selection of second-rate mass-market optics from Japan, albeit under the \"Helios\" label.\n\n===Standard Zenit Lenses===\nThe original Zenit came with the sturdy click-stop four-element 3.5/50mm Zeiss Tessar copy under the \"Industar\" designation.  Early aluminium variants made in several different bodies were finely blue-coated, whereas the later mass-produced black version was either partially or un-coated with no visible colour on the glass. They were sharp but gave the typically \"foggy\" image of an uncoated lens with bright lighting.  With the iris ring sitting inside the focussing ring it was impossible to focus at full aperture followed by stopping down, as this moved the point of focus.  What makes these lenses interesting is their very compact \"pancake\" design. The concept of the makers was to offer a sharp Tessar-type lens of the simplest possible body construction, leaving out all progress made in this field since 1945.  The most prominent lens is the 6-element 2.0/58mm \"Helios\" based on the pre-war Zeiss Biotar (US Patent 1,786,916 (W.Mert\u00e9, 1930) Zenit also manufactures several [[Tair (lens)|Tair]] lenses in different focal lengths of which some were of 4-element pre-war Zeiss Sonnar design with the cemented second and ultra-fat third element.\n\n==Camera models==\n\n===Early cameras===\nBottom Loading\n* Zenit (1953\u201356)\n* Zenit-S (S stands for flash sync, 1955\u201361)\n* Zenit-3 (1960\u201362)\n\nHinged Back\n* Kristall/Crystal (1961\u201362)\n* Zenit-3M (modified Kristall, 1962\u201370)\n\n==={{anchor|Zenit 4|Zenit 5|Zenit 6}}Zenit 4 line semiautomatic cameras===\n* Zenit 4\n* Zenit 5\n* Zenit 6\n\n{{anchor|Zenit DKL-mount lenses}}List of Zenit DKL-mount (\"\u0411\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0426\") lenses:\n\n*Mir-1\u0426 37mm f2.8\n*Vega-3 50mm f2.8\n*Helios-65\u0426 52mm f2.8\n*Jupiter-25\u0426 85mm f2.8\n*Tair-38\u0426 133mm f2.8\n*Rubin-1\u0426 37-80mm f2.8\n\n===Zenit-E line===\n\n====Models with a Selenium cell lightmeter====\n[[File:Zenith by RustedStrings.jpg|thumb|Zenit ET with Helios 44-2 lens]]\n[[File:Zenit-E 0544.jpg|thumb|Zenit-E]]\n[[File:Zenit 12XP.jpg|thumb|Zenit 12xp]]\n[[File:Zenit TTL (front top angle).jpg|thumb|Zenit TTL]]\n* Zenit-E\n* Zenit-EM, Produced between 1972-1984 by KMZ.\n* Zenit-ET\n* Zenit-10\n* Zenit-11\n\n====Models without a Selenium lightmeter====\n* Zenit-V, also known as Zenit-B (identical to the E but no lightmeter)\n* Zenit-VM, also known as Zenit-BM (identical to the EM but no lightmeter)\n\n====Cameras with TTL-metering and M42 thread mount====\n[[File:Zenit 412.jpg|thumb|Zenit 412, one of the last models]]\n* Zenit-TTL\n* Zenit-12\n* Zenit-12xp, Zenit-12sd\n* Zenit-122\n* Zenit-122V, also known as Zenit-122B\n* Zenit-312m\n* Zenit-412DX\n* Zenit-412LS\n\n====Cameras with TTL-metering and Pentax K mount====\n* Zenit-122K\n* Zenit-212K\n\n===Cameras with non-standard mounts===\n* Start\n* Zenit-7\n* Zenit-D\n\n===M42 semi-automatic cameras===\n* Zenit-16\n* Zenit-19\n* Zenit-18 automatic camera\n* Zenit-MT-1 Surprise (half frame Zenit-19 variant)\n\n===Zenit-Ax line (Pentax K mount cameras)===\n[[File:Zenit am by igors jefimovs.jpg|thumb|Zenit-AM-2 camera and accessories]]\n* Zenit-Automat, also known as Zenit-Auto\n* Zenit-AM\n* Zenit-AM2\n* Zenit-APM\n* Zenit-APK\n* Zenit-KM\n* Zenit-KM plus\n\n===Zenit-DF line (Minolta / Rokkor mount cameras made by Seagull)===\n<small>Source</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subclub.org/minchin/index.htm|title=CHINA|website=www.subclub.org|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n* Zenit DF-2, same as the Seagull DF-2\n* Zenit DF-2ETM, same as the Seagull DF-2ETM\n* Zenit DF-300, same as the Seagull DF-300\n* Zenit DF-300x, same as the Seagull DF-300x2\n\n===Photosniper===\nOne oddity of the Zenit camera range is the so-called FotoSnaiper (or Photosniper) kit, which consists of a case (either leather or metal) a gunstock and shoulderstock, filters, a 300&nbsp;mm f4.5 [[Tair (lens)|Tair-3 lens]], a normal lens and a Zenit adapted for the gunstock (recognizable by the s designation, Zenit-ES, 122s etc.).

In transforming the Zorki into an SLR, the simplest approach was taken: the rangefinder housing was removed from the top and replaced by a plain ground-glass screen and prism; a mirror was added below, with a rope-and-pulley setting system  and the [[M39 lens mount|M39]]\u00d71 thread mount was pushed forward to make room for the mirror inside.\n\nDuring the first years of production (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (almost like the Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the Pentaprism of all classical Zenits was undersize, with the viewfinder showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.\n\n===Zenit-E and its successors===\n[[File:Zenit-E Camera with Industar 50mm lens.jpg|thumb|Zenit E with Industar 50-2 50/3.5 Lens and Selenium-cell lightmeter]]\n[[File:Zenit e.jpg|thumb|Zenit E with Helios 44-2 lens, made in 1971]]\nDuring 1967 through 1969 KMZ built an automatic die-cast moulding line, allowing mass camera production. Camera production switched to the [[M42 lens mount|M42\u00d71]] thread (also known as [[Praktica]] thread) and an instant-return mirror was also developed. This led to one of the most famous Zenits \u2014 '''Zenit-E''' which saw (including its subtypes) over 12 million produced. A heavy and tough camera with a mechanism that was of exceedingly simple design along the lines of \"what isn't there, can't go wrong\".  Automatic diaphragm functionality was not available until the introduction of the Zenit-EM, which used a direct mechanism linking the shutter release button to the aperture mechanism, significantly increasing the effort required to release the shutter.  Production included both M39\u00d71 and M42\u00d71 mounts for the Zenit E and [[Zenit B]] models.  Later models were only produced in the M42\u00d71 with the Pentax K mount available for the latest models.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, the Zenit-E heritage became an obstacle to the development of more modern Zenit models. This was because almost all low-end Zenits until the recent 412DX have been based on the Zenit-E die-cast chassis, complying with the local philosophy that a crude but affordable camera was better than no camera.\n{{anchor|zenit_ttl}}<!-- Used for [[Zenit TTL]] redirect linking to subsection here -->\nThe major events of the further development of Zenit-E line was:\n*Introduction of an automatic 'jumping' [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] on the '''Zenit-EM'''\n*[[Through-the-lens|TTL]] metering system (instead of a non-coupled Selenium-cell lightmeter) on the '''Zenit-TTL'''\n*Switching to the [[Pentax K mount]] \u2014 '''Zenit-122K'''\n*DX-code introduction (instead of manual ISO-speed switch) \u2014 '''Zenit-412DX'''\n\nThe Zenit-E was also sold with the [[Moscow 1980 Olympics]] emblem.\n\n===Advanced models===\n[[File:Zenit 122 camera.jpg|thumb|Zenit 122]]\nThe first attempt to make high-end professional camera by KMZ was the '''Start''' in 1958. This camera had a full set of shutter speeds (from 1 sec to 1/1000), a lens with an automatic diaphragm in a unique [[breech-lock]] mount, and even a knife for cutting-off part of the unexposed film. The photographer could choose between a pentaprism and waist-level finders. The grave disadvantage of the Start is blamed on lack of lenses; only one lens (the [[Helios (lens brand)|Helios]]-44 f2/58) was ever made for the proprietary Start mount directly.\n\nWith the success of the Zeiss-Ikon Contaflex of the mid-1950s and its follow-ups in form of the Bessamatic, Retina- and Paxette-reflex, Zenit's next attempt was the '''Zenit-4''' (1964), '''-5''' and '''-6''' cameras. These were based on a [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] Bessamatic-type mount with Compur-type iris-shutter near the lens elements. The poor durability and high manufacturing cost of this concept in contrast to the classical barebone Zenit design based on ultimate simplicity showed KMZ to have taken a wrong track: Nevertheless, the Zenit-5 was the first Soviet motor-driven SLR camera, and the first Soviet zoom lens (Rubin-1c 2.8/37\u201380, based on [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] Zoomar design) featured in the '''Zenit-6'''.\n\nFollowing this, there were two more attempts to make high-end photographic equipment, namely the '''Zenit-7''' (1968) and '''Zenit-D''' (1969). Both were based on the completely new cloth-curtain shutter construction. The '''Zenit-D''' had automatic exposure mode. Its shutter was sped up to achieve X-sync at 1/125. Each of these had its own bayonet mount (\"mount 7\" and \"mount D\" respectively) which helped to utilize the camera's most advanced features. There were plans to develop a full line of optics for these cameras but the new shutter was too complicated and unreliable. Production was cancelled shortly after, and the only lens made for new mounts were the standard types. The '''Start''', '''Zenit-7''' and '''Zenit-D''' utilized the same normal lens \u2014 a Helios-44 2/58. The Zenit-D is one of the rarest Zenit cameras \u2014 only 63 cameras were produced.\n\nThe Zenit 12-XP With its Helios f2/58mm lens and cloth shutter was widely sold by US Eastern camera stores. Many with the Zenit name covered with their \"USA\" brand. This Metallic re-badge was easy enough to gently pry off to see the true name Zenit. The TTL meter was fairly accurate and took decent shots. The 1981 price was $110 usa. The Russians believed that 58mm more closely matched the Human normal range than the standard 50mm used worldwide as a normal lens. It also had a T setting for timed exposures making it a good choice for yearly fireworks displays. The \"T\" setting locked the shutter open allowing a tripod mounted camera to be used with an index card to manually open for few bursts of fire works and then close and reset.\n\nAfter one more unsuccessful camera ('''Zenit-16''') which was produced in very small quantities, in 1979 production of the '''Zenit-19''' began. This was a camera with an original electromagnet-driven focal-plane shutter, M42 lens mount, and shutter speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000.  X-sync at 1/60 or 1/125 (camera was modified during production). The camera has only manual shooting mode (with a TTL-meter and a needle indicator of the proper exposition in the viewfinder). The Zenit-19 was, perhaps, the top-of-the-line Soviet [[M42 lens mount]] camera.\n\n===Pentax-K mount series===\nIn 1984 the '''Zenit-automat''' entered production. This had a [[Pentax K mount]] (which was proposed as an [[open standard]] by [[Pentax]] and distributed freely{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}) and a focal shutter with horizontal-travel cloth curtains. The only operation mode was [[aperture-priority]]. The camera was modified in 1988, to include shutter FZL-84 with vertical-travel metal curtains, and was reissued as the '''Zenit-AM'''. The '''Zenit-AM2''' was a cheaper version of the AM without the self-timer.\n\nNext in line was the '''Zenit-APK'''. Its distinguishing feature was the introduction of a manual shutter mode in addition to aperture-priority. The original FZL-84 shutter was also changed to a licensed 'Copal Square' shutter.\n\nThe most recent model is the '''Zenit-KM''' of 2001. This is the second microprocessor-controlled camera in the Zenit range (the first one was the second variant of the '''Zenit-automat''' camera), and the second (after the Zenit-5) motor-driven SLR camera built by KMZ. Shutter speeds range from 1/2000 to 1 sec (and up to 16 sec in Auto mode). X-sync is 1/125 sec, and the camera includes both manual shutter and aperture-priority modes as well as DX-coding from 50 to 3200 [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. In 2004, the KM received some improvements and was renamed to the '''Zenit-KM Plus'''\n\nThe Zenit-KM Plus was the final Zenit camera to be produced; {{As of|2005|lc=on}} all SLR camera production at the Krasnogorsk factory ceased. These highly interesting ultimate Zeniths would have been major sellers on Western markets during the \"SLR-decade\" of the 1970s.{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} However, they appeared at a time when their market-segment was saturated with second-hand equipment, so no major importer looked at them{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}. One of the characteristics of Soviet camera manufacture was that the capability of its designers was well ahead of that of its policy-makers.  The 20-year overdue replacement of the external selenium cell of the Zenit E by TTL-metering is said to be the work of an employee who made a conversion on his own accord.    <!-- **** WHAT ABOUT THE BELARUS PLANT? **** **** It closed a cameras production in 1990! **** -->\n\n===Soviet Export Policy===\nIn the West, the success of the Zenit line can be focused on the United Kingdom, primarily due to the marketing activity and service of TOE, and secondly the originally heavy UK tax-load of up to two-thirds on imported precision cameras.\nSubstantial quantities were later sold by German discounters like Foto-Quelle and Neckermann. The main criticism of the USSR exporters at the time was that they could only supply hopelessly outdated equipment like the Zenit E that they had been directed to produce in quantity, despite having the capacity to produce more technically advanced products that might have been attractive to Western buyers. TOE were fighting a constant battle with their USSR-suppliers in this direction, having to fill the gap left by the excellent but not-for-export Soviet lenses which would have been a major selling-point, by a hodge-podge selection of second-rate mass-market optics from Japan, albeit under the \"Helios\" label.\n\n===Standard Zenit Lenses===\nThe original Zenit came with the sturdy click-stop four-element 3.5/50mm Zeiss Tessar copy under the \"Industar\" designation.  Early aluminium variants made in several different bodies were finely blue-coated, whereas the later mass-produced black version was either partially or un-coated with no visible colour on the glass. They were sharp but gave the typically \"foggy\" image of an uncoated lens with bright lighting.  With the iris ring sitting inside the focussing ring it was impossible to focus at full aperture followed by stopping down, as this moved the point of focus.  What makes these lenses interesting is their very compact \"pancake\" design. The concept of the makers was to offer a sharp Tessar-type lens of the simplest possible body construction, leaving out all progress made in this field since 1945.  The most prominent lens is the 6-element 2.0/58mm \"Helios\" based on the pre-war Zeiss Biotar (US Patent 1,786,916 (W.Mert\u00e9, 1930) Zenit also manufactures several [[Tair (lens)|Tair]] lenses in different focal lengths of which some were of 4-element pre-war Zeiss Sonnar design with the cemented second and ultra-fat third element.\n\n==Camera models==\n\n===Early cameras===\nBottom Loading\n* Zenit (1953\u201356)\n* Zenit-S (S stands for flash sync, 1955\u201361)\n* Zenit-3 (1960\u201362)\n\nHinged Back\n* Kristall/Crystal (1961\u201362)\n* Zenit-3M (modified Kristall, 1962\u201370)\n\n==={{anchor|Zenit 4|Zenit 5|Zenit 6}}Zenit 4 line semiautomatic cameras===\n* Zenit 4\n* Zenit 5\n* Zenit 6\n\n{{anchor|Zenit DKL-mount lenses}}List of Zenit DKL-mount (\"\u0411\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0426\") lenses:\n\n*Mir-1\u0426 37mm f2.8\n*Vega-3 50mm f2.8\n*Helios-65\u0426 52mm f2.8\n*Jupiter-25\u0426 85mm f2.8\n*Tair-38\u0426 133mm f2.8\n*Rubin-1\u0426 37-80mm f2.8\n\n===Zenit-E line===\n\n====Models with a Selenium cell lightmeter====\n[[File:Zenith by RustedStrings.jpg|thumb|Zenit ET with Helios 44-2 lens]]\n[[File:Zenit-E 0544.jpg|thumb|Zenit-E]]\n[[File:Zenit 12XP.jpg|thumb|Zenit 12XP]]\n[[File:Zenit TTL (front top angle).jpg|thumb|Zenit TTL]]\n* Zenit-E\n* Zenit-EM, Produced between 1972-1984 by KMZ.\n* Zenit-ET\n* Zenit-10\n* Zenit-11\n\n====Models without a Selenium lightmeter====\n* Zenit-V, also known as Zenit-B (identical to the E but no lightmeter)\n* Zenit-VM, also known as Zenit-BM (identical to the EM but no lightmeter)\n\n====Cameras with TTL-metering and M42 thread mount====\n[[File:Zenit 412.jpg|thumb|Zenit 412, one of the last models]]\n* Zenit-TTL\n* Zenit-12\n* Zenit-12xp, Zenit-12sd\n* Zenit-122\n* Zenit-122V, also known as Zenit-122B\n* Zenit-312m\n* Zenit-412DX\n* Zenit-412LS\n\n====Cameras with TTL-metering and Pentax K mount====\n* Zenit-122K\n* Zenit-212K\n\n===Cameras with non-standard mounts===\n* Start\n* Zenit-7\n* Zenit-D\n\n===M42 semi-automatic cameras===\n* Zenit-16\n* Zenit-19\n* Zenit-18 automatic camera\n* Zenit-MT-1 Surprise (half frame Zenit-19 variant)\n\n===Zenit-Ax line (Pentax K mount cameras)===\n[[File:Zenit am by igors jefimovs.jpg|thumb|Zenit-AM-2 camera and accessories]]\n* Zenit-Automat, also known as Zenit-Auto\n* Zenit-AM\n* Zenit-AM2\n* Zenit-APM\n* Zenit-APK\n* Zenit-KM\n* Zenit-KM plus\n\n===Zenit-DF line (Minolta / Rokkor mount cameras made by Seagull)===\n<small>Source</small><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subclub.org/minchin/index.htm|title=CHINA|website=www.subclub.org|accessdate=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n* Zenit DF-2, same as the Seagull DF-2\n* Zenit DF-2ETM, same as the Seagull DF-2ETM\n* Zenit DF-300, same as the Seagull DF-300\n* Zenit DF-300x, same as the Seagull DF-300x2\n\n===Photosniper===\nOne oddity of the Zenit camera range is the so-called FotoSnaiper (or Photosniper) kit, which consists of a case (either leather or metal) a gunstock and shoulderstock, filters, a 300&nbsp;mm f4.5 [[Tair (lens)|Tair-3 lens]], a normal lens and a Zenit adapted for the gunstock (recognizable by the s designation, Zenit-ES, 122s etc.).

Other early members included timpanist Dexter Lloyd and ex-[[The Nice|Nice]] guitarist [[David O'List]], who were replaced respectively by [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] and [[Phil Manzanera]] before the band recorded its first album (early [[Peel Sessions]] for the UK's BBC Radio 1 feature O'List's playing).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml|title= Getting Roxy Music in with 'The 'In' Crowd' \u2013 An Interview With Davy O'List|website=VivaRoxyMusic.com|date= 25 April 2004|accessdate=15 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515142126/http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nRoxy Music's first hit \"[[Virginia Plain]]\" made the UK top 5 in 1972, and was followed up with several hit singles and albums, with Ferry as their lead vocalist and instrumentalist (he taught himself the piano in his mid-twenties) and Eno contributing synthesiser backing.<ref name=\"Michael Bracewell REMAKE REMODEL\" />\n\nAfter their second album, Brian Eno left Roxy Music, leaving Ferry its undisputed leader. Ferry started a parallel solo career in 1973, initially performing cover versions of old standards on albums such as ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'' (1973) and ''[[Another Time, Another Place (Bryan Ferry album)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1974), both of which reached the UK top 5. After the concert tour in support of their fifth studio album ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', Roxy Music temporarily disbanded in 1976, though band members Paul Thompson, Phil Manzanera and [[Eddie Jobson]] took part in recording Ferry's subsequent solo material. That year Ferry covered the Beatles' \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" for the transitory musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''. He released three solo albums during this period, ''[[Let's Stick Together]]'' (1976), ''[[In Your Mind (album)|In Your Mind]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (album)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]'' (1978). All three albums reached the UK top 20.\n\nRoxy Music reformed at the end of 1978 to record tracks for their sixth studio album ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', which was released in early 1979 and reached no. 7 in the UK album charts, with Ferry, Manzanera, Thompson and Mackay. The follow-up was 1980's ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'', which reached no. 1 in the UK album charts, two years before the group's final studio release ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' in 1982, which also reached no. 1 in the UK album charts.<ref>{{cite news\n| url= http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/history/uk_charts.shtml\n| title= Bryan Ferry & Roxy Music UK chart statistics\n| website=Roxyrama.com\n}}</ref> The band also achieved their first and only UK no. 1 single, \"[[Jealous Guy]]\", released in 1981 as a posthumous tribute to its author [[John Lennon]], who had been murdered two months earlier. It was the only one of their singles not to be written or co-written by Ferry.\n\nAfter lengthy tours to promote the ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' album, Ferry decided to disband Roxy Music in 1983 and continue as a solo artist.\n\n===Solo years (1984\u20132001)===\nFerry's sixth solo album, ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', reached no. 1 in the UK in June 1985, and was his first and only solo studio album to top the chart.

Following the tour, Ferry teamed again with Brian Eno for ''[[Mamouna]]'' (collaborating with [[Robin Trower]] on guitar and as producer). The album took more than five years to produce, and was created under the working title ''Horoscope''. During production, Ferry simultaneously recorded and released ''[[Taxi (Bryan Ferry album)|Taxi]]'' in 1993, which proved to be a greater commercial and critical success than ''Mamouna'' when it was finally released in 1994.

The line-up was expanded to include saxophonist/oboist [[Andy Mackay]] and [[Brian Eno]], an acquaintance who owned tape recorders and played Mackay's synthesiser. Other early members included timpanist Dexter Lloyd and ex-[[The Nice|Nice]] guitarist [[David O'List]], who were replaced respectively by [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] and [[Phil Manzanera]] before the band recorded its first album (early [[Peel Sessions]] for the UK's BBC Radio 1 feature O'List's playing).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml|title= Getting Roxy Music in with 'The 'In' Crowd' \u2013 An Interview With Davy O'List|website=VivaRoxyMusic.com|date= 25 April 2004|accessdate=15 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515142126/http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 15 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nRoxy Music's first hit \"[[Virginia Plain]]\" made the UK top 5 in 1972, and was followed up with several hit singles and albums, with Ferry as their lead vocalist and instrumentalist (he taught himself the piano in his mid-twenties) and Eno contributing synthesiser backing.<ref name=\"Michael Bracewell REMAKE REMODEL\" />\n\nAfter their second album, Brian Eno left Roxy Music, leaving Ferry its undisputed leader. Ferry started a parallel solo career in 1973, initially performing cover versions of old standards on albums such as ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'' (1973) and ''[[Another Time, Another Place (Bryan Ferry album)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1974), both of which reached the UK top 5. After the concert tour in support of their fifth studio album ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'', Roxy Music temporarily disbanded in 1976, though band members Paul Thompson, Phil Manzanera and [[Eddie Jobson]] took part in recording Ferry's subsequent solo material. That year Ferry covered the Beatles' \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" for the transitory musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''. He released three solo albums during this period, ''[[Let's Stick Together]]'' (1976), ''[[In Your Mind (album)|In Your Mind]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (album)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]'' (1978). All three albums reached the UK top 20.\n\nRoxy Music reformed at the end of 1978 to record tracks for their sixth studio album ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', which was released in early 1979 and reached no. 7 in the UK album charts, with Ferry, Manzanera, Thompson and Mackay. The follow-up was 1980's ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'', which reached no. 1 in the UK album charts, two years before the group's final studio release ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' in 1982, which also reached no. 1 in the UK album charts.<ref>{{cite news\n| url= http://www.roxyrama.com/classic/history/uk_charts.shtml\n| title= Bryan Ferry & Roxy Music UK chart statistics\n| website=Roxyrama.com\n}}</ref> The band also achieved their first and only UK no. 1 single, \"[[Jealous Guy]]\", released in 1981 as a posthumous tribute to its author [[John Lennon]], who had been murdered two months earlier. It was the only one of their singles not to be written or co-written by Ferry.\n\nAfter lengthy tours to promote the ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' album, Ferry decided to disband Roxy Music in 1983 and continue as a solo artist.\n\n===Solo years (1984\u20132001)===\nFerry's sixth solo album, ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', reached no. 1 in the UK in June 1985, and was his first and only solo studio album to top the chart.

Following the tour, Ferry teamed again with Brian Eno for ''[[Mamouna]]'' (collaborating with [[Robin Trower]] on guitar and as producer). The album took more than five years to produce, and was created under the working title ''Horoscope''. During production, Ferry simultaneously recorded and released ''[[Taxi (Bryan Ferry album)|Taxi]]'' in 1993, which proved to be a greater commercial and critical success than ''Mamouna'' when it was finally released in 1994. In 1996, Ferry performed the song \"Dance with Life\" for the ''[[Phenomenon (film)|Phenomenon]]'' soundtrack, written by [[Bernie Taupin]] and [[Martin Page]]. \n[[File:Bryanferrygf.JPG|thumb|centre|upright=3|Bryan Ferry onstage at [[Guilfest]] 2012, with backing from [[Johnny Marr]] and [[Chris Spedding]]]]\nIn 1999, Ferry released ''[[As Time Goes By (Bryan Ferry album)|As Time Goes By]]'', an album of 1930s songs, which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite news\n| url= http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/03/grammy.nominations.02/index.html\n| title= Diversity marks Grammy nominations\n| publisher=CNN\n| date= 3 January 2001\n| accessdate=30 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Roxy Music reunion (2001\u20132011)===\nFerry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson re-reformed Roxy Music in 2001 and toured extensively for a couple of years, though the band did not record any new material.

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel.

Reviewer Wolfgang Gruener said \"The Settings menu isn't quite as messy anymore and looks much more like what you would expect from a professionally designed software.\" Language and spell checking support was expanded to 100 languages. Chromium 11 used WebKit 534.18 and V8 3.1.1 which resulted in improved speed in JavaScript and other benchmark tests.

Under consideration were eliminating the \"Omnibox\" URL bar and combining the two-line layout which has tabs on one line and navigation buttons, a menu and URL bar on a second line into one single line, thus freeing up more screen space for content. (Such a layout was later adopted by [[Internet Explorer 9]].) Chang acknowledged that this would result in URLs not always being visible to the user, that navigation controls and menus may lose their context and that the resulting single line could be quite crowded.

Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 JavaScript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher would be added during the development cycle. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the ''history quick provider'' was introduced.

The size is a concern to developers, who have noted that Chrome 1 was 9.0 MB in Windows download size, compared to Chrome 10 for Windows at 26.2 MB, as a result they have created a \"bloat taskforce\". Larger download sizes are a problem for a number of reasons, as Chrome Developer Ian Fette explained: \"1. We do distribution deals with Chrome, where we bundle Chrome with other products. These get difficult when our binary grows. 2. We see increased download failures/ install dropoffs as the binary grows, especially in countries with poor bandwidth like India. India also happens to be a very good market for Chrome (we have good market share there and growing), so that's also very problematic.\"<ref name=\"Gruener22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |title= Google Chrome in 2011: The Biggest Loser?|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120818111245/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |archivedate= 18 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Shankland22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20045776-264.html|title= Google working to reverse Chrome bloat|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Shankland|first= Stephen|authorlink= |date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of Chromium 12.0.742.0 on 19 April 2011 the interface incorporated many changes, the most significant since Chromium 6 was released.

Users have argued that it would protect against co-workers or family members borrowing a computer and seeing the stored passwords in clear text. In December 2009, Chromium developer P. Kasting stated: \"A master password was issue 1397. That issue is closed. We will not implement a master password. Not now, not ever. Arguing for it won't make it happen.

Reviewer Wolfgang Gruener said \"The Settings menu isn't quite as messy anymore and looks much more like what you would expect from a professionally designed software.\" Language and spell checking support was expanded to 100 languages. Chromium 11 used WebKit 534.18 and V8 3.1.1 which resulted in improved speed in JavaScript and other benchmark tests. In early testing Chromium 11 was faster than [[Firefox 4]] in V8 and Kraken benchmarks, but was 12% slower than [[Internet Explorer 9]] in [[WebKit|Sunspider]] tests.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /><ref name=\"Gruener04Feb11\" />\n\nIn February 2011, Google's Jeff Chang announced to Chromium developers that Google was considering further large-scale interface changes. Under consideration were eliminating the \"Omnibox\" URL bar and combining the two-line layout which has tabs on one line and navigation buttons, a menu and URL bar on a second line into one single line, thus freeing up more screen space for content. (Such a layout was later adopted by [[Internet Explorer 9]].) Chang acknowledged that this would result in URLs not always being visible to the user, that navigation controls and menus may lose their context and that the resulting single line could be quite crowded. Other proposed changes include being able to log into multiple accounts in different windows and improved URL suggestions from the user's history.<ref name=\"Gruener20Feb11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar|title= Google May Kill Chrome URL Bar|access-date= 6 February 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=February 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130326023943/http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar |archivedate= 26 March 2013}}</ref> By the middle of 2011, after some experimentation, the developers decided that eliminating the URL bar was too risky and shelved the idea.<ref name=\"Gruener09Aug11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/8765/products/google-shelves-hidden-location-bar|title= Google Shelves Hidden Location Bar|access-date= 9 August 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=August 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211012/http://www.conceivablytech.com/8765/products/google-shelves-hidden-location-bar |archivedate= 6 April 2012}}</ref> Chromium 11 also introduced a new simplified 2D logo that replaced the 3D logo used from the project since its inception.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.techspot.com/news/42848-google-chrome-and-chromium-to-get-new-logos.html|title= Google Chrome and Chromium to get new logos|access-date=2017-12-10|last= Protalinski|first= Emil|authorlink= |date=2011-03-16 |work= Conceivably Tech}}</ref>\n\n[[Mageia]] first offered Chromium 11 in Mageia v1 during 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mageia |url=https://www.mageia.org/en/1/notes/ |title=Mageia 1 Release Notes |publisher=Mageia.org |date=2011-01-18 |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/19367930/dir/mandriva_2011/com/chromium-browser-stable-13.0.782.215-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm.html |title=RPM Mandriva 2011 chromium-browser-stable 13.0.782.215 i586 rpm |publisher=Rpm.pbone.net |date=2011-08-23 |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref>\n\nChromium 12.0 was released on 11 March 2011, with 12.0.700.0 as the first version.

Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 JavaScript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher would be added during the development cycle. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the ''history quick provider'' was introduced.

Development priorities focus on reducing the browser's size, integrating web applications and plug-ins, cloud capabilities and touch interface. The size is a concern to developers, who have noted that Chrome 1 was 9.0 MB in Windows download size, compared to Chrome 10 for Windows at 26.2 MB, as a result they have created a \"bloat taskforce\". Larger download sizes are a problem for a number of reasons, as Chrome Developer Ian Fette explained: \"1. We do distribution deals with Chrome, where we bundle Chrome with other products. These get difficult when our binary grows. 2. We see increased download failures/ install dropoffs as the binary grows, especially in countries with poor bandwidth like India. India also happens to be a very good market for Chrome (we have good market share there and growing), so that's also very problematic.\"<ref name=\"Gruener22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |title= Google Chrome in 2011: The Biggest Loser?|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120818111245/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |archivedate= 18 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Shankland22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20045776-264.html|title= Google working to reverse Chrome bloat|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Shankland|first= Stephen|authorlink= |date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of Chromium 12.0.742.0 on 19 April 2011 the interface incorporated many changes, the most significant since Chromium 6 was released.

Dan Bailey of ''Conceivably Tech'' stated about this version and the development of it, \"it is obvious that Google is plugging along and is fine-tuning its browser&nbsp;\u2026 Chrome isn't surrendering its perception of the most advanced browser today anytime soon.\" As development wound up in early September 2011 Chromium 15 also gained a \"self-crashing\" feature that crashes the browser if a close command is not completed in 25 seconds, smooth scrolling when using the space bar, automatic pre- and auto-logins to Google's own web pages, task bar logos to show different profiles, greatly enhanced synchronization customization, including optional search engine synchronization and improvements to the pre-rendering process.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /><ref name=\"Bailey28July11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/8557/products/preview-chrome-15-why-google-has-the-edge|title= Preview Chrome 15: Why Google Has The Edge|access-date= 14 July 2011|last= Bailey|first= Dan|authorlink= |date=July 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211227/http://www.conceivablytech.com/8557/products/preview-chrome-15-why-google-has-the-edge |archivedate= 6 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Bailey06Sep11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/9253/products/chrome-gets-a-suicide-feature|title= Chrome Gets A Suicide Feature|access-date= 7 September 2011|last= Bailey|first= Dan|authorlink= |date=September 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130124164111/http://www.conceivablytech.com/9253/products/chrome-gets-a-suicide-feature |archivedate= 24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nChromium 16.0 was released on 10 September 2011, with 16.0.877.0 as the initial version.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /> Early in the development of version 16 an experimental Offscreen Tabs Module was incorporated which allows simultaneous user interaction with multiple web pages.

Shortly after Sabah's death, in 1766, the al-Khalifa and, soon after, the al-Jalahima, left Kuwait en masse for [[Zubara]] in Qatar. Domestically, the al-Khalifa and al-Jalahima had been among the top contenders for power. Their emigration left the Sabahs in undisputed control, and by the end of Abdullah I's long rule (1762\u20131812), Sabah rule was secure, and the political hierarchy in Kuwait was well established, the merchants deferring to direct orders from the Shaikh. By the 19th century, not only was the ruling Sabah much stronger than a desert Shaikh but also capable of naming his son successor. This influence was not just internal but enabled the al-Sabah to conduct foreign diplomacy. They soon established good relations with the British East India Company in 1775.<ref name=\"locrule\" />\n\n;The assassination of Muhammad Bin Sabah\nAlthough Kuwait was nominally governed from Basra, the Kuwaitis had traditionally maintained a relative degree of autonomous status.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Harvnb|Anscombe|1997|p={{page needed|date=September 2010}}}}</ref> In the 1870s, Ottoman officials were reasserting their presence in the Persian Gulf, with a military intervention in 1871\u2014which was not effectively pursued\u2014where family rivalries in Kuwait were breeding chaos. The Ottomans were bankrupt and when the European banks took control of the Ottoman budget in 1881, additional income was required from Kuwait and the Arabian peninsula. Midhat Pasha, the governor of Iraq, demanded that Kuwait submit to Ottoman rule. The al-Sabah found diplomatic allies in the British Foreign Office. However, under [[Abdullah II Al-Sabah]], Kuwait pursued a general pro-Ottoman foreign policy, formally taking the title of Ottoman provincial governor, this relationship with the Ottoman Empire did result in Ottoman interference with Kuwaiti laws and selection or rulers.<ref name=\"locrule\"/> In May 1896, [[Shaikh]] [[Muhammad Al-Sabah]] was assassinated by his half-brother, Mubarak, who, in early 1897, was recognized, by the Ottoman sultan, as the ''qaimmaqam'' (provincial sub-governor) of Kuwait.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n;Mubarak the Great\n{{main|Mubarak Al-Sabah}}\n[[File:Mubarak Al-Sabah of Kuwait.jpg|thumb|[[Mubarak Al-Sabah]] \"the Great\" (1837\u20131915)]] \nMubarak's seizure of the throne via murder left his brother's former allies as a threat to his rule, especially as his opponents gained the backing of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"locrule\" /> In July, Mubarak invited the British to deploy [[gunboat]]s along the Kuwaiti coast. Britain saw Mubarak's desire for an alliance as an opportunity to counteract German influence in the region and so agreed.<ref name=\"locrule\" /> This led to what is known as the First Kuwaiti Crisis, in which the Ottomans demanded that the British stop interfering with their empire. In the end, the Ottoman Empire backed down, rather than go to war.\n\nIn January 1899, Mubarak signed an agreement with the British which pledged that Kuwait would never cede any territory nor receive agents or representatives of any foreign power without the British Government's consent. In essence, this policy gave Britain control of Kuwait's foreign policy.<ref name=\"locrule\"/> The treaty also gave Britain responsibility for Kuwait's national security. In return, Britain agreed to grant an annual subsidy of 15,000 Indian [[rupee]]s (\u00a31,500) to the ruling family. In 1911, Mubarak raised taxes. Therefore, three wealthy business men [[Ibrahim Al-Mudhaf]], [[Helal Al-Mutairi]], and Shamlan Ali bin Saif Al-Roumi (brother of Hussain Ali bin Saif Al-Roumi), led a protest against Mubarak by making [[Bahrain]] their main trade point, which negatively affected the Kuwaiti economy. However, Mubarak went to Bahrain and apologized for raising taxes and the three business men returned to Kuwait. In 1915, Mubarak the Great died and was succeeded by his son [[Jaber II Al-Sabah]], who reigned for just over one year until his death in early 1917. His brother Sheikh Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah succeeded him.\n\n==Anglo-Ottoman convention (1913)==\nIn the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], the British concurred with the Ottoman Empire in defining Kuwait as an autonomous [[kaza]] of the Ottoman Empire and that the Shaikhs of Kuwait were not independent leaders, but rather ''qaimmaqams'' (provincial sub-governors) of the Ottoman government.\n\nThe convention ruled that Sheikh Mubarak had authority over an area extending out to a radius of 80&nbsp;km, from the capital. This region was marked by a red circle and included the islands of [[Auhah Island|Auhah]], [[Bubiyan]], Failaka, [[Kubbar Island|Kubbar]], Mashian, and [[Warbah Island|Warbah]]. A green circle designated an area extending out an additional 100&nbsp;km, in radius, within which the ''qaimmaqam'' was authorized to collect [[tribute]] and taxes from the natives.\n\n[[World War I]] disrupted elements of Kuwait's  politics, society, economy and trans-regional networks.<ref>John Slight,  \"Global War and its impact on the Gulf States of Kuwait and Bahrain, 1914\u20131918.\" ''War & Society'' 37#1 (2018): 21-37.  https://doi.org/10.1080/07292473.2017.1412185</ref>\n\n==Kuwait\u2013Najd War (1919\u201321)==\n{{main|Kuwait\u2013Najd War}}\nThe Kuwait-Najd War erupted in the [[aftermath of World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was defeated and the British invalidated the Anglo-Ottoman Convention.

In April 1923, Shaikh [[Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah|Ahmad al-Sabah]] wrote the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Major [[John More (major)|John More]], \"I still do not know what the border between Iraq and Kuwait is, I shall be glad if you will kindly give me this information.\" More, upon learning that al-Sabah claimed the outer green line of the Anglo-Ottoman Convention (4 April), would relay the information to Sir Percy.\n\nOn 19 April, Sir Percy stated that the British government recognized the outer line of the Convention as the border between Iraq and Kuwait. This decision limited Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf at 58&nbsp;km of mostly marshy and swampy coastline. As this would make it difficult for Iraq to become a naval power (the territory did not include any deepwater harbours), the Iraqi King [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] (whom the British installed as a puppet king in Iraq) did not agree to the plan. However, as his country was under British mandate, he had little say in the matter. Iraq and Kuwait would formally ratify the border in August. The border was re-recognized in 1932.\n\nIn 1913, Kuwait was recognized as a separate province from Iraq and given autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the draft Anglo-Ottoman Convention, however this was not signed before the outbreak of the first World War. The border was revisited by a memorandum sent by the British high commissioner for Iraq in 1923, which became the basis for Kuwait's northern border.

Shortly after Sabah's death, in 1766, the al-Khalifa and, soon after, the al-Jalahima, left Kuwait en masse for [[Zubara]] in Qatar. Domestically, the al-Khalifa and al-Jalahima had been among the top contenders for power. Their emigration left the Sabahs in undisputed control, and by the end of Abdullah I's long rule (1762\u20131812), Sabah rule was secure, and the political hierarchy in Kuwait was well established, the merchants deferring to direct orders from the Shaikh. By the 19th century, not only was the ruling Sabah much stronger than a desert Shaikh but also capable of naming his son successor. This influence was not just internal but enabled the al-Sabah to conduct foreign diplomacy. They soon established good relations with the British East India Company in 1775.<ref name=\"locrule\" />\n\n;The assassination of Muhammad Bin Sabah\nAlthough Kuwait was nominally governed from Basra, the Kuwaitis had traditionally maintained a relative degree of autonomous status.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Harvnb|Anscombe|1997|p={{page needed|date=September 2010}}}}</ref> In the 1870s, Ottoman officials were reasserting their presence in the Persian Gulf, with a military intervention in 1871\u2014which was not effectively pursued\u2014where family rivalries in Kuwait were breeding chaos. The Ottomans were bankrupt and when the European banks took control of the Ottoman budget in 1881, additional income was required from Kuwait and the Arabian peninsula. Midhat Pasha, the governor of Iraq, demanded that Kuwait submit to Ottoman rule. The al-Sabah found diplomatic allies in the British Foreign Office. However, under [[Abdullah II Al-Sabah]], Kuwait pursued a general pro-Ottoman foreign policy, formally taking the title of Ottoman provincial governor, this relationship with the Ottoman Empire did result in Ottoman interference with Kuwaiti laws and selection or rulers.<ref name=\"locrule\"/> In May 1896, [[Shaikh]] [[Muhammad Al-Sabah]] was assassinated by his half-brother, Mubarak, who, in early 1897, was recognized, by the Ottoman sultan, as the ''qaimmaqam'' (provincial sub-governor) of Kuwait.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n;Mubarak the Great\n{{main|Mubarak Al-Sabah}}\n[[File:Mubarak Al-Sabah of Kuwait.jpg|thumb|[[Mubarak Al-Sabah]] \"the Great\" (1837\u20131915)]] \nMubarak's seizure of the throne via murder left his brother's former allies as a threat to his rule, especially as his opponents gained the backing of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"locrule\" /> In July, Mubarak invited the British to deploy [[gunboat]]s along the Kuwaiti coast. Britain saw Mubarak's desire for an alliance as an opportunity to counteract German influence in the region and so agreed.<ref name=\"locrule\" /> This led to what is known as the First Kuwaiti Crisis, in which the Ottomans demanded that the British stop interfering with their empire. In the end, the Ottoman Empire backed down, rather than go to war.\n\nIn January 1899, Mubarak signed an agreement with the British which pledged that Kuwait would never cede any territory nor receive agents or representatives of any foreign power without the British Government's consent. In essence, this policy gave Britain control of Kuwait's foreign policy.<ref name=\"locrule\"/> The treaty also gave Britain responsibility for Kuwait's national security. In return, Britain agreed to grant an annual subsidy of 15,000 Indian [[rupee]]s (\u00a31,500) to the ruling family. In 1911, Mubarak raised taxes. Therefore, three wealthy business men [[Ibrahim Al-Mudhaf]], [[Helal Al-Mutairi]], and Shamlan Ali bin Saif Al-Roumi (brother of Hussain Ali bin Saif Al-Roumi), led a protest against Mubarak by making [[Bahrain]] their main trade point, which negatively affected the Kuwaiti economy. However, Mubarak went to Bahrain and apologized for raising taxes and the three business men returned to Kuwait. In 1915, Mubarak the Great died and was succeeded by his son [[Jaber II Al-Sabah]], who reigned for just over one year until his death in early 1917. His brother Sheikh Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah succeeded him.\n\n==Anglo-Ottoman convention (1913)==\nIn the [[Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913]], the British concurred with the Ottoman Empire in defining Kuwait as an autonomous [[kaza]] of the Ottoman Empire and that the Shaikhs of Kuwait were not independent leaders, but rather ''qaimmaqams'' (provincial sub-governors) of the Ottoman government.\n\nThe convention ruled that Sheikh Mubarak had authority over an area extending out to a radius of 80&nbsp;km, from the capital. This region was marked by a red circle and included the islands of [[Auhah Island|Auhah]], [[Bubiyan]], Failaka, [[Kubbar Island|Kubbar]], Mashian, and [[Warbah Island|Warbah]]. A green circle designated an area extending out an additional 100&nbsp;km, in radius, within which the ''qaimmaqam'' was authorized to collect [[tribute]] and taxes from the natives.\n\n[[World War I]] disrupted elements of Kuwait's  politics, society, economy and trans-regional networks.<ref>John Slight,  \"Global War and its impact on the Gulf States of Kuwait and Bahrain, 1914\u20131918.\" ''War & Society'' 37#1 (2018): 21-37.  https://doi.org/10.1080/07292473.2017.1412185</ref>\n\n==Kuwait\u2013Najd War (1919\u201321)==\n{{main|Kuwait\u2013Najd War}}\nThe Kuwait-Najd War erupted in the [[aftermath of World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was defeated and the British invalidated the Anglo-Ottoman Convention.

In April 1923, Shaikh [[Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah|Ahmad al-Sabah]] wrote the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Major [[John More (major)|John More]], \"I still do not know what the border between Iraq and Kuwait is, I shall be glad if you will kindly give me this information.\" More, upon learning that al-Sabah claimed the outer green line of the Anglo-Ottoman Convention (4 April), would relay the information to Sir Percy.\n\nOn 19 April, Sir Percy stated that the British government recognized the outer line of the Convention as the border between Iraq and Kuwait. This decision limited Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf at 58&nbsp;km of mostly marshy and swampy coastline. As this would make it difficult for Iraq to become a naval power (the territory did not include any deepwater harbours), the Iraqi King [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] (whom the British installed as a puppet king in Iraq) did not agree to the plan. However, as his country was under British mandate, he had little say in the matter. Iraq and Kuwait would formally ratify the border in August. The border was re-recognized in 1932.\n\nIn 1913, Kuwait was recognized as a separate province from Iraq and given autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the draft Anglo-Ottoman Convention, however this was not signed before the outbreak of the first World War. The border was revisited by a memorandum sent by the British high commissioner for Iraq in 1923, which became the basis for Kuwait's northern border. In Iraq's 1932 application to the League of Nations it included information about its borders, including its border with Kuwait, where it accepted the boundary established in 1923.<ref name=locpgw>{{cite web|last=Crystal|first=Jill|title=Kuwait \u2013 Persian Gulf War|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/32.htm|work=The Persian Gulf States: A Country Study|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Modern era==\n\n===Golden era (1946\u201382)===\nBetween 1946 and 1982, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its [[Liberalism|liberal atmosphere]]; this period is called the \"golden era\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gonzales |first=Desi |date=November\u2013December 2014 |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition |url=http://www.artpapers.org/feature_articles/feature3_2014_1112.html |journal=[[Art Papers]] |access-date=29 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426171107/http://www.artpapers.org/feature_articles/feature3_2014_1112.html |archive-date=26 April 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=venezia>{{cite book |url={{google books|201yBgAAQBAJ|page=7|plainurl=yes}} |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait's Modern Era Between Memory and Forgetting  |date=2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters |isbn=9789990604238}}</ref><ref name=pavilion>{{cite web |editor-first=Farah |editor-last=Al-Nakib | url= https://www.academia.edu/8186917 |title=Kuwait's Modernity Between Memory and Forgetting |website=Academia.edu |date=2014 |page=7}}</ref><ref name=farid>{{cite web |author=[[Alia Farid]] |url=http://aliafarid.net/Art-Papers |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition |website=aliafarid.net |date=2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221184242/http://aliafarid.net/Art-Papers |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1950, a major public-work programme allowed Kuwaitis to enjoy a modern standard of living.

As a student he was active in protests against the [[Bantu Education Act]]. He worked as a clerk for a law firm. Following his graduation, he joined [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. Following his arrest under the [[Suppression of Communism Act]], he went into exile in [[Lesotho]] in 1963.<ref name=about.com/> Because of Hani's involvement with Umkhonto we Sizwe he was forced into hiding by the South African government during which time he changed his first name to Chris.<ref name=\"about.com\"/>\n\nHe received military training in the [[Soviet Union]] and served in campaigns in the [[Zimbabwean War of Liberation]], also called the Rhodesian Bush War. They were joint operations between [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK) and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] in the late 1960s. The Luthuli Detachment operation consolidated Hani's reputation as a soldier in the black army that took the field against apartheid and its allies. His role as a fighter from the earliest days of MK's exile (following the arrest of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the other internal MK leaders at [[Rivonia]]) was an important part in the fierce loyalty Hani enjoyed in some quarters later as MK's Deputy Commander (Joe Modise was overall commander). In 1969 he co-signed, with six others, the 'Hani Memorandum' which was strongly critical of the leadership of [[Joe Modise]], Moses Kotane and other comrades in the leadership.<ref>[http://www.transformation.ukzn.ac.za/index.php/transformation/article/view/1015/830 The \u2018Hani Memorandum\u2019 \u2013 introduced and annotated by Hugh Macmillan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125053818/http://www.transformation.ukzn.ac.za/index.php/transformation/article/view/1015/830 |date=25 January 2013 }}, ''Transformation'', 2009</ref>\n\nIn Lesotho he organised guerrilla operations of the MK in South Africa. By 1982, Hani had become prominent enough that he was the target of assassination attempts, and he eventually moved to the ANC's headquarters in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]].

As a student he was active in protests against the [[Bantu Education Act]]. He worked as a clerk for a law firm. Following his graduation, he joined [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. Following his arrest under the [[Suppression of Communism Act]], he went into exile in [[Lesotho]] in 1963.<ref name=about.com/> Because of Hani's involvement with Umkhonto we Sizwe he was forced into hiding by the South African government during which time he changed his first name to Chris.<ref name=\"about.com\"/>\n\nHe received military training in the [[Soviet Union]] and served in campaigns in the [[Zimbabwean War of Liberation]], also called the Rhodesian Bush War. They were joint operations between [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK) and the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] in the late 1960s. The Luthuli Detachment operation consolidated Hani's reputation as a soldier in the black army that took the field against apartheid and its allies. His role as a fighter from the earliest days of MK's exile (following the arrest of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the other internal MK leaders at [[Rivonia]]) was an important part in the fierce loyalty Hani enjoyed in some quarters later as MK's Deputy Commander (Joe Modise was overall commander). In 1969 he co-signed, with six others, the 'Hani Memorandum' which was strongly critical of the leadership of [[Joe Modise]], Moses Kotane and other comrades in the leadership.<ref>[http://www.transformation.ukzn.ac.za/index.php/transformation/article/view/1015/830 The \u2018Hani Memorandum\u2019 \u2013 introduced and annotated by Hugh Macmillan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125053818/http://www.transformation.ukzn.ac.za/index.php/transformation/article/view/1015/830 |date=25 January 2013 }}, ''Transformation'', 2009</ref>\n\nIn Lesotho he organised guerrilla operations of the MK in South Africa.

The introduction to the song in this latter form, a popular hit in 2001, starts with the crowd singing the \"Honey\" line, and the crowd and band occasionally use the reprise as an outro to the song as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmbalmanac.com/SongStats.aspx?sid=36|title=Song Listing for ''\"#36\"''|publisher=DMBAlmanac.com\u00b2}}</ref><ref>Martell, Nevin. \"Dave Matthews Band: Music for the People\", p. 57.
