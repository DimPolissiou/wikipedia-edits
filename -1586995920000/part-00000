It is on Suffolk's border with [[Essex]], which is marked by the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]], approximately {{convert|16|mi|km|}} from [[Colchester]] and {{convert|14|mi|km}} from [[Bury St Edmunds]]. It is one of Suffolk's \"wool towns\" and is a former market town. The parish also includes the hamlets of Bridge Street and Cuckoo Tye.\n\nIts name is derived from the nature of the village's layout (originally concentrated along a 3-mile stretch of a single road) and the [[Watermill|Mill]] [[ford (crossing)|ford]] crossing the Chad Brook (a tributary of the River Stour).\n\n== History ==\nPrehistoric finds discovered in 2011 have shown that early settlement of what is now known as Long Melford\ndates back to the Mesolithic period, up to 8300 BC. In addition, Iron Age finds were made in the same year, and again were found within the largely central area of the current village.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] constructed two [[Roman Road|roads]] through Long Melford, the main one running from [[Chelmsford]] to [[Pakenham, Suffolk|Pakenham]]. Roman remains were discovered in a gravel pit in 1828,<ref name=Kelly>{{Cite journal|title=Kelly's Directory of Suffolk|publisher=Kelly's Directories, Ltd.|page=259|author=Kelly|year=1900|accessdate=21 October 2008|url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/EXE/tiff2png.exe/00005RE2.PNG?-i+-r+80+-g+4+-h+1,130,3+E%3A%5CZYIMAGE%5CDATA%5CHISTDIR%5CTIF%5CLU8FD8%7E1%5C00005RE2.TIF}}</ref> a site now occupied by the village's [[Association football|football]] club. Roman finds in recent years included complete skeletons, a stone coffin, part of the original Roman Road, complete Samian pottery and a Spartan Sword unearthed in a villager's garden.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn June 2013, some archaeological evidence of a [[Saxon]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlement in the northern area of the village was discovered by [[Carenza Lewis]] and her team from Cambridge University, during a student dig.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Manor of Melford was given to the [[Abbey]] of [[Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich|St. Edmundsbury]] by Earl Aflric c. 1050.<ref name=Kelly2>{{Cite journal|title=Kelly's Directory of Suffolk|publisher=Kelly's Directories, Ltd.|page=260|author=Kelly|year=1900|accessdate=21 October 2008|url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/EXE/tiff2png.exe/00005RE3.PNG?-i+-r+80+-g+4+E%3A%5CZYIMAGE%5CDATA%5CHISTDIR%5CTIF%5CLU8FD8%7E1%5C00005RE3.TIF}}</ref> The village is recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086, which lists the manor of Long Melford as an estate of 600 hectares. The neighbouring Manor of [[Kentwell Hall|Kentwell]] is also recorded. During the Middle Ages the village grew and gained a weekly market and an annual fair in 1235.\n\nLong Melford survived the Black Death in 1348-9, and was a brief stop-off in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\nBy the early 15th century, the manor of [[Kentwell]] belonged to the Clopton family. John Clopton was arrested in 1461 and charged with [[treason]]. Clopton was spared execution and he was released and returned to Kentwell.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There he organised and largely helped to pay for the rebuilding of the parish church, a notable example of a [[wool church]]. During this time the wealth of the parish was increasing, with most of the inhabitants being [[free tenant|free men]], renting their homes and lands.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Guild]]s were founded, and weaving cloth became a key part of the village's economy. In the official inspector's returns for the year 1446, there were as many as 30 named weavers in Long Melford, who between them produced 264 finished \"cloths\".\n\nFollowing the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] granted the manor to [[William Cordell|Sir William Cordell]].<ref name=Kelly2 />\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1604, an epidemic of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] arrived in Melford and 119 people died between the months of May and September. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} During the [[English Civil War]], a Puritan mob of over one thousand arrived in Melford pursuing [[Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers]], a staunch [[Catholic]] and [[Cavalier|Royalist]], from her property in [[St Osyth]] to her Suffolk estate at Melford Hall. The hall was sacked and plundered and the Countess fled to Bury St Edmunds, then to London where eventually she was imprisoned for debt and died a pauper.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, cloth production had once again become important in the area as many new entrepreneurs started to produce a range of materials known as 'Bays and Says', similar to [[baize]] and [[serge (fabric)|serge]].<ref>David Hatton, ''Clare, Suffolk, an account of historical features of the town, its Priory and its Parish Church'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-9524242-3-1}}; p. 20</ref> These were lighter, cheaper types of cloth than the traditional woollen [[broadcloth]]s that had been made in the 15th and 16th centuries but, once again, many of the cloth merchants became extremely wealthy and for some years prosperity returned to Melford.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Long Melford, Suffolk Village Website|url = http://www.longmelford.co.uk/History/|website = www.longmelford.co.uk|accessdate = 10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the beginning of the 19th century, a range of new industries such as horsehair weaving, an iron foundry, a flax works and coconut matting started in Melford. By 1851, there were three horsehair manufacturers in Melford employing over 200 men, women and children. Prince Bertie, who later became King Edward VII, together with Princess Alexandra visited the village in November 1865, and large archways were constructed at key points in their honour to welcome them in, with the crowds.\nDuring the 1880s, a series of wage cuts in the coconut industry caused widespread anger and eventually resulted in strike action. Feelings ran high, culminating in a riot breaking out on polling day in December 1885, during which considerable damage was caused throughout the village. Troops were summoned from Bury St Edmunds to restore order; they arrived by train and marched from Melford station to read the [[Riot Act]] from the steps of the Police Station.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn World War I, hundreds of village men volunteered to serve their country. They joined many diverse army regiments, such as the Scots Guards, Prince of Wales Regiment, Royal Engineers, the Suffolk Regiment, serving in Gallipoli, Ypres, the Somme and numerous military campaigns. Other men fought in the Royal Navy, and the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. In October 1920, the village war memorial was unveiled, and is located at the entrance of the Holy Trinity Church.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Long Melford was a location for American and Allied service personnel, who flew [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B24]] and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B17]] aircraft from two large bomber stations, [[RAF Lavenham]] and [[RAF Sudbury]], located nearby.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Troops from, amongst others, the [[Berkshire Regiment|Berkshire]] and [[Black Watch Regiment]]s, were billeted and garrisoned within the village.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Injured airmen, troops from the [[D-Day landings]] and [[prisoners of war]] were treated at the large nearby 136th Station Hospital, located between Long Melford and [[Acton, Suffolk|Acton]]. Band leader [[Glenn Miller]] and his orchestra briefly visited Long Melford and played to injured airmen, invited locals and hospital staff at the 136th hospital in 1944.\n\nGerman prisoners of war were interned at a camp near the 136th Station Hospital, and Italian prisoners were located at a camp at the nearby village of [[Borley]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[USAF]] personnel from bases at [[Lakenheath]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]], and [[RAF Wethersfield|Wethersfield]] airbases often lived within Long Melford.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} By the end of the war, two B24 Liberators, one B17 Flying Fortress and one RAF [[de Havilland Mosquito]] had crashed in the parish with over twenty persons killed or injured.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Numerous [[British hardened field defences of World War II#Type 22 and 27 Type 22 pillboxes|pillboxes]] and temporary gun emplacements were constructed in the village during the war, and in 2012 a previously unknown underground bunker room was located.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} According to the Remembrance Plaque at Holy Trinity Church, ninety-six serving villagers were killed in World War One, and eleven during World War Two.\n\n== Governance ==\nAn [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] in the same name exists. This ward includes [[Alpheton]] and has a total population at the 2011 Census of 3,774.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/long-melford-e05007092#sthash.ztgZoZ55.dpbs|title=Ward population 2011|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Landmarks ==\n{{Main|Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford}}\nThe great size and fine architecture of [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford|Holy Trinity Church]] make it unusual for a village [[parish church]]. It was the only church in Suffolk to receive five stars in Simon Jenkins' book \"England's Thousand Best Churches\". The church dates from the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]]; it was then substantially rebuilt between 1467 and 1497 by John Clopton of [[Kentwell Hall]]. It is one of the richest \"wool churches\" in [[East Anglia]] and is renowned for its [[flushwork]], Clopton [[chantry]] chapel and the Lady Chapel at the east end with some surviving medieval [[stained-glass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stedmundsbury.anglican.org/longmelford/|title= Holy Trinity|publisher=The Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich|accessdate=16 September 2008}}</ref> [[Edmund Blunden]], the [[World War I]] poet, is buried in the churchyard.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/collections/blunden | title=The Edmund Blunden Collection \u2013 Biography | publisher=University of Oxford | work=First World War Poetry Digital Archive | accessdate=1 November 2012 | author=Edwards, Alun}}</ref> Next to the church is the Hospital of the Holy and Blessed Trinity, an [[almshouse]] founded by [[William Cordell]] in 1573.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8koJAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA433&dq=long+melford+hospital+cordell#v=onepage&q=long%20melford%20hospital%20cordell&f=false|title=Athenae Cantabrigienses|volume=1: 1500\u20131585|page=433|author1=Charles Henry Cooper|author2=Thompson Cooper|year=1858|publisher=Deighton Bell|location=Cambridge}}</ref>\n\nAnother unusual feature of Long Melford is its large elongated village green, dominated until the 1980s by a group of great elms that included one of the largest in England.<ref>Photographs of Long Melford elms in [[Oliver Rackham]], ''A History of the Countryside'' (London, 1986) and in Francis Frith Collection, images.francisfrith.com [http://images.francisfrith.com/c10/450/39/L101004.jpg] [http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Long+Melford+pictures&view=detail&id=B480ED08C039B370BA658F832236148D7F0F8AC1&first=241&FORM=IDFRIR]</ref> The elms were painted in 1940 by the watercolourist [[Stanley Roy Badmin|S.

It is connected to several large towns by bus, notably Sudbury, Colchester, [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]] and [[Ipswich]].\n\n== Sport and leisure ==\n\nLong Melford has a [[Non-League football]] club, [[Long Melford F.C.]], which plays at Stoneylands, just off St Catherine's Road. They are members of the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]] Premier Division following promotion as champions of Division One in the 2014/15 season.\n\nLong Melford has a large water meadow on the approach to [[Liston, Essex|Liston]] and a network of footpaths. Among these paths is the Melford Walk, which follows the route of the [[Long Melford-Bury St Edmunds branch line|disused railway line]] before joining the Valley Walk path to Sudbury. The Suffolk Cycle Route also passes through the village. Located at the southern end of the village next to the River Stour in the adjoining hamlet of [[Rodbridge Corner]] is Long Melford Country Park. This was formed by gravel excavations for nearby airfields during the second world war, leaving some large, attractive lakes with wildlife habitats and walking areas for visitors.\n\nThe Long Melford Street Fair, Classic Steam Rally and the Big Night Out [[Guy Fawkes Night]] fireworks event at Melford Hall are held annually.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nLong Melford was visited by [[Daniel Defoe]], who mentioned the village in his book ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]''. Defoe wrote, \"Near adjoining to it &#91;[[Sudbury, Suffolk|Sudbury]]&#93; is a village call'd Long-Melfort, and a very long one it is, from which I suppose it had that addition to its name; it is full of very good houses, and, as they told me, is richer, and has more wealthy masters of the manufacture in it, than in Sudbury itself.\"<ref>''Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain'' was published in 3 vols. in 1724\u201326; Defoe's travels were made at various times before 1723.

The neighbouring Manor of [[Kentwell Hall|Kentwell]] is also recorded. During the Middle Ages the village grew and gained a weekly market and an annual fair in 1235.\n\nLong Melford survived the Black Death in 1348-9, and was a brief stop-off in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\nBy the early 15th century, the manor of [[Kentwell]] belonged to the Clopton family. John Clopton was arrested in 1461 and charged with [[treason]]. Clopton was spared execution and he was released and returned to Kentwell.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There he organised and largely helped to pay for the rebuilding of the parish church, a notable example of a [[wool church]]. During this time the wealth of the parish was increasing, with most of the inhabitants being [[free tenant|free men]], renting their homes and lands.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Guild]]s were founded, and weaving cloth became a key part of the village's economy. In the official inspector's returns for the year 1446, there were as many as 30 named weavers in Long Melford, who between them produced 264 finished \"cloths\".\n\nFollowing the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] granted the manor to [[William Cordell|Sir William Cordell]].<ref name=Kelly2 />\n\n=== Modern era ===\nIn 1604, an epidemic of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] arrived in Melford and 119 people died between the months of May and September. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} During the [[English Civil War]], a Puritan mob of over one thousand arrived in Melford pursuing [[Elizabeth Savage, Countess Rivers]], a staunch [[Catholic]] and [[Cavalier|Royalist]], from her property in [[St Osyth]] to her Suffolk estate at Melford Hall.

By 1851, there were three horsehair manufacturers in Melford employing over 200 men, women and children. Prince Bertie, who later became King Edward VII, together with Princess Alexandra visited the village in November 1865, and large archways were constructed at key points in their honour to welcome them in, with the crowds.\nDuring the 1880s, a series of wage cuts in the coconut industry caused widespread anger and eventually resulted in strike action. Feelings ran high, culminating in a riot breaking out on polling day in December 1885, during which considerable damage was caused throughout the village. Troops were summoned from Bury St Edmunds to restore order; they arrived by train and marched from Melford station to read the [[Riot Act]] from the steps of the Police Station.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn World War I, hundreds of village men volunteered to serve their country. They joined many diverse army regiments, such as the Scots Guards, Prince of Wales Regiment, Royal Engineers, the Suffolk Regiment, serving in Gallipoli, Ypres, the Somme and numerous military campaigns. Other men fought in the Royal Navy, and the newly formed Royal Flying Corps. In October 1920, the village war memorial was unveiled, and is located at the entrance of the Holy Trinity Church.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Long Melford was a location for American and Allied service personnel, who flew [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B24]] and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B17]] aircraft from two large bomber stations, [[RAF Lavenham]] and [[RAF Sudbury]], located nearby.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Troops from, amongst others, the [[Berkshire Regiment|Berkshire]] and [[Black Watch Regiment]]s, were billeted and garrisoned within the village.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Injured airmen, troops from the [[D-Day landings]] and [[prisoners of war]] were treated at the large nearby 136th Station Hospital, located between Long Melford and [[Acton, Suffolk|Acton]].

It is connected to several large towns by bus, notably Sudbury, Colchester, [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]] and [[Ipswich]].\n\n== Sport and leisure ==\n\nLong Melford has a [[Non-League football]] club, [[Long Melford F.C.]], which plays at Stoneylands, just off St Catherine's Road. They are members of the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]] Premier Division following promotion as champions of Division One in the 2014/15 season.\n\nLong Melford has a large water meadow on the approach to [[Liston, Essex|Liston]] and a network of footpaths. Among these paths is the Melford Walk, which follows the route of the [[Long Melford-Bury St Edmunds branch line|disused railway line]] before joining the Valley Walk path to Sudbury. The Suffolk Cycle Route also passes through the village. Located at the southern end of the village next to the River Stour in the adjoining hamlet of [[Rodbridge Corner]] is Long Melford Country Park. This was formed by gravel excavations for nearby airfields during the second world war, leaving some large, attractive lakes with wildlife habitats and walking areas for visitors.\n\nThe Long Melford Street Fair, Classic Steam Rally and the Big Night Out [[Guy Fawkes Night]] fireworks event at Melford Hall are held annually.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nLong Melford was visited by [[Daniel Defoe]], who mentioned the village in his book ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]''. Defoe wrote, \"Near adjoining to it &#91;[[Sudbury, Suffolk|Sudbury]]&#93; is a village call'd Long-Melfort, and a very long one it is, from which I suppose it had that addition to its name; it is full of very good houses, and, as they told me, is richer, and has more wealthy masters of the manufacture in it, than in Sudbury itself.\"<ref>''Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain'' was published in 3 vols. in 1724\u201326; Defoe's travels were made at various times before 1723.

The album was long thought to be a studio release, however, it is a late [[Starday Records]] compilation of Jones recordings throughout the mid to late-1950s.\n\nThe album features many of Jones' early gems, including many of his earliest hits, \"[[You Gotta Be My Baby]]\" from 1956, \"[[Seasons of My Heart]]\" from 1955, and Jones' first chart single \"[[Why Baby Why]]\" in 1955. It even lists a track from his third collaboration attempt in 1957 with Virginia Spurlock titled: \"No, No, Never.\"\n\n==Background and composition==\nIn late 1956, there were shakeups in some of the top management jobs in [[Nashville]] and part of this realignment saw Starday Records<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsnpubs.com/starday/stardaystory.html|title=The Starday Story|website=www.bsnpubs.com|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>, an independent country music label founded in [[Houston]] by Jones's producer and mentor H.W. \"Pappy\" Daily<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glad-music-publishing-and-recording.myshopify.com/pages/the-pappy-daily-story|title=The Pappy Daily Story|website=Glad Music Company|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> and Jack Starnes, absorbed into [[Mercury Records]].  As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to the Jones retrospective ''Cup of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years'', Daily and Starday president Don Pierce were approached to take over Mercury's country roster to form the Mercury-Starday label but \"the clincher was the success of George Jones.  After 12 years in the business, Mercury hadn't found one country artist who had promised or delivered half of what George had.\"  By July 1958, Mercury-Starday dissolved with Pierce assuming control of Starday and Jones remaining at Mercury with Daily producing him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Starday Story: The House That Country Music Built|last=Gibson|first=Nathan|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2011|isbn=1617037400|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nJones wrote or co-wrote all of the selections on ''Long Live King George''.  Two selections, \"Nothing Can Stop My Love\" and \"Tall, Tall Trees\", were co-written with Jones's friend [[Roger Miller]], the latter becoming a chart-topping country hit for [[Alan Jackson]] in 1995.  Jones also collaborated with [[J.P. Richardson]] (better known as [[the Big Bopper]]) on the upbeat \"If I Don't Love You (Grits Ain't Groceries)\" (Richardson would also compose \"[[White Lightnin']]\", which would become Jones's first number one in 1959).\n\n''Long Live King George'' includes several songs, such as his first chart hit \"[[Why Baby Why]]\", that appeared on his 1957 debut album ''Grand Ole Opry's New Star''.   As Jones star continued to rise in the country music field, Starday would continue to release albums featuring recordings by Jones culled from its archive, including several [[rockabilly]] sides that the singer detested.  Starday would continue this practice into the 1970s.  Jones would later explain to Nick Tosches in 1994, \"There was no such thing as production at Starday.

The album was long thought to be a studio release, however, it is a late [[Starday Records]] compilation of Jones recordings throughout the mid to late-1950s.\n\nThe album features many of Jones' early gems, including many of his earliest hits, \"[[You Gotta Be My Baby]]\" from 1956, \"[[Seasons of My Heart]]\" from 1955, and Jones' first chart single \"[[Why Baby Why]]\" in 1955. It even lists a track from his third collaboration attempt in 1957 with Virginia Spurlock titled: \"No, No, Never.\"\n\n==Background and composition==\nIn late 1956, there were shakeups in some of the top management jobs in [[Nashville]] and part of this realignment saw Starday Records<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsnpubs.com/starday/stardaystory.html|title=The Starday Story|website=www.bsnpubs.com|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>, an independent country music label founded in [[Houston]] by Jones's producer and mentor H.W. \"Pappy\" Daily<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://glad-music-publishing-and-recording.myshopify.com/pages/the-pappy-daily-story|title=The Pappy Daily Story|website=Glad Music Company|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> and Jack Starnes, absorbed into [[Mercury Records]].  As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to the Jones retrospective ''Cup of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years'', Daily and Starday president Don Pierce were approached to take over Mercury's country roster to form the Mercury-Starday label but \"the clincher was the success of George Jones.  After 12 years in the business, Mercury hadn't found one country artist who had promised or delivered half of what George had.\"  By July 1958, Mercury-Starday dissolved with Pierce assuming control of Starday and Jones remaining at Mercury with Daily producing him<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Starday Story: The House That Country Music Built|last=Gibson|first=Nathan|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2011|isbn=1617037400|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\n\nJones wrote or co-wrote all of the selections on ''Long Live King George''.  Two selections, \"Nothing Can Stop My Love\" and \"Tall, Tall Trees\", were co-written with Jones's friend [[Roger Miller]], the latter becoming a chart-topping country hit for [[Alan Jackson]] in 1995.  Jones also collaborated with [[J.P. Richardson]] (better known as [[the Big Bopper]]) on the upbeat \"If I Don't Love You (Grits Ain't Groceries)\" (Richardson would also compose \"[[White Lightnin']]\", which would become Jones's first number one in 1959).\n\n''Long Live King George'' includes several songs, such as his first chart hit \"[[Why Baby Why]]\", that appeared on his 1957 debut album ''Grand Ole Opry's New Star''.   As Jones star continued to rise in the country music field, Starday would continue to release albums featuring recordings by Jones culled from its archive, including several [[rockabilly]] sides that the singer detested.  Starday would continue this practice into the 1970s.  Jones would later explain to Nick Tosches in 1994, \"There was no such thing as production at Starday.  We\u2019d go in with the band, we\u2019d go over the song, I\u2019d look over and tell the steel player to take a break or kick it off, and I\u2019d get the fiddle to play a turnaround in the middle.

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965. The two [[The Nigel Barton Plays|Nigel Barton plays]] (8<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/810533/index.html \"Stand Up, Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and 15 December 1965)<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1041034/ \"Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> first brought him to widespread public attention and the slightly earlier ''Alice'' (13 October 1965),<ref>John R. Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>.

The plays were usually written for television, although adaptations from other sources also featured. The series gained a reputation for presenting contemporary social dramas, and for bringing issues to the attention of a mass audience that would not otherwise have been discussed on screen.\n\nSome of British television drama's most influential, and controversial, plays were shown in this slot, including ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''. The earliest television plays of [[Dennis Potter]] were featured in this slot.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and early seasons===\nThe series was suggested to the BBC's Head of Drama, [[Sydney Newman]], by the corporation's director of television [[Kenneth Adam]] after his cancellation of the two previous series of single plays.<ref name=\"Wake\">Oliver Wake [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/ \"Wednesday Play, The (1964-70)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> Newman had been persuaded to join the BBC following the success of the similar programme ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', which he had produced while Head of Drama at [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] from 1958 to 1962. ''Armchair Theatre'' had tackled many difficult and socially relevant subjects in the then-popular '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' style, and still managed to gain a mass audience on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, and Newman wanted a programme that would be able to tackle similar issues with a broad appeal. Newman also wanted to get away from the BBC's reputation of producing safe and unchallenging drama programmes, to produce something with more bite and vigour, what Newman called \"agitational contemporaneity\".<ref name=\"Wake\"/>\n\n''The Wednesday Play'' succeeded in meeting this aim, and the BBC quickly developed the practice of stockpiling six or seven ''Wednesday Plays'' in case there were problems with individual works.<ref>Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh [https://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA149 \"The BBC and the Birth of the Wednesday Play 1962-66\"] in Janet Thumim ''Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000, p.149-64, 159</ref> One production, ''[[The War Game]]'' (1965), was withdrawn from broadcast by a nervous BBC under pressure from the government, while [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]' ''[[Fable (TV play)|Fable]]'' (20 January 1965),<ref name=\"Duguid\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/476259/ \"Fable (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> an inversion of South Africa's [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] system, was delayed for several weeks over fears that it would incite racial tensions.<ref name=\"Duguid\"/>\n\nIntended as a vehicle for new writers, several careers began thanks to the series. Television programmes had a much shorter [[lead time]] in this era, and [[Dennis Potter]]'s first four accepted television plays were shown during the course of 1965.

Cook ''Dennis Potter: a life on screen'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, p.333, n.3:5</ref> about [[Lewis Carroll]]'s relationship with [[Alice Liddell]], developed themes to which Potter would return.\n\nIn the first half of 1966 a series of 26 ''Wednesday Plays'' were produced by [[Peter Luke]], the playwright, and story edited by [[David Benedictus]]. Highlights included ''The Snowball'' (20 April 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\">Irene Shubik ''Play for Today: the evolution of television drama'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000 [1975], p.46</ref> adapted from the novel by [[Brigid Brophy]], ''Toddler on the Run'' adapted by [[Shena Mackay]] from her novella and directed by [[James MacTaggart]], (25 May 1966),<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> ''Cock Hen and Courting Pit'' (renamed ''A Tour of the Old Floorboards'', 22 June 1966)<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> by [[David Halliwell]] and two plays by [[Frank O'Connor]] (which [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted)<ref name=\"MMK&SL\">Madeleine MacMurragh-Kavanagh and Stephen Lacey \"Who Framed Theatre?: The 'Moment of Change' in British TV Drama\" in ''New Theatre Quarterly'', No.57, February 1999, p.69</ref> virtually without dialogue<ref name=\"MMK&SL\"/> and which, renamed ''Silent Song'', won The [[Prix Italia]] award<ref>Adam Benedick and Sydney Newman [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-luke--obituaries-1569776.html Obituary: Peter Luke,] ''The Independent'', 26 January 1995</ref> in 1967 for 'original dramatic programmes' jointly with a French programme.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf \"Winners 1949-2010\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022124024/http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2010/pdf/WINNERS_1949-2010.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, Prix Italia official website</ref> The other O'Connor/Leonard work was ''The Retreat'' (11 May 1966).<ref name=\"Shubik1\"/> These two plays starred [[Milo O'Shea]] and [[Jack McGowran]]. ''Cathy Come Home'' by [[Nell Dunn]] and [[Jeremy Sandford]] was offered to the Luke/Benedictus team who passed it on to [[Tony Garnett]].\n\n===Tony Garnett and Ken Loach===\nGarnett was quickly seen as someone capable of delivering plays which would gain much publicity for the BBC and its Drama department.<ref name=\"Lacey1\">Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.56</ref> He had the enthusiastic support of Newman, his immediate superior, who lobbied for increased funding to allow for more location shooting on film rather than shooting productions in the multi-camera electronic television studio, a practice which was felt to impair realism, the preferred mode.<ref name=\"Lacey1\"/>\n\nDirector [[Ken Loach]] made ten plays in all for ''The Wednesday Play'' series.<ref>Jacob Leigh ''The Cinema of Ken Loach: Art in the Service of the People'', London: Wallflower Press, 2002, p.195</ref> Two of them are among the best remembered of the entire run: an adaptation of [[Nell Dunn]]'s ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (3 November 1965),<ref>Ros Cranston [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/440997/ \"Up the Junction (1965)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and the saga of a homeless young couple and their battle to prevent their children being taken into local authority care: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (16 November 1966).<ref>Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438481/ \"Cathy Come Home (1966)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> The latter began Loach's 13 year collaboration with Tony Garnett as his producer, although Garnett had been closely involved with ''Up the Junction'' as well.<ref>Jason Deans and Maggie Brown [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death \"Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death\"], ''The Guardian'', 28 April 2013</ref>\n\nPlays like ''Up the Junction'' though were controversial among more conservative viewers. The 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] accused the BBC of portraying \"promiscuity as normal\" in ''Up the Junction''<ref name=\"Hayward\">Anthony Hayward [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/cathy-come-home-422630.html \"Cathy come home\",] ''The Independent'', 3 November 2006</ref> and ''The Wednesday Play'' as featuring \"Dirt, Doubt and Disbelief\".<ref>Asa Briggs ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Volume 5'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.519</ref> The writer on  television [[Anthony Hayward]] quoted Garnett in 2006: \"Mary Whitehouse was on the prowl, which was an added frisson, but it was actually very good free publicity and helped the ratings.\"<ref name=\"Hayward\"/> The 'drama documentary' approach was criticised by television professionals who thought it was dishonest. In a ''[[The Sunday Telegraph|Sunday Telegraph]]'' article published before its first repeat transmission [[Grace Wyndham Goldie]] complained that ''Cathy Come Home'' \"deliberately blurs the distinction between fact and fiction ... [viewers] have a right to know whether what they are being offered is real or invented.\"<ref name=\"Lacey2\">Quoted by Stephen Lacey ''Tony Garnett'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002, p.57</ref> Loach has admitted that \"[w]e were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news\" which preceded ''The Wednesday Play''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slot.<ref>Graham Fuller ''Loach on Loach'', London: Faber, 1998, p.15 cited in Samantha Lay ''British Social Realism: From Documentary to Brit-Grit'', London: WEallflower Press, 2002, p.21</ref>\n\n===Later seasons===\nThe last three years of the strand were predominantly produced by [[Irene Shubik]] and [[Graeme MacDonald]]; by this time the BBC Drama head Sydney Newman had left the BBC. Highlights from this period include several plays by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]] such as ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1 March 1967)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557285/ \"''In Two Minds'' (1967)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (10 April 1968)<ref>Janet Moat [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/539459/ \"''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> and Potter's ''[[Son of Man (play)|Son of Man]]'' (16 April 1969),<ref>Sergio Angelini [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1056162/ \"''Son of Man'' (1969)\"], BFI screenonline</ref> a modern interpretation of the story of [[Jesus]].\n\nSuffering from declining audience figures, the run of ''The Wednesday Play'' ended in 1970 when the day of transmission changed, and the series morphed into ''[[Play for Today]]''.\n\n==Reputation and availability==\nIt is regarded as one of the most influential and successful programmes to be produced in Britain during the 1960s, and is still frequently referenced and discussed. In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the [[British Film Institute]] to find the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, two ''Wednesday Plays'' made the list: ''The War Game'' was placed twenty-seventh, and ''Cathy Come Home'' was voted the second greatest British television programme of the century.\n\nSome examples of ''The Wednesday Play'', such as ''[[The War Game]]'' (which was not screened by the BBC for 20 years) and ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966), a television play exploring the theme of housing and homelessness, was according to filmmaker [[Roger Graef]] \"a giant wakeup call for the whole nation,\"<ref>Roger Graef [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/feb/15/homelessness.communities \"Out of the box\"], ''The Guardian'', 15 February 2006</ref> and some of the Potter plays, surfaced on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]; the Potter play, ''Alice'' was a bonus feature of a Region 1 DVD in 2010 of [[Jonathan Miller]]'s surrealist version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. The Ken Loach material has resurfaced in a ''Ken Loach at the BBC'' set. However, as with much British television of this era, many episodes are [[Wiping (magnetic tape)|lost]], leaving 76 surviving in the Archives<!-- Not necessarily the BBCs. --> (along with 3 with some surviving sequences) out of 170 transmitted.<ref>[http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?programme=af856159-e83f-4614-89e2-7e69b050cf42 ''Missing or incomplete episodes for programme ''The Wednesday Play''\"], lostshows.com</ref>\n\n==Productions==\nThis table is based on records in the BBC Genome archive of the Radio Times<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>. Titles that carried the tag 'The Wednesday Play' (or 'The Wednesday Play presenting') on the BBC listings for their first or subsequent transmission are included, along with some repeats where the initial broadcast was not branded 'The Wednesday Play', but the repeat was. Repeats of the individual productions are excluded. All episodes were broadcast on BBC1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Original Air Date\n! Title\n! Author(s)\n!

The Royal Free Hospital was the first teaching hospital in London to admit women for training.\n\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson was Dean (1883\u20131903) while the school was rebuilt, became part of the [[University of London]] and consolidated association with the Royal Free Hospital.  In 1896, the School was officially renamed the '''London (Royal Free Hospital) School of Medicine for Women'''.\n\nIn 1894, a well known [[India]]n feminist Dr. [[Rukhmabai]] qualified in medicine after attending the London School of Medicine for Women.  The number of Indian women students steadily increased so that by 1920 the school, in co-operation with the [[India Office]] opened a hostel for female Indian medical students.\n\nIn 1914, the school was further expanded due to the number of women wishing to study medicine, making it necessary to increase the number of laboratories and lecture rooms by double. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the time of expansion, the school had over 300 students enrolled, making it the largest women university colleges in Britain. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1998, it merged with the [[University College Hospital]]'s medical school to form the [[UCL Medical School]].<ref name=\"ucl\" />\n\n== Background about the founders ==\n\n=== Elizabeth Blackwell ===\nElizabeth Blackwell was the first woman from the United States of America to receive a medical degree.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/elizabeth-blackwell|title=Elizabeth Blackwell|website=National Women's History Museum|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> Born in Bristol, England on the 3rd of February 1821, Elizabeth Blackwell was the third of nine children in the family. Among the many family members, Blackwell had famous relatives, including her brother Henry, a well-known abolitionist and women's rights supporter. \n\nIn 1832, Blackwell moved to America, specifically settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1838, Blackwell's father, Samuel Blackwell, died, leaving the family in poor economic status during a national economic crisis. Because of this, Blackwell received her first occupational job as a teacher along with her mother and her sisters. Blackwell's inspiration for medicine sparked during a conversation with her dying friend, stating her situation would have been better if she had been a female physician. While teaching, Blackwell boarded two male physicians from the south, allowing her to attain her first real knowledge of the medical field through the mentoring from the two physicians.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nIn 1847, Blackwell applied to college, getting rejected from everywhere she applied, except from Geneva College who accepted her as a practical joke.<ref name=\":1\" /> After receiving years of discrimination, Blackwell eventually graduated first in her class, slowly earning the respect of her professors and educators. Blackwell then returned to New York City, opening a small clinic with the help of her Quaker friends. There she provided positions for women physicians during the Civil War, training women nurses for the union hospitals. \n\nIn 1875, she left New York City to become a professor of Gynecology at the newly built London School of Medicine for Women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Sophia Jex-Blake ===\nSophia Jex-Blake was born in Hastings, UK in 1840.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/equality-diversity/celebrating-diversity/inspiring-women/women-in-history/sophia-jex-blake|title=Sophia Jex-Blake|website=The University of Edinburgh|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> After attending various private schools, Jex-Blake attended Queen's College. Jex-Blake's pursuit of an occupation in the field of medicine lead to the desire to enroll in the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. Jex-Blake's desire to attend the University of Edinburgh was hindered because the university did not allow women to attend. To fight this, Jex-Blake opened a court case against the university, resulting in an unsuccessful ruling in favor of the University of Edinburgh. \n\nIn 1889, the Act of Parliament ruled for degrees for women, largely resulting because of Jex-Blake's struggles. This allowed Sophia Jex-Blake to become one of the first female doctors in the UK. Jex-Blake then founded the London School of Medicine for Women as well as the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Elizabeth Garrett Anderson ===\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson was born in Whitechapel, London and received a good education. She chose to pursue a medical career after meeting Doctor [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]. After applying to several medical schools, Anderson got rejected from all of those she applied to. Thus, Anderson enrolled as a nurse in Middlesex Hospital and was appointed to the position of medical attendant in 1866 at St. Mary's Dispensary. Still wishing to become a doctor, Anderson successfully pursued a medical degree in France.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/elizabethgarrettanderson|title=Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1836-1917)|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>   \n\nReturning to London, Anderson assisted in the founding of the  New Hospital for Women at the St. Mary's Dispensary and the London School of Medicine for Women. Anderson would later oversee the London School's expansion after she receiving the position of Dean in 1833, after which she also appointed Blackwell as a Professor of Gynecology.

The Royal Free Hospital was the first teaching hospital in London to admit women for training.\n\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson was Dean (1883\u20131903) while the school was rebuilt, became part of the [[University of London]] and consolidated association with the Royal Free Hospital.  In 1896, the School was officially renamed the '''London (Royal Free Hospital) School of Medicine for Women'''.\n\nIn 1894, a well known [[India]]n feminist Dr. [[Rukhmabai]] qualified in medicine after attending the London School of Medicine for Women.  The number of Indian women students steadily increased so that by 1920 the school, in co-operation with the [[India Office]] opened a hostel for female Indian medical students.\n\nIn 1914, the school was further expanded due to the number of women wishing to study medicine, making it necessary to increase the number of laboratories and lecture rooms by double. <ref name=\":0\" /> At the time of expansion, the school had over 300 students enrolled, making it the largest women university colleges in Britain. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1998, it merged with the [[University College Hospital]]'s medical school to form the [[UCL Medical School]].<ref name=\"ucl\" />\n\n== Background about the founders ==\n\n=== Elizabeth Blackwell ===\nElizabeth Blackwell was the first woman from the United States of America to receive a medical degree.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/elizabeth-blackwell|title=Elizabeth Blackwell|website=National Women's History Museum|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> Born in Bristol, England on the 3rd of February 1821, Elizabeth Blackwell was the third of nine children in the family. Among the many family members, Blackwell had famous relatives, including her brother Henry, a well-known abolitionist and women's rights supporter. \n\nIn 1832, Blackwell moved to America, specifically settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1838, Blackwell's father, Samuel Blackwell, died, leaving the family in poor economic status during a national economic crisis. Because of this, Blackwell received her first occupational job as a teacher along with her mother and her sisters. Blackwell's inspiration for medicine sparked during a conversation with her dying friend, stating her situation would have been better if she had been a female physician. While teaching, Blackwell boarded two male physicians from the south, allowing her to attain her first real knowledge of the medical field through the mentoring from the two physicians.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nIn 1847, Blackwell applied to college, getting rejected from everywhere she applied, except from Geneva College who accepted her as a practical joke.<ref name=\":1\" /> After receiving years of discrimination, Blackwell eventually graduated first in her class, slowly earning the respect of her professors and educators. Blackwell then returned to New York City, opening a small clinic with the help of her Quaker friends. There she provided positions for women physicians during the Civil War, training women nurses for the union hospitals. \n\nIn 1875, she left New York City to become a professor of Gynecology at the newly built London School of Medicine for Women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Sophia Jex-Blake ===\nSophia Jex-Blake was born in Hastings, UK in 1840.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/equality-diversity/celebrating-diversity/inspiring-women/women-in-history/sophia-jex-blake|title=Sophia Jex-Blake|website=The University of Edinburgh|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> After attending various private schools, Jex-Blake attended Queen's College. Jex-Blake's pursuit of an occupation in the field of medicine lead to the desire to enroll in the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. Jex-Blake's desire to attend the University of Edinburgh was hindered because the university did not allow women to attend. To fight this, Jex-Blake opened a court case against the university, resulting in an unsuccessful ruling in favor of the University of Edinburgh. \n\nIn 1889, the Act of Parliament ruled for degrees for women, largely resulting because of Jex-Blake's struggles. This allowed Sophia Jex-Blake to become one of the first female doctors in the UK. Jex-Blake then founded the London School of Medicine for Women as well as the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Elizabeth Garrett Anderson ===\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson was born in Whitechapel, London and received a good education. She chose to pursue a medical career after meeting Doctor [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]. After applying to several medical schools, Anderson got rejected from all of those she applied to. Thus, Anderson enrolled as a nurse in Middlesex Hospital and was appointed to the position of medical attendant in 1866 at St. Mary's Dispensary. Still wishing to become a doctor, Anderson successfully pursued a medical degree in France.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/elizabethgarrettanderson|title=Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1836-1917)|website=broughttolife.sciencemuseum.org.uk|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>   \n\nReturning to London, Anderson assisted in the founding of the  New Hospital for Women at the St. Mary's Dispensary and the London School of Medicine for Women.

On 7 February 1987, the main route was cut back to run between [[Putney Heath]] ''Green Man'' and [[Euston railway station|Euston]] (or [[Tottenham Court Road tube station|Tottenham Court Road station]] Monday to Saturday evenings). The Sunday services consisted of a morning extension to Hornsey Rise, and a further extension to [[Turnpike Lane tube station|Turnpike Lane station]], via [[Crouch End]], on Sunday afternoons, with meal relief journeys running to Wood Green Garage.

He attended the [[Novo Mesto Grammar School]]. In 1967, he enrolled in the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he studied history and geography, and later also economy. During his student years, he started collaborating with the [[Christian left]] intellectual circle around the journal ''[[Revija 2000]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, Peterle started working at the Institute for Urban planning of the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]]. In the mid-1980s, he was involved in several projects of trans-regional cooperation within the [[Alpe-Adria]] regional cooperation network.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Leader of the Christian Democrats, 1990\u20132000===\n\nIn 1990, he was elected president of the newly founded [[Slovene Christian Democrats]].\n\nPeterle became [[prime minister]] of Slovenia in May 1990 after parliamentary elections of April 1990 won by the [[DEMOS coalition]] (which included Christian Democrats and was created in the opposition to the [[Communist]] rule). In 1991, the DEMOS-led Slovene Parliament declared the country's independence from Yugoslavia, in compliance with the result of a [[referendum]] held in December the previous year. He served as prime minister until May 1992, when due to an internal crisis in the [[DEMOS coalition]], a new coalition government under [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]] was established by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. In the elections of 1992, the Christian Democrats gained some support and became the second largest party in a highly fragmented [[National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia|National Assembly]], after the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]]. The Christian Democrats entered a cross-party coalition with the Liberal Democrats and the [[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|United List of Social Democrats]] (former [[Communist Party of Slovenia]]) under the leadership of [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]].\n\nPeterle served as deputy prime minister and [[foreign minister]] from January 1993 until October 1994. Tensions were deep in the coalition, however, and Peterle resigned from his posts in 1994 when Drnov\u0161ek nominated [[Jo\u017eef \u0160kol\u010d]], a member of his own [[Liberal Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Liberal Democratic Party]], to be speaker of Parliament, against the wishes of Peterle who believed that a Christian Democrat should be the speaker. The Christian Democrats did remain in the coalition, which was often divided over specific policy issues. In 1996, Peterle called for the dismissal of foreign minister [[Zoran Thaler]] because of his belief that Thaler did not do enough to help Slovenia's relations with [[Italy]].\n\nIn the [[1996 Slovenian parliamentary election|1996 elections]], Peterle's party suffered a decisive defeat, losing popular support to the other two centre-right parties, the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]] and the [[Slovene People's Party]], that had remained in the opposition and had criticised what they called a \"unprincipled coalition between Christian Democracy and former Communists\".\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, the Christian Democrats remained in opposition, and Peterle's leadership was frequently challenged by different fractions within the party. He nevertheless managed to remain the chairman of the Party until 2000, when the Christian Democrats merged with the [[Slovenian People's Party]], which had until then supported [[Janez Drnov\u0161ek]]'s third term as Prime Minister. As a consequence, Drnov\u0161ek's government fell in 2000, and Peterle became foreign minister again in the short-lived centre-right government of [[Andrej Bajuk]] from June 2000 to November 2000.\n\n===After the elections of 2000===\nDue to a disagreement over the election legislation, Peterle left the [[Slovene People's Party]] shortly after its unification with the Christian Democrats and joined the newly founded [[New Slovenia|New Slovenia \u2013 Christian People's Party]]. In the elections of 2000, both of Slovenia's conservative and [[christian democratic]] parties suffered a defeat against Drnov\u0161ek's [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]], while the [[Slovenian Democratic Party|Slovenian Social Democratic Party]] assumed the undisputed leadership of the centre-right opposition.\n\n===Member of the European Parliament, 2004-2019===\nIn 2002, Peterle became the 13th member of the steering committee of the  [[Convention on the Future of Europe]], which drafted the ''[[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]''.<ref>Martin Banks (April 17, 2002), [http://www.politico.eu/article/slovenian-wins-last-seat-on-praesidium/ Slovenian wins last seat on praesidium] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>\n\nIn the [[2004 European Parliament election in Slovenia|2004 elections]] to the [[European Parliament]], Peterle was elected for [[New Slovenia]], as a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).

He was also a member of the [[Subcommittee on Human Rights]] from 2004 until 2009.\n\nIn addition to his committee assignments, Peterle has been chairing the parliament's delegation to the EU-former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee since 2014.
