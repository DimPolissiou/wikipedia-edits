He dominated the [[Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry]], as well as the subsequent [[Walpole ministry]], and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest-serving British prime minister in history]]. [[William Arthur Speck|W. A. Speck]] wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history...&nbsp;Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".<ref>W. A. Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) p. 203</ref>\n\nWalpole was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the [[gentry]] class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a [[Squire#England|country squire]] and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688\u20131832'' (1997), p. 71</ref> Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps, <ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p. 410</ref> but his appointment to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock-market crisis drew attention to a perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[H. T. Dickinson]] sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)....He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament\".<ref>[[H. T. Dickinson]], \"Walpole, Sir Robert\", in David Loads, editor, ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) p. 1338</ref>   Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers. <ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Strangio|author2=Paul 't Hart|author3=James Walter|title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA225|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=225|isbn=9780199666423}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], [[Norfolk]] in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650\u20131700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]].  [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Education and early business success==\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered \"an excellent scholar\". He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day.{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the [[Walpole family|Walpole estate]]. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nAs a young man, Walpole had bought [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the [[South Sea Company]], which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create [[Houghton Hall]] as seen today.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glentzer|first1=Molly|title='Houghton Hall' peeks at a real 'Downton Abbey'|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Houghton-Hall-peeks-at-a-real-Downton-Abbey-5568249.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date= 20 June 2014|accessdate=5 March 2016|quote=As a young man, Sir Robert bought shares of the South Seas Co., which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. \"But Walpole bought at the bottom and sold at the top,\" Tinterow said. That fortune enabled him to build Houghton.}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181\u201382}}\n\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.  He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.<ref>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) pp 206\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}\n\n==Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry==\n{{Main|First Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry|Second Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry}}\nQueen Anne died in 1714. Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by her [[second cousin]], the [[Elector of Hanover]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] and rose to the position of [[Paymaster of the Forces]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}} in a Cabinet nominally led by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], but actually dominated by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law) and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]. Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cihm_20078 archive.org: \"A Report from the Committee of Secrecy, appointed by order of the House of Commons: to examine several books and papers laid before the House, relating to the late negociations of peace and commerce, &c. : reported on the ninth of June, 1715\"] by Robert Walpole, Chairman</ref> [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] was impeached, and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]] suffered from an [[Bill of attainder|act of attainder]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}}\n\nLord Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715 and by 1716 Walpole was appointed to the posts of [[First Lord of the Treasury|First Commissioner (Lord) of the Treasury]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He was a  member of the ''Board of General Officers'' established in 1717 to investigate the abuse of pay.

Normally, Walpole and Lord Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] on the other. Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart. The Stanhope\u2013Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support. In 1716 Townshend had been removed from the important post of [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]] and put in the lesser office of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} Even this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition \"because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on\",<ref>{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=185}} cites ''Parl.

He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Grant Robertson|title=England under the Hanoverians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG7Nls67aQC&pg=PA66|year=1921|page=66}}</ref> By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes.  He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates.  He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732.  His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers.  Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on him.  By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.W. Ward et al. eds. |title=The Cambridge Modern History: Volume VI: the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMgFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA46|year=1909|page=46}}</ref>  The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.<ref>Paul Langford, ''A polite and commercial people: England, 1727-1783'' (1998). pp 28-33</ref>\n\nAfter the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before.

His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] who was estranged from his father, the King. Several young politicians including [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] and [[George Grenville]] formed a faction known as the \"[[Patriot Whigs|Patriot Boys]]\" and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition.<ref>{{Citation|first=Keith |last=Laybourn |year=2001 |title=British Political Leaders: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IolLcc5htJoC&pg=PA319 319]\u201320}}</ref>\n\nWalpole's failure to maintain a policy of avoiding military conflict eventually led to his fall from power.<ref>{{Citation |first=J.H. |last=Plumb |year=1960 |title=Sir Robert Walpole; the Making of a Statesman: The King's Minister|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brYNAQAAMAAJ |publisher=Cresset Press |page={{page needed|date=March 2014}} }}</ref> Under the [[Treaty of Seville (1729)|Treaty of Seville]] (1729), Great Britain agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies in North America.

In the [[1741 British general election|1741 general election]] his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many [[rotten borough|pocket boroughs]] (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons). In general the government made gains in England and [[Wales]] but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the [[1734 British general election|1734 election]] and further losses in [[Cornwall]] where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also [[Duke of Cornwall]]). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.<ref>{{Citation |last=Speck|first=W.

Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it had formerly been, his detractors\u2014such as William Pulteney, earl of Bath, and Lord Perceval\u2014being approximately as numerous as his supporters. Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office. Parliamentary committees were formed to investigate these charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/robert-walpole|title=History of Sir Robert Walpole - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of a by-election in [[Chippenham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chippenham]], Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a [[motion of no confidence]].

His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the king's favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.<ref>Jonathan Oates, \"Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745.\" ''History 91.302'' (2006): 218-230.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nLord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] in an administration whose true head was [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]].

Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of [[Henry Pelham]] whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation. Frederick, Prince of Wales, usually hostile to Walpole, warmly received him at his court the next day, most likely because his father's throne, and the future of the whole Hanoverian dynasty, was at risk from the Stuart Pretender.<ref name=\"npg.org.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw04757/Robert-Walpole-1st-Earl-of-Orford|title=Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford - National Portrait Gallery|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlong with his political interests in his last years, Walpole enjoyed the pleasures of the hunt.

The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nWalpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Dynasty]], and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, with the defeat of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|rebellion of 1745]].

He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.<ref>{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62\u201363}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both\".{{sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114}} Chesterfield claimed he was \"much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life\":\n\n{{quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a Man in his Station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain Elevation of mind...He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived...Money, not Prerogative, was the chief Engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity...When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ... His Name will not be recorded in History among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.{{sfn|Franklin|1993|pp=114\u2013115}} }}\n\n[[10 Downing Street]] represents another part of Walpole's legacy. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\"/>\n\nWalpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers.

\"KG, KB\": he resigned the Bath on appointment to the Garter in 1726--> (26 August 1676 \u2013 18 March 1745), known between 1721 and 1742 as '''Sir Robert Walpole''', was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] politician who is generally regarded as the ''[[de facto]]'' first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]].\n\nAlthough the exact dates of Walpole's dominance, dubbed the \"Robinocracy\",<ref>{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|Robinocracy}}</ref> are a matter of scholarly debate, the period 1721\u20131742 is often used. He dominated the [[Walpole\u2013Townshend ministry]], as well as the subsequent [[Walpole ministry]], and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest-serving British prime minister in history]]. [[William Arthur Speck|W. A. Speck]] wrote that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister \"is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history...&nbsp;Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons\".<ref>W. A. Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) p. 203</ref>\n\nWalpole was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the [[gentry]] class who was first elected to Parliament in 1701 and held many senior positions. He was a [[Squire#England|country squire]] and looked to country gentlemen for his political base. Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his \"reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence\".<ref>Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688\u20131832'' (1997), p. 71</ref> Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes and growing exports and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters. He mostly avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps, <ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p. 410</ref> but his appointment to [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] stock-market crisis drew attention to a perceived protection of political allies by Walpole.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[H. T. Dickinson]] sums up his historical role by saying that \"Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history. He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)....He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament\".<ref>[[H. T. Dickinson]], \"Walpole, Sir Robert\", in David Loads, editor, ''Reader's Guide to British History'' (2003) p. 1338</ref>   Scholars rank him highly among all British prime ministers. <ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul Strangio|author2=Paul 't Hart|author3=James Walter|title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA225|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=225|isbn=9780199666423}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWalpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], [[Norfolk]] in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650\u20131700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]].  [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Education and early business success==\nAs a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered \"an excellent scholar\". He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day.{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698, he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Robert succeeded to inherit the [[Walpole family|Walpole estate]]. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nAs a young man, Walpole had bought [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the [[South Sea Company]], which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. However, Walpole had bought at the bottom and sold at the top, adding greatly to his inherited wealth and allowing him to create [[Houghton Hall]] as seen today.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Glentzer|first1=Molly|title='Houghton Hall' peeks at a real 'Downton Abbey'|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Houghton-Hall-peeks-at-a-real-Downton-Abbey-5568249.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date= 20 June 2014|accessdate=5 March 2016|quote=As a young man, Sir Robert bought shares of the South Seas Co., which monopolized trade with Spain, the Caribbean and South America. The speculative market for slaves, rum and mahogany spawned a frenzy that had ramifications throughout Europe when it collapsed. \"But Walpole bought at the bottom and sold at the top,\" Tinterow said. That fortune enabled him to build Houghton.}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nWalpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career. Voters and politicians nicknamed him \"Robin\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}\n\nLike his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]. After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181\u201382}}\n\nDespite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711. Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.  He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.<ref>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714\u20131760'' (1977) pp 206\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced \"guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption\".{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}\n\n==Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry==\n{{Main|First Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry|Second Stanhope\u2013Sunderland ministry}}\nQueen Anne died in 1714. Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by her [[second cousin]], the [[Elector of Hanover]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years. Robert Walpole became a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] and rose to the position of [[Paymaster of the Forces]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}} in a Cabinet nominally led by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], but actually dominated by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law) and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]. Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cihm_20078 archive.org: \"A Report from the Committee of Secrecy, appointed by order of the House of Commons: to examine several books and papers laid before the House, relating to the late negociations of peace and commerce, &c. : reported on the ninth of June, 1715\"] by Robert Walpole, Chairman</ref> [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] was impeached, and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Lord Bolingbroke]] suffered from an [[Bill of attainder|act of attainder]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}}\n\nLord Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715 and by 1716 Walpole was appointed to the posts of [[First Lord of the Treasury|First Commissioner (Lord) of the Treasury]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He was a  member of the ''Board of General Officers'' established in 1717 to investigate the abuse of pay. Walpole's fellow members, appointed by the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince of Wales]], included  [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath]] \u2013 Secretary at War, General Lumley, General Erle and [[Sir Philip Meadowes]] \u2013 Controller of the Army and [[Knight Marshal]] of the King's Palace,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Oldmixon|first1=Mr (John)|title=The History of England: During the Reigns of King William and Queen Mary, Queen Anne, King George I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvsiAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA627|publisher=T.

Normally, Walpole and Lord Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] on the other. Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart. The Stanhope\u2013Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support. In 1716 Townshend had been removed from the important post of [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]] and put in the lesser office of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} Even this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717.{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition \"because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on\",<ref>{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=185}} cites ''Parl.

He used his influence to prevent George II from entering the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733, because it was a dispute between the Bourbons and the Habsburgs. He boasted, \"There are 50,000 men slain in Europe this year, and not one Englishman.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Grant Robertson|title=England under the Hanoverians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVG7Nls67aQC&pg=PA66|year=1921|page=66}}</ref> By avoiding wars, Walpole could lower taxes.  He reduced the national debt with a sinking fund, and by negotiating lower interest rates.  He reduced the land tax from four shillings in 1721, to 3s in 1728, 2s in 1731 and finally to only 1s in 1732.  His long-term goal was to replace the land tax, which was paid by the local gentry, with excise and customs taxes, which were paid by merchants and ultimately by consumers.  Walpole joked that the landed gentry resembled hogs, which squealed loudly whenever anyone laid hands on him.  By contrast, he said, merchants were like sheep, and yielded their wool without complaint.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.W. Ward et al. eds. |title=The Cambridge Modern History: Volume VI: the Eighteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMgFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA46|year=1909|page=46}}</ref>  The joke backfired in 1733 when he was defeated in a major battle to impose excise taxes on wine and tobacco. To reduce the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants. Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it, but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.<ref>Paul Langford, ''A polite and commercial people: England, 1727-1783'' (1998). pp 28-33</ref>\n\nAfter the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before.

His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] who was estranged from his father, the King.

In the [[1741 British general election|1741 general election]] his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many [[rotten borough|pocket boroughs]] (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons).

These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.<ref>{{Citation |last=Speck|first=W.

Behind these political enemies were opposition Whigs, Tories and Jacobites. Walpole was alleged to have presided over an immense increase in corruption and to have enriched himself enormously whilst in office.

His former colleagues were still pleased to see him, perhaps in part because he retained the king's favour. After his resignation, his main political roles were to support the government by means of advice, to dole out some patronage and to speak on the ministry's behalf in the Lords.<ref>Jonathan Oates, \"Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742\u20131745.\" ''History 91.302'' (2006): 218-230.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nLord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington|Lord Wilmington]] in an administration whose true head was [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]].

Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the \"Minister behind the Curtain\" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of [[Henry Pelham]] whom he regarded as a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9.

The first was in January 1744 in the debate on Hanoverian troops being kept in British pay. Walpole prevented them from losing the troops. In his second intervention, Walpole, with fear of a Jacobite-inspired invasion in February 1744, made a speech on the situation.

The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]] was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons.

He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. ... With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.<ref>{{citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62\u201363}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]] expressed scepticism as to whether \"an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both\".{{sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114}} Chesterfield claimed he was \"much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life\":\n\n{{quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a Man in his Station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain Elevation of mind...He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived...Money, not Prerogative, was the chief Engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity...When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the ''Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning''; declaring himself at the same time, ''No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer''. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, ''well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser''. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart. ... His Name will not be recorded in History among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.{{sfn|Franklin|1993|pp=114\u2013115}} }}\n\n[[10 Downing Street]] represents another part of Walpole's legacy. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732, but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia Britannica\"/>\n\nWalpole has attracted attention from heterodox economists as a pioneer of protectionist policies, in the form of tariffs and subsidies to woollen manufacturers.

Regularly broadcast since 1990, it is loosely based on the [[BBC Radio 4]] show ''[[The News Quiz]]'' and has a topical and [[satirical]] remit.\n\n''Have I Got News for You'' is often cited as beginning the increasing domination of panel shows in British TV comedy, and remains one of the genre's key standard-bearers. In recognition of this, the show received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2011 [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Winners|url=http://www.britishcomedyawards.com/winners-2011.aspx|publisher=The British Comedy Academy|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref> It was the first time the honour had been bestowed upon a collective instead of an individual or double act. In 2016 they also received a [[BAFTA]] in the Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme category.\n\nThe programme is currently broadcasting its 59th series. The programme was shown on [[BBC Two]] for its first ten years, before moving to [[BBC One]]. The [[UKTV]] channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] carries regular repeats of the show.\n\n==Format==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[Image:HIGNFY Studio 2019.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Have I Got News for You'' studio]]\n''Have I Got News for You'' began on [[BBC2]] on 28 September 1990 and transferred to [[BBC One]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098820/?ref_=nv_sr_1 |title=Have I Got News For You |publisher=IMDB |date=2017 |accessdate= 2 March 2017}}</ref> \"Myself and Ian, we did a disastrous pilot for it,\" Paul Merton said nine years later.<ref name=\"South Bank Show\">''[[The South Bank Show]]'', 26 September 1999</ref> \"It was a beautiful summer's afternoon in 1990. Far too nice to be in a television studio, but I think the BBC had already bought it, so that's how it became a series.\"\n\nTwo series are made every year. At first, the number of episodes per series was inconsistent. However, a pattern soon formed at the start of series 3 in 1992 whereby the spring series between April and June comprises eight episodes and the autumn series from October to December contains nine, with a one-week break in the middle to allow the broadcasting of [[Children in Need]].\n\nFor its first 10 years, the programme was shown on [[BBC Two]]. In 2000, the BBC moved its nightly [[BBC One]] news bulletin, the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News]]'', from nine o'clock to ten o'clock (now known as the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'') after [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] moved their long-running ten o'clock bulletin, [[ITV News at Ten|''News at Ten'']], to eleven o'clock. This left a gap in the schedules, and ''Have I Got News for You'' was moved as a result to 9pm on Friday nights on BBC One.\n\nThe 39th series, broadcast in early 2010, moved the show to a Thursday night slot. The 40th series remained in this new time slot, despite one episode being broadcast the day after due to the [[Royal Variety Performance]]; both series featured an extra episode, with the spring series now featuring 9 episodes and the autumn series 10 episodes.\n\nOver an hour's worth of material is recorded for each 30-minute programme for broadcast the following day, allowing the programme to remain topical while the BBC's lawyers have time to request cuts of potentially defamatory material. As for its popularity, Merton explained that it was mostly [[word-of-mouth]]:  \"No reviewer could possibly review it in that time. We started off with an audience of two million, and somebody might have mentioned it to their friend, and then it sort of built up a momentum of its own.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\nThe late-night weekend repeat has occasionally contained extra material from the week's recording. This became a permanent feature from the spring 2007 series, with the repeat having a running time of 40 minutes, and being titled (in the TV listings) ''Have I Got a Bit More News for You''.<ref name=\"chortle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/04/11/5212/a_lot_more_news_for_you |title=A lot more news for you : News 2007 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally recorded at [[the London Studios]], former home of [[London Weekend Television]], and as of the start of the autumn 2018 season (Series 56, episode 1) <ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmgc4m |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU; BBC1 Listings |publisher=BBC |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> recording has now been moved to [[Elstree Studios]].<ref name=\"SRO Audiences\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sroaudiences.com/ |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU - Free audience tickets: SRO Audiences : the tv audience company |publisher=SRO Audiences |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> The [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 Election]] special episode was recorded at [[BBC Television Centre]] on the Friday morning after the election. The quiz aspect and scores are largely ignored in favour of the panellists' witty exchanges and jokes, and the format seems to change frequently.\n\n\"There's been a lot of confusion, with people saying, 'Well, they see the questions beforehand,' which we do,\" revealed Merton in 1999. \"But some people say we see the ''answers'', which we don't, because that would rob it of being a quiz.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n\"There is a certain amount of show business that goes on in putting on a show,\" continued Merton. \"We found very early on that it's worth seeing the questions beforehand so that you can work out your depth of ignorance. If you really don't know, you think, 'Well, I've really got to try and say something here.' It's much better to be doing that for ten or fifteen minutes before the show than be doing it when the cameras are rolling, in front of an audience, going, 'Well, who's he?'\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n[[Norman Tebbit]] wrote an article in ''[[Daily Mail|The Mail on Sunday]]'' criticising the whole programme: 'Well, of course ''Have I Got News for You'' is all edited. These people, they couldn't improvise live. You put them on a stage, they wouldn't be able to improvise.' Merton said of this: \"Well, when Norman Tebbit said I couldn't improvise, I was... [''blows out cheeks and then goes silent''].\"<ref>Quote taken from a show on Merton's \"and this is me PAUL MERTON\" tour of 1999, as featured in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' on 26 September 1999</ref>\n\n===Main section===\nThe main section of the show comprises several rounds, although, as noted above, this is liable to change. Since the show originally aired, several rounds have been dropped from the original format, but a typical show will usually consist of the following:\n* Round 1 is the \"Film Round\". Silent video clips, usually from news reports, are played to the teams. Two points are awarded for correctly identifying the story \u2013 but as the round covers the major stories of the week, the quiz aspect is downplayed here in favour of discussion and banter. The host will still ask questions to highlight details of a story, but no further points are awarded for the answers.\n** Sometimes, the clips used have been specially chosen from particular sources, such as in the 2008 Christmas special, which used clips from Christmas specials of various other TV programmes to provide the clues. The 1993 'Thatcher special' presented a slight variation called ''Who Dares Loses?'', where the teams had to identify who in the clip 'lost'.\n** On rare occasions, sound is added to the clip, such as a \"[[wikt:kerching|ker-ching]]\" in the montage that depicted the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MPs' expenses scandal]] or the ''[[Blue Peter]]'' theme tune in the week that presenter [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]] had been caught taking drugs.\n** The only occasion that the video clip element of this round has been deviated from was during series 37, when one of the clips was audio only with no pictures. The question was about [[the Hum]], which none of the panel could hear anyway.\n** Early series featured two similar games later in the show; the \"Connections Round\", with the panel identifying the individuals and the story that linked them, and the \"Archive Round\", featuring pre-1990 news footage in a 'what happened next?' format. Both were dropped as the more popular rounds began to use up more time.\n* Round 2 was originally the \"Tabloid Headlines Round\", in which the panellists identified and commented on the more flippant stories of the week from sufficiently pun-filled [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines.\n** Another of the original rounds later dropped was the similar \"Mini-Headlines Round\", where the panel had to identify a story from the four words used in the original tabloid report as effective chapter headings.\n** In 2004, the headlines were filtered out and replaced with a picture game. An image is slowly revealed to the teams, the object being for one to buzz in before the other and guess how the resulting person or object is relevant to the week's news. Originally this took the form of the \"Picture-Spin Quiz\". Regular variants since have included the \"[[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] of News\" and the Christmas-themed \"[[Giblets]] of News\", while others have featured wieldy props for the host, such as the \"[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel]] of News\", the \"[[Slot machine|One-Armed Bandit]] of News\" and the \"[[High striker|Strengthometer]] of News\". A few versions have been more specific to that week's guest host; e.g. [[Dominic West]], star of American cop drama ''[[The Wire]]'', had the \"[[Police car|Squad Car]] of News\".\n** Occasionally the round is themed around one topic. In these instances, it usually becomes a more straightforward Q&A 'fingers-on-[[buzzer]]s' round.\n** Another slight variation is a spoof of an existing quiz/gameshow, often done when pertinent to the current guests. For example; a mock ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' game when [[Magnus Magnusson]] appeared or the infamous \"Play Your Iraqi Cards Right\" from [[Bruce Forsyth]]'s first time as host, which took the format of [[Play Your Cards Right|the presenter's former game show]], as well as referencing a [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|special deck of cards]] produced by the Americans for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n* Round 3 is the \"Odd One Out Round\", where four personalities, characters and/or objects are presented to a team, whereupon they must identify the interloper, and the topical, amusing or ridiculously obscure link between the other three. In one episode, Merton's \"Odd One Out\" selection consisted of 16 images and in another, the round comprised four photos of [[Michael Howard]]. On another occasion the four choices were Hislop, Merton and both guests, [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Charles Kennedy]]. The four pictures used were the live remote feeds from the studio cameras. (This technique was also used in an episode hosted by [[Ronnie Corbett]], when the comedian featured as one of the choices.) One week, after it had been revealed that a group of celebrities had taken out [[gag order|press injunctions]], the round consisted of four blanked out images, with the host, Rhod Gilbert, explaining that they were unable to reveal who exactly was the odd one out, or the reason.\n** A short-lived variant was another take on the aforementioned \"Connections Round\", with images of three people given, the teams working out what linked them.\n** When Bruce Forsyth was host, this round was replaced by \"Conveyer Belt Connections\", a reference to the final round of ''[[The Generation Game]]''. One of the belts consisted of people and objects whose resulting connection was that they had all been the Odd One Out in previous editions of the show. This included the disparate grouping together of [[sewage|raw sewage]], ''[[The Hay Wain]]'', [[Tinky Winky]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].\n* Round 4 is the \"Missing Words Round\", where newspaper headlines are displayed, with choice words blanked out. The panellists then suggest what these could be. Since 1994, a regular feature of this round is that some of the banners are taken from that week's choice of obscure \"guest publication\". Over the years, these have included ''Goat World'', ''Arthritis News'', ''International Car Park Design'', \"The Caravan Times\" and ''Diarrhoea Digest''. Examples of Missing Words are \"I'll take Edward up the _____\", \"Church may be forced to sell _____\" and \"PM sucked into _____\".\n* After the final scores are read out, there is often an additional Caption Competition, where potentially amusing pictures are shown, to which the panellists are invited to provide an apt headline. No points are awarded for this section.\n\n==Participants==\n\nThe original line-up, from 1990 to 2002, was [[Angus Deayton]] as chairman, with [[Ian Hislop]], the editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ian-hislop-my-20-years-at-the-eye-421312.html |title=Ian Heslop: My 20 Years at the Eye |newspaper=Independent |date=2007 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> and comedian [[Paul Merton]] as team captains. Each captain was accompanied by a guest, usually a [[politician]], [[journalist]] or [[comedian]], or somebody particularly relevant to recent news.\n\nMerton took a break from ''Have I Got News for You'' during the 11th series in 1996, making only one appearance as a guest on Hislop's team. He was variously replaced as opposing team captain by [[Clive Anderson]], [[Alan Davies]] and [[Eddie Izzard]] (with another two episodes featuring an equal-billing [[double act]] as the opponents of Hislop's team). Merton later explained that at the time he was \"very tired\" of the show and that he thought it had become \"stuck in a rut\". Nevertheless, he added that he felt his absence gave the programme the \"shot in the arm\" it needed and that it had been \"better ever since\".<ref group=note>''The Very Best of Have I Got News for You'' (2002): DVD commentary</ref>\n\nIn May 2002, following newspaper headlines of his sex with a prostitute and use of illegal drugs,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1998242.stm |title=Deayton 'feels a fool' over reports |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Deayton was relentlessly ridiculed on the show by Hislop and Merton (along with guests [[Dave Gorman]] and [[Ken Livingstone]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2005881.stm |title=Deayton in the lion's den |work=BBC News |date=24 May 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Following a second round of revelations about his private life later in the year, leading to further mockery, Deayton was fired in October, two shows into series 24.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2373711.stm |title=Quiz host Deayton fired by BBC |work=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt short notice, Merton hosted the first episode after Deayton's departure, and was described as \"merciless\" in his treatment of his former co-star.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2384165.stm |title=Show goes on after Deayton exit |work=BBC News |date=1 November 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> A series of guest hosts appeared for the remainder of the series, including [[Anne Robinson]], [[Boris Johnson]], and [[Jeremy Clarkson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/12_december/07/news_clarkson.shtml |work=BBC Press Office |title=HIGNFY Jeremy Clarkson |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2002 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> Despite an initial search for a permanent successor to Deayton, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2984669.stm |title=TV quiz denies Clunes is new host |work=BBC News |date=29 April 2003 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> It was therefore announced in June 2003 that this feature would continue permanently.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jason |last=Deans |first2=Chris |last2=Tryhorn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jun/10/broadcasting.bbc |title=Forsyth boost for BBC news quiz |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nHislop is the only person to have appeared in every episode \u2014 despite suffering from [[appendicitis]] during one 1994 edition and having to go to [[hospital]] immediately afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=338 |title=\"I Hope the Lawyers Are Getting All This!\" \u2014 The ''Have I Got News For You'' Story |publisher=Off the Telly |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608045207/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=338 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from Merton, there are twelve other people who have appeared as a panellist after being a guest host: [[Clive Anderson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]], [[Marcus Brigstocke]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Alan Johnson]] (both of whom subsequently appeared as a guest host again), [[Charles Kennedy]], [[Richard Madeley]], [[Richard Osman]], [[Robert Peston]], [[John Prescott]] and [[Liza Tarbuck]].

Due to Carr's risqu\u00e9 material, Widdecombe vowed she would never appear on ''Have I Got News for You'' again.

The running time is just over three hours long, and there are several hours of extras, including, among other things, running commentary of the whole presentation by Merton and Hislop. Also featured is a clip of [[Terry Wogan]] on ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]'', nominating the programme as one of his pet hates. In addition, interviews with political figures (taken from the [[Channel 4]] Politics Awards) reveal their opinions on the series.\n\n''Have I Got News For You: The Best of the Guest Presenters'' (2003), which, as well as including the normal half-hour cut of [[Boris Johnson]]'s first guest-hosting, also included a bonus disc, \"The Full Boris\", which showed a far longer cut of the same episode (lasting slightly under 60 minutes).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/11/09/top-10-have-i-got-news-for-you-guest-hosts-boris-johnson-to-damian-lewis-616645/ |title=Top 10 Have I Got News For You guest hosts: Damian Lewis to Boris Johnson |publisher=DMG Media|work=Metro |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> Slightly longer versions of the shows featuring [[Martin Clunes]], [[William Hague]] and [[Bruce Forsyth]] as chairman were also included, as well as a compilation of clips taken from other editions from the first two series with guest hosts (with only the episode hosted by [[Liza Tarbuck]] not represented). There are also several small extra features, including a discussion between Paul Merton and Boris Johnson regarding Johnson's appearance as presenter, filmed during his appearance as the celebrity guest on the Merton-hosted ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]''.\n\n''Have I Got News For You: The Best of the Guest Presenters Vol. 2'' (2005), which is nearer in content to the first \"Best of\" DVD compilation than its direct predecessor. It contains four 45-minute compilations of the Autumn 2003, Spring 2004, Autumn 2004 and Spring 2005 series, rather than complete episodes; although it does again contain a bonus disc with an uncut version of Boris Johnson's second stint as presenter. This episode lasts about 80 minutes. \"The A to Z of HIGNFY\" is also included on the second disc. Each letter is used to stand for a different term or name often associated with the show, each highlighted by various example clips \u2013 except for the \"problem letters\" of X, Y and Z, which just lead into a selection of random outtakes. This feature also includes some behind-the-scenes content, with [[Marcus Brigstocke]] guiding the viewer around the studio and backstage, on a recording night.\n\n==Internet spin-offs==\nDuring the late 1990s, the website haveigotnewsforyou.com, run in association with [[Freeserve]], featured interactive versions of the show's games, including the missing words round and the caption competition, with prizes up for grabs.\n\n''Have I Got News for You'' started broadcasting a [[video podcast]], ''The Inevitable Internet Spin-off'', on 13 April 2007.<ref name=\"chortle\"/> It was initially planned to run for six series, from series 33 to 38, taking it to the end of 2009. Referred to as \"[[webisode]]s\", episodes are available via both the BBC iPlayer and [[YouTube]].\n\nFrom the beginning of Series 37, a new internet feature, ''Have I Got News for You, News... for You'', was introduced. A short programme featuring typical opening and closing sequences (without the presence of a live audience) as well as other short sketches, it has so far been presented by [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]], and run fortnightly, bridging the gap between series 37 and 38.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/04/have_i_got_news_internet_spinoff_to_bridge_tv_run.html |title=Have I Got News for You internet spin-off to bridge TV run |publisher=BroadcastNow |date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Other shows based on the ''Have I Got News for You'' format==\n\nSimilar shows based on the ''Have I Got News for You'' format exist in other countries:\n* American weekly radio show ''[[Wait Wait...

Frequently the same stories are covered on both Wait Wait and Have I Got News for You. Differences include, listeners calling in to win mini games and a celebrity interview and quiz in the middle of the show.

In 2016 they also received a [[BAFTA]] in the Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme category.\n\nThe programme is currently broadcasting it\u2019s 59th series. The programme was shown on [[BBC Two]] for its first ten years, before moving to [[BBC One]]. The [[UKTV]] channel [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] carries regular repeats of the show.\n\n==Format==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\n[[Image:HIGNFY Studio 2019.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Have I Got News for You'' studio]]\n''Have I Got News for You'' began on [[BBC2]] on 28 September 1990 and transferred to [[BBC One]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098820/?ref_=nv_sr_1 |title=Have I Got News For You |publisher=IMDB |date=2017 |accessdate= 2 March 2017}}</ref> \"Myself and Ian, we did a disastrous pilot for it,\" Paul Merton said nine years later.<ref name=\"South Bank Show\">''[[The South Bank Show]]'', 26 September 1999</ref> \"It was a beautiful summer's afternoon in 1990. Far too nice to be in a television studio, but I think the BBC had already bought it, so that's how it became a series.\"\n\nTwo series are made every year. At first, the number of episodes per series was inconsistent. However, a pattern soon formed at the start of series 3 in 1992 whereby the spring series between April and June comprises eight episodes and the autumn series from October to December contains nine, with a one-week break in the middle to allow the broadcasting of [[Children in Need]].\n\nFor its first 10 years, the programme was shown on [[BBC Two]]. In 2000, the BBC moved its nightly [[BBC One]] news bulletin, the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News]]'', from nine o'clock to ten o'clock (now known as the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'') after [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] moved their long-running ten o'clock bulletin, [[ITV News at Ten|''News at Ten'']], to eleven o'clock. This left a gap in the schedules, and ''Have I Got News for You'' was moved as a result to 9pm on Friday nights on BBC One.\n\nThe 39th series, broadcast in early 2010, moved the show to a Thursday night slot. The 40th series remained in this new time slot, despite one episode being broadcast the day after due to the [[Royal Variety Performance]]; both series featured an extra episode, with the spring series now featuring 9 episodes and the autumn series 10 episodes.\n\nOver an hour's worth of material is recorded for each 30-minute programme for broadcast the following day, allowing the programme to remain topical while the BBC's lawyers have time to request cuts of potentially defamatory material. As for its popularity, Merton explained that it was mostly [[word-of-mouth]]:  \"No reviewer could possibly review it in that time. We started off with an audience of two million, and somebody might have mentioned it to their friend, and then it sort of built up a momentum of its own.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\nThe late-night weekend repeat has occasionally contained extra material from the week's recording. This became a permanent feature from the spring 2007 series, with the repeat having a running time of 40 minutes, and being titled (in the TV listings) ''Have I Got a Bit More News for You''.<ref name=\"chortle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/04/11/5212/a_lot_more_news_for_you |title=A lot more news for you : News 2007 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide |publisher=Chortle |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2017-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally recorded at [[the London Studios]], former home of [[London Weekend Television]], and as of the start of the autumn 2018 season (Series 56, episode 1) <ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmgc4m |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU; BBC1 Listings |publisher=BBC |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> recording has now been moved to [[Elstree Studios]].<ref name=\"SRO Audiences\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sroaudiences.com/ |title=HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU - Free audience tickets: SRO Audiences : the tv audience company |publisher=SRO Audiences |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-05-18}}</ref> The [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 Election]] special episode was recorded at [[BBC Television Centre]] on the Friday morning after the election. The quiz aspect and scores are largely ignored in favour of the panellists' witty exchanges and jokes, and the format seems to change frequently.\n\n\"There's been a lot of confusion, with people saying, 'Well, they see the questions beforehand,' which we do,\" revealed Merton in 1999. \"But some people say we see the ''answers'', which we don't, because that would rob it of being a quiz.\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n\"There is a certain amount of show business that goes on in putting on a show,\" continued Merton. \"We found very early on that it's worth seeing the questions beforehand so that you can work out your depth of ignorance. If you really don't know, you think, 'Well, I've really got to try and say something here.' It's much better to be doing that for ten or fifteen minutes before the show than be doing it when the cameras are rolling, in front of an audience, going, 'Well, who's he?'\"<ref name=\"South Bank Show\"/>\n\n[[Norman Tebbit]] wrote an article in ''[[Daily Mail|The Mail on Sunday]]'' criticising the whole programme: 'Well, of course ''Have I Got News for You'' is all edited. These people, they couldn't improvise live. You put them on a stage, they wouldn't be able to improvise.' Merton said of this: \"Well, when Norman Tebbit said I couldn't improvise, I was... [''blows out cheeks and then goes silent''].\"<ref>Quote taken from a show on Merton's \"and this is me PAUL MERTON\" tour of 1999, as featured in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' on 26 September 1999</ref>\n\n===Main section===\nThe main section of the show comprises several rounds, although, as noted above, this is liable to change. Since the show originally aired, several rounds have been dropped from the original format, but a typical show will usually consist of the following:\n* Round 1 is the \"Film Round\". Silent video clips, usually from news reports, are played to the teams. Two points are awarded for correctly identifying the story \u2013 but as the round covers the major stories of the week, the quiz aspect is downplayed here in favour of discussion and banter. The host will still ask questions to highlight details of a story, but no further points are awarded for the answers.\n** Sometimes, the clips used have been specially chosen from particular sources, such as in the 2008 Christmas special, which used clips from Christmas specials of various other TV programmes to provide the clues. The 1993 'Thatcher special' presented a slight variation called ''Who Dares Loses?'', where the teams had to identify who in the clip 'lost'.\n** On rare occasions, sound is added to the clip, such as a \"[[wikt:kerching|ker-ching]]\" in the montage that depicted the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MPs' expenses scandal]] or the ''[[Blue Peter]]'' theme tune in the week that presenter [[Richard Bacon (TV presenter)|Richard Bacon]] had been caught taking drugs.\n** The only occasion that the video clip element of this round has been deviated from was during series 37, when one of the clips was audio only with no pictures. The question was about [[the Hum]], which none of the panel could hear anyway.\n** Early series featured two similar games later in the show; the \"Connections Round\", with the panel identifying the individuals and the story that linked them, and the \"Archive Round\", featuring pre-1990 news footage in a 'what happened next?' format. Both were dropped as the more popular rounds began to use up more time.\n* Round 2 was originally the \"Tabloid Headlines Round\", in which the panellists identified and commented on the more flippant stories of the week from sufficiently pun-filled [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines.\n** Another of the original rounds later dropped was the similar \"Mini-Headlines Round\", where the panel had to identify a story from the four words used in the original tabloid report as effective chapter headings.\n** In 2004, the headlines were filtered out and replaced with a picture game. An image is slowly revealed to the teams, the object being for one to buzz in before the other and guess how the resulting person or object is relevant to the week's news. Originally this took the form of the \"Picture-Spin Quiz\". Regular variants since have included the \"[[Jigsaw puzzle|Jigsaw]] of News\" and the Christmas-themed \"[[Giblets]] of News\", while others have featured wieldy props for the host, such as the \"[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel]] of News\", the \"[[Slot machine|One-Armed Bandit]] of News\" and the \"[[High striker|Strengthometer]] of News\". A few versions have been more specific to that week's guest host; e.g. [[Dominic West]], star of American cop drama ''[[The Wire]]'', had the \"[[Police car|Squad Car]] of News\".\n** Occasionally the round is themed around one topic. In these instances, it usually becomes a more straightforward Q&A 'fingers-on-[[buzzer]]s' round.\n** Another slight variation is a spoof of an existing quiz/gameshow, often done when pertinent to the current guests. For example; a mock ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' game when [[Magnus Magnusson]] appeared or the infamous \"Play Your Iraqi Cards Right\" from [[Bruce Forsyth]]'s first time as host, which took the format of [[Play Your Cards Right|the presenter's former game show]], as well as referencing a [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|special deck of cards]] produced by the Americans for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n* Round 3 is the \"Odd One Out Round\", where four personalities, characters and/or objects are presented to a team, whereupon they must identify the interloper, and the topical, amusing or ridiculously obscure link between the other three. In one episode, Merton's \"Odd One Out\" selection consisted of 16 images and in another, the round comprised four photos of [[Michael Howard]]. On another occasion the four choices were Hislop, Merton and both guests, [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Charles Kennedy]]. The four pictures used were the live remote feeds from the studio cameras. (This technique was also used in an episode hosted by [[Ronnie Corbett]], when the comedian featured as one of the choices.) One week, after it had been revealed that a group of celebrities had taken out [[gag order|press injunctions]], the round consisted of four blanked out images, with the host, Rhod Gilbert, explaining that they were unable to reveal who exactly was the odd one out, or the reason.\n** A short-lived variant was another take on the aforementioned \"Connections Round\", with images of three people given, the teams working out what linked them.\n** When Bruce Forsyth was host, this round was replaced by \"Conveyer Belt Connections\", a reference to the final round of ''[[The Generation Game]]''. One of the belts consisted of people and objects whose resulting connection was that they had all been the Odd One Out in previous editions of the show. This included the disparate grouping together of [[sewage|raw sewage]], ''[[The Hay Wain]]'', [[Tinky Winky]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].\n* Round 4 is the \"Missing Words Round\", where newspaper headlines are displayed, with choice words blanked out. The panellists then suggest what these could be. Since 1994, a regular feature of this round is that some of the banners are taken from that week's choice of obscure \"guest publication\". Over the years, these have included ''Goat World'', ''Arthritis News'', ''International Car Park Design'', \"The Caravan Times\" and ''Diarrhoea Digest''. Examples of Missing Words are \"I'll take Edward up the _____\", \"Church may be forced to sell _____\" and \"PM sucked into _____\".\n* After the final scores are read out, there is often an additional Caption Competition, where potentially amusing pictures are shown, to which the panellists are invited to provide an apt headline. No points are awarded for this section.\n\n==Participants==\n\nThe original line-up, from 1990 to 2002, was [[Angus Deayton]] as chairman, with [[Ian Hislop]], the editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ian-hislop-my-20-years-at-the-eye-421312.html |title=Ian Heslop: My 20 Years at the Eye |newspaper=Independent |date=2007 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> and comedian [[Paul Merton]] as team captains. Each captain was accompanied by a guest, usually a [[politician]], [[journalist]] or [[comedian]], or somebody particularly relevant to recent news.\n\nMerton took a break from ''Have I Got News for You'' during the 11th series in 1996, making only one appearance as a guest on Hislop's team. He was variously replaced as opposing team captain by [[Clive Anderson]], [[Alan Davies]] and [[Eddie Izzard]] (with another two episodes featuring an equal-billing [[double act]] as the opponents of Hislop's team). Merton later explained that at the time he was \"very tired\" of the show and that he thought it had become \"stuck in a rut\". Nevertheless, he added that he felt his absence gave the programme the \"shot in the arm\" it needed and that it had been \"better ever since\".<ref group=note>''The Very Best of Have I Got News for You'' (2002): DVD commentary</ref>\n\nIn May 2002, following newspaper headlines of his sex with a prostitute and use of illegal drugs,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1998242.stm |title=Deayton 'feels a fool' over reports |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Deayton was relentlessly ridiculed on the show by Hislop and Merton (along with guests [[Dave Gorman]] and [[Ken Livingstone]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2005881.stm |title=Deayton in the lion's den |work=BBC News |date=24 May 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Following a second round of revelations about his private life later in the year, leading to further mockery, Deayton was fired in October, two shows into series 24.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2373711.stm |title=Quiz host Deayton fired by BBC |work=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt short notice, Merton hosted the first episode after Deayton's departure, and was described as \"merciless\" in his treatment of his former co-star.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2384165.stm |title=Show goes on after Deayton exit |work=BBC News |date=1 November 2002 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> A series of guest hosts appeared for the remainder of the series, including [[Anne Robinson]], [[Boris Johnson]], and [[Jeremy Clarkson]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/12_december/07/news_clarkson.shtml |work=BBC Press Office |title=HIGNFY Jeremy Clarkson |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2002 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> Despite an initial search for a permanent successor to Deayton, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2984669.stm |title=TV quiz denies Clunes is new host |work=BBC News |date=29 April 2003 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> It was therefore announced in June 2003 that this feature would continue permanently.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jason |last=Deans |first2=Chris |last2=Tryhorn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jun/10/broadcasting.bbc |title=Forsyth boost for BBC news quiz |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nHislop is the only person to have appeared in every episode \u2014 despite suffering from [[appendicitis]] during one 1994 edition and having to go to [[hospital]] immediately afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=338 |title=\"I Hope the Lawyers Are Getting All This!\" \u2014 The ''Have I Got News For You'' Story |publisher=Off the Telly |accessdate=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608045207/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?page_id=338 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from Merton, there are twelve other people who have appeared as a panellist after being a guest host: [[Clive Anderson]], [[Gyles Brandreth]], [[Marcus Brigstocke]], [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Alan Johnson]] (both of whom subsequently appeared as a guest host again), [[Charles Kennedy]], [[Richard Madeley]], [[Richard Osman]], [[Robert Peston]], [[John Prescott]] and [[Liza Tarbuck]].

The running time is just over three hours long, and there are several hours of extras, including, among other things, running commentary of the whole presentation by Merton and Hislop. Also featured is a clip of [[Terry Wogan]] on ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]'', nominating the programme as one of his pet hates. In addition, interviews with political figures (taken from the [[Channel 4]] Politics Awards) reveal their opinions on the series.\n\n''Have I Got News For You: The Best of the Guest Presenters'' (2003), which, as well as including the normal half-hour cut of [[Boris Johnson]]'s first guest-hosting, also included a bonus disc, \"The Full Boris\", which showed a far longer cut of the same episode (lasting slightly under 60 minutes).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/11/09/top-10-have-i-got-news-for-you-guest-hosts-boris-johnson-to-damian-lewis-616645/ |title=Top 10 Have I Got News For You guest hosts: Damian Lewis to Boris Johnson |publisher=DMG Media|work=Metro |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> Slightly longer versions of the shows featuring [[Martin Clunes]], [[William Hague]] and [[Bruce Forsyth]] as chairman were also included, as well as a compilation of clips taken from other editions from the first two series with guest hosts (with only the episode hosted by [[Liza Tarbuck]] not represented).

It contains four 45-minute compilations of the Autumn 2003, Spring 2004, Autumn 2004 and Spring 2005 series, rather than complete episodes; although it does again contain a bonus disc with an uncut version of Boris Johnson's second stint as presenter. This episode lasts about 80 minutes. \"The A to Z of HIGNFY\" is also included on the second disc. Each letter is used to stand for a different term or name often associated with the show, each highlighted by various example clips \u2013 except for the \"problem letters\" of X, Y and Z, which just lead into a selection of random outtakes.

Frequently the same stories are covered on both Wait Wait and Have I Got News for You. Differences include, listeners calling in to win mini games and a celebrity interview and quiz in the middle of the show.

The Initiation Level (Level I) is designed for someone who has never coached rowing before, the Foundation Level (Level II) is for a coach with about one year's experience and the Intermediate Level (Level III) is for the new varsity coach or an assistant with five years of experience.\n\nFor coaches whose experience goes beyond what is offered in the certification program, USRowing offers the Advanced Coaches Series at the USRowing Annual Convention. This program brings together expert speakers from around the rowing world, as well as other sports-related disciplines.\n\nContinuing education clinics are presentations designed by the USRowing staff and a local host organization.

It contains provisions covering both public- and private-sector workers. The private-sector provision forbids employers from discriminating against any individual because of age; the public-sector provision requires that employment decisions be made free from any discrimination based on age.<ref name= Preview>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/01/argument-preview-what-counts-as-discrimination-based-on-age|title=Argument preview: What counts as discrimination \u201cbased on\u201d age?|last=Garden|first=Charlotte|date=2020-01-08|website=SCOTUSBlog|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> \n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in ''[[McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green]]''. This opinion was one of the first times the Supreme Court described in detail how the burden of proof works in discrimination cases. In the ''McDonnell Douglas'' case, the Court established that plaintiffs must first establish a [[prima facie]] case for discrimination. Next, the defendant (employer) has the opportunity to produce evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions. If the defendant/employer does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff who then must try to prove that the defendant's non-discriminatory reasons are pretextual or otherwise insufficient under the law. This framework, known as the [[McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis]], is now used by federal courts to interpret employment discrimination claims where no direct evidence of discriminatory intent can be found.<ref name= LawDaily/>\n\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court issued its opinion on ''[[Gross v.

In a 5-4 opinion, the Court ruled that private-sector plaintiffs must prove that age was the \"but for\" cause of the adverse employment action they are suing over.<ref name= Preview/><ref name= LawDaily/> That is, the plaintiff must prove that age discrimination was the determining reason for the adverse employment action (e.g. the action would not have been taken 'but for' the plaintiff's age).<ref name= Forbes>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciagbarnes/2019/10/04/high-court-to-address-the-muddled-mess-of-the-age-discrimination-in-employment-act/#72d6e76615a8|title=High Court To Address The Muddled Mess Of The Age Discrimination In Employment Act|last=Barnes|first=Patricia|date=2019-10-04|website=Forbes|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> However, the Supreme Court's opinion did not explicitly mention public-sector workers.<ref name= Newsweek>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/what-wednesdays-supreme-court-case-could-mean-age-discrimination-workplace-1480157|title=WHAT WEDNESDAY'S SUPREME COURT CASE COULD MEAN FOR AGE DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE|last=Moyler|first=Hunter|date=2020-01-14|website=Newsweek|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> A later opinion, ''[[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v.

In 2009, Babb obtained an advanced designation which allowed her to practice [[Disease management (health)|disease state management]] (DSM) - an advanced scope of practice which allowed her to prescribe medications for certain conditions without consulting a physician. In 2010, the VA created the [[Veterans_Health_Administration#Patient_Aligned_Care_Team_(PACT)|Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) system]]; among other effects, this initiative allowed pharmacists who practiced DSM (including Babb) to receive a [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|promotion]]. Babb, along with other pharmacists at the center, sought promotions under the new system. However, some of the pharmacists came to believe that the new requirements were being implemented in a discriminatory way. In 2011, two other pharmacists filed a complaint with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC); Babb testified in support of these complaints. Additionally, Babb filed a complaint of her own in 2013 after management sought to remove Babb's advanced designations and denied her request for additional training or practice opportunities. In 2014, she filed a federal lawsuit against the VA, alleging that management at the medical center discriminated against her based on gender and age and also retaliated against her for protected EEOC-related activity.<ref name= Preview/>\n\n== In lower courts ==\n\nBabb's lawsuit against [[Robert Wilkie]], the [[United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs]], was filed in July 2014 in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]]. The Secretary filed a motion for [[summary judgment]], which the district court granted. The court found, under the [[McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting]] framework, that Babb had succeeded in establishing her prima facie case for discrimination; that the Secretary had offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and nonretaliatory reasons for the VA's actions; and that Babb could not prove that the reasons provided were pretextual. Accordingly, the court ruled in favor of the Secretary. The district court also dismissed Babb's hostile work environment claim, ruling the remarks that Babb noted in her complaint were not sufficiently severe and pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment.<ref name= Preview/><ref name= NYTimes/>\n\nBabb appealed the district court's decision to the [[UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT|United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]].<ref name= LawDaily/> In July 2018, the 11th circuit affirmed the district court's summary judgment on the ADEA, retaliation, and hostile work environment claims.<ref name= LawDaily/> Babb appealed again, this time to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted her [[writ of certiorari]] and agreed to hear the case on June 28, 2019. They opted to limit their review to the issue of whether the federal-sector provision of the ADEA requires that the plaintiff prove that age was the 'but for' cause of the challenged action.<ref name= NYTimes/><ref name= BloombergLaw/>\n\n== At the Supreme Court ==\n\nOral arguments in this case took place on January 15, 2020.<ref name= Boomer>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/01/a-view-from-the-courtroom-ok-boomer/|title=A \u201cview\u201d from the courtroom: \u201cOK, boomer\u201d|last=Walsh|first=Mark|date=2020-01-15|website=SCOTUSBlog|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> Babb was represented by Roman Martinez, an attorney with the law firm of [[Latham & Watkins]]. The VA was represented by [[Noel Francisco]], the [[Solicitor General of the United States]].\n\nDuring the oral arguments, Babb's attorney Martinez emphasized the language of the ADEA and distinguished the wording used for public-sector employees from the wording used for private-sector employees. He noted that for public sector employees, the statute requires that employment decisions be made \"free from\" age-related bias, which he argued was broader in scope and meaning than the language used for private-sector employees under the ADEA. He argued that Congress's intent was to bar discrimination at any point in the employment process, even if the age-related discrimination was the final determinative factor in the decision.\n\nArguing for the government, Francisco countered that the VA's interpretation of the statute would harmonize the rules for both public- and private-sector employees (imposing the 'but for' standard uniformly on all categories). In addition, he argued that other statutes such as the Civil Service Reform Act would offer the remedies that Babb was seeking under the ADEA. On January 17, 2020, the Supreme Court directed both parties to file supplemental briefs on what other judicial or administrative remedies would be available (other than the ADEA) to plaintiffs like Babb. <ref name= Boomer/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2020 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]\n[[Category:United States employment discrimination case law]]\n[[Category:United States gender discrimination case law]]\n[[Category:United States statutory interpretation case law]]\n[[Category:United States public employment case law]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pending United States Supreme Court case}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox SCOTUS case\n  |Litigants=Babb v.

The VA was represented by [[Noel Francisco]], the [[Solicitor General of the United States]].\n\nDuring the oral arguments, Babb's attorney Martinez emphasized the language of the ADEA and distinguished the wording used for public-sector employees from the wording used for private-sector employees. He noted that for public sector employees, the statute requires that employment decisions be made \"free from\" age-related bias, which he argued was broader in scope and meaning than the language used for private-sector employees under the ADEA. He argued that Congress's intent was to bar discrimination at any point in the employment process, even if the age-related discrimination was the final determinative factor in the decision.\n\nArguing for the government, Francisco countered that the VA's interpretation of the statute would harmonize the rules for both public- and private-sector employees (imposing the 'but for' standard uniformly on all categories). In addition, he argued that other statutes such as the Civil Service Reform Act would offer the remedies that Babb was seeking under the ADEA. On January 17, 2020, the Supreme Court directed both parties to file supplemental briefs on what other judicial or administrative remedies would be available (other than the ADEA) to plaintiffs like Babb. <ref name= Boomer/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2020 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]\n[[Category:United States employment discrimination case law]]\n[[Category:United States gender discrimination case law]]\n[[Category:United States statutory interpretation case law]]\n[[Category:United States public employment case law]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegal background:Typo fixing, replaced: provision provision \u2192 provision", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babb_v._Wilkie"}

[[Scottish Rowing]] (formerly SARA) and [[Welsh Rowing]] (formerly WARA) oversee governance in their respective countries, organise their own teams for the [[Home International Regatta]] and input to the GB team organisation.\n\nBritish Rowing is a member of the [[British Olympic Association]] and the [[International Federation of Rowing Associations|International Rowing Federation]], also known as '''FISA'''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ARA Lower Mall plaque.jpg|thumb|right|ARA plaque]]\nThe ARA (as the predecessor of British Rowing) had it roots in the desire to form crews drawn from the leading English clubs 'for the purpose of defeating the foreign or colonial invader' although in fact this aim was not fulfilled until much later.\n\nA series of meetings were held in [[Putney]] from 1877 culminating in the formation of the [[Metropolitan Rowing Association]] in 1879<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22196 ''Sport, ancient and modern: Pastimes'', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford,  East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 283-292.

Points are increased by members winning qualifying regattas.\n\nThe current status levels are (high to low) Elite (ELI), Senior (SEN), Intermediate 1 (IM1), Intermediate 2 (IM2), Intermediate 3 (IM3), Novice (NV).  Each crew members' points are added up and this determines the status of the crew.
