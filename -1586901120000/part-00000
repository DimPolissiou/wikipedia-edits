It was dedicated by Christie: \"To [[Margaret Rutherford]], in admiration.\"\n\nThe novel received good reviews on publication, for \"the shrewd exposition of what makes a female film star tick\",<ref name=Iles1962 /> and being easy to read, though the plot was not as \"taut\" as some of Christie's novels.<ref name=Richardson1962 /> A later review found it \"one of the best of her later books\" and liked the way that \"the changes in village life and class structure since the [[second world war|war]] are detailed\".<ref name=Barnard1990 />\n\n==Plot summary==\nWhile recovering from an illness, Jane Marple goes out for a walk in St. Mary Mead and takes a fall. She encounters Heather Badcock, who brings her to her home and relates a story of meeting American actress Marina Gregg, who has moved to England to star in a film about [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth of Austria]] and purchased Gossington Hall from Marple's friend Dolly Bantry. \n\nGregg and her latest husband, producer Jason Rudd, host a f\u00eate at Gossington Hall in honor of [[St John Ambulance (England)|St John Ambulance]]. Among the guests in attendance are Mrs Bantry, actress Lola Brewster, Gregg's personal friend Ardwyck Fenn, and Heather Badcock and her husband Arthur. All five are invited to a private room to meet Marina and have their picture taken. \n\nUpon meeting Gregg, Heather shares the story of meeting her in [[Bermuda]] and receiving her autograph, during which Mrs Bantry notices a strange look cross Gregg's face. Mrs Bantry then takes several other women to see the renovations made to the house only to be interrupted upon discovering Heather has collapsed without explanation. Despite all attempts to revive her, Heather is pronounced dead.\n\nMrs. Bantry informs Marple about the events surrounding the f\u00eate and the frozen look on Marina's face, comparing it to a phrase from [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]''. Detective-Inspector Dermot Craddock spearheads the investigation, learning that Heather died as a result of ingesting six times the recommended dose of the tranquilizer Calmo. The drug had been slipped into a [[daiquiri]] that originally belonged to Gregg but was offered to Heather after someone jogged her arm and caused her to spill her drink. \n\nOperating on the assumption that Gregg was the intended target, Craddock proceeds to delve into her complicated past. Desperate to have a child of her own, she married several times but was unable to conceive. She then adopted three children but became pregnant and gave birth to a mentally disabled son before suffering a nervous breakdown. One of the children, Margot Bence, is revealed to have been present at Gossington Hall on the day of the f\u00eate but she denies killing Heather despite her hatred towards her adoptive mother.\n\nAs the investigation continues, two more people are killed over the course of twenty-four hours. Rudd's social secretary, Ella Zielinsky, dies first from cyanide poisoning after the [[Nebulizer|atomizer]] she uses for her hay fever is tainted with prussic acid. Later that night, Gregg's butler, Giuseppe, is shot twice in the back in his bedroom after spending the day in London and depositing \u00a3500 into his bank account. Ardwyck Fenn informs Craddock he received a phone call several days before, accusing him of killing Heather, and he recognized the anonymous caller as Ella when she sneezed.  \n\nMarple's house cleaner, Cherry Baker, reveals her friend Gladys, who was a server at Gossington Hall on the day of the f\u00eate, told her she believes Heather deliberately spilled the cocktail and that she was going to meet Giuseppe before he died. After sending Gladys on a vacation to [[Bournemouth]] and phoning the vicar, she travels to Gossington Hall only to discover Gregg died in her sleep from an overdose.\n\nWith Craddock and Rudd present, Marple reconstructs the moment when Heather recounted the story of her meeting Gregg in Bermuda, ultimately revealing that Gregg was the murderer all along. Heather, who was suffering from [[Rubella|German measles]] at the time, was indirectly responsible for Gregg's son being born disabled and for Gregg herself suffering a nervous breakdown. Overcome with rage, Gregg doctored her own daiquiri before making it so that Heather drank it. She then tried to convince everyone the poisoned drink was meant for her and killed Ella and Giuseppe after they deduced she was the killer. Marple sent Gladys away to protect her from becoming Gregg's next victim.\n\nMarple then implies Rudd administered the overdose to protect her and to prevent her from taking another life. Rudd neither confirms nor denies her suspicions, instead commenting on his wife's beauty and the suffering she endured.\n\n==Explanation of the title==\nThe title of the novel comes from the poem ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. The Lady of Shalott lives in a tower near Camelot, and sees it only reflected in a glass. She will be doomed if she looks directly; when Lancelot appears, she looks directly at him and Camelot and the looking glass cracks. This poem is referred to by name several times in the novel, with these lines quoted:\n\n:Out flew the web and floated wide-\n:The mirror crack'd from side to side;\n:\"The curse is come upon me,\" cried\n:The Lady of Shalott.\n\nAt the end, Miss Marple quotes the last three lines in referring to the dead actress:\n\n:He said, \"She has a lovely face;\n:God in his mercy lend her grace,\n:The Lady of Shalott.\"\n\n==Characters==\n*[[Miss Marple]]: Detective of St Mary Mead, recovering from an illness.\n*Mrs Cherry Baker: Young house cleaner for Miss Marple; she lives in the new development of [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] homes.\n*Jim Baker: Husband of Cherry; he does repair tasks for Miss Marple.\n*Miss Knight: Works as carer for Miss Marple, sent by Miss Marple's nephew [[Raymond West]], while she is recuperating from an illness.

He is at ease with the film actors.\n*Frank Cornish: Inspector for St Mary Mead.\n\n==Literary significance and reception==\nFrancis Iles ([[Anthony Berkeley Cox]]) was somewhat muted in his praise in his review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of 7 December 1962 when he said, \n<blockquote>\"she has of course thought up one more brilliant little peg on which to hang her plot, but the chief interest to me of ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'' was the shrewd exposition of what makes a female film star tick the way she does tick. And though one could accept a single coincidence concerning that married couple, the second and quite wildly improbable one tends to destroy faith in the story \u2013 still more so since it leads nowhere at all.\"<ref name=Iles1962>{{cite news |last=Iles |first=Frances |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 December 1962 |page=9 |title=Review}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMaurice Richardson of ''[[The Observer]]''  of 11 November 1962 summed up, \"A moderate Christie; bit diffuse and not so taut as some; still fairly easy to read, though.\"<ref name=Richardson1962>{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Maurice |newspaper=The Observer |title=Review |date=11 November 1962 |page=24}}</ref>\n\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a short review, noting Miss Marple's complaints about the limits imposed on her by getting old, yet nothing stops her mind from working well. The novel is summed up by this upbeat remark: \"It was her prying curiosity - her gift of putting odd bits together to form a picture that gave the locals and Scotland Yard the proper solution. Long life to her.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/agatha-christie/the-mirror-crackd-from-side-to-side/ |title=The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, Review |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |orig-year=September 1, 1963 |date= September 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]], writing in 1990, said this novel was \"The last of the true English village mysteries in Christie's output, and one of the best of her later books.

[[Congenital rubella syndrome]] was passed on to the baby. Little Daria was born prematurely, weighing only 3 pounds, 2 ounces, and requiring a total blood transfusion. The infant was deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely developmentally disabled. The child ultimately was institutionalised in a [[psychiatric hospital]].\n\nAbout two years after the child was born, Tierney was approached by a female fan for an autograph at a garden party.<ref name=Demaret1979>{{cite news |url=http://people.com/archive/gene-tierney-began-her-trip-back-from-madness-on-a-ledge-14-floors-above-the-street-vol-11-no-18/ |first=Kent |last=Demaret |title=Gene Tierney Began Her Trip Back from Madness on a Ledge 14 Floors Above the Street |magazine=People |date=7 May 1979 |accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> The fan revealed that during [[World War II]], she had sneaked out of quarantine while sick with German measles to visit the [[Hollywood Canteen]] and meet Tierney.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/tierney/about/bio.htm |title=Biography |publisher=The Official Web Site of Gene Tierney |accessdate=22 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207111220/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/tierney/about/bio.htm|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This incident, as well as the circumstances under which the information was imparted to the actress, is similar to the first pregnancy of Marina Gregg in the story.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nChristie left an interesting clue in the surname of Marina Gregg for a woman who had a child afflicted with congenital rubella syndrome. This is the same surname as Sir [[Norman Gregg]], the Australian ophthalmologist who first described cataracts in congenital rubella syndrome in 1941. Professor David Mackey mentioned this in his 2005 Gregg lecture to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists meeting.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2006.01194.x|pmid = 16671898|title = 2005 Gregg Lecture: Congenital cataract - from rubella to genetics |journal = Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology |volume = 34 |issue = 3 |pages = 199\u2013207 |year = 2006 |last1 = MacKey |first1 = David A.}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1962, Collins Crime Club (London), 12 November 1962, Hardback, 256 pp\n* 1963, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), September 1963, Hardback, 246 pp\n* 1964, [[Pocket Books]] (New York), Paperback\n* 1965, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 192 pp\n* 1966, Ulverscroft [[Large-print]] Edition, Hardcover, 255 pp\n* 1974, [[Penguin Books]], Paperback, 224 pp\n* 2006, Marple Facsimile edition (Facsimile of 1962 UK first edition), 6 March 2006, Hardcover, {{ISBN|0-00-720855-3}}\n* 2011  [[William Morrow and Company]], Trade Paperback, 288 pp, {{ISBN|978-0062073679}}\n\nThe novel was serialised in the ''Star Weekly Novel'', a Toronto newspaper supplement, in two abridged instalments from 9\u201316 March 1963 under the title ''The Mirror Crack'd'' with each issue containing a cover illustration by Gerry Sevier.\n\n==Film and television adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted for a 1980 feature film with [[Angela Lansbury]] in the role of Miss Marple. The film's co-stars were [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Marina and [[Kim Novak]] as Lola Brewster, and the cast also included [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Tony Curtis]]. The film was released as ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'', the shortened US book title. The film changed a number of elements in the novel, including Marina's surname (she uses Rudd, not Gregg), her associates, removing the character of Giuseppe, adding death threats, amongst other modifications, including shifting the setting to 1953, nine years before the book's publication.\n\nA second adaptation of the novel was made by [[BBC]] television in 1992 as part of its series ''[[Miss Marple (TV series)|Miss Marple]]'' with the title role played by [[Joan Hickson]] (in her final performance as Jane Marple), and starring [[Claire Bloom]] as Marina Gregg and [[Glynis Barber]] as Lola Brewster. The only major changes were that Giuseppe is not killed, Alfred Badcock is not a former husband of Mariana Gregg, Superintendent Slack and Sergeant Lake are written in and the character of Hailey Preston is removed. The novel was the final adaptation for the BBC series ''Miss Marple''. [[Margaret Courtenay (actress)|Margaret Courtenay]] appeared in this adaptation as Miss Knight, having previously portrayed Dolly Bantry in the 1980 feature film version.\n\n[[ITV Studios]] and [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] produced another adaptation for the ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple|Marple]]'' television series starring [[Julia McKenzie]] as Miss Marple, with [[Joanna Lumley]] reprising her role as Dolly Bantry, [[Lindsay Duncan]] as Marina Gregg and [[Hannah Waddingham]] as Lola Brewster. Investigating the murder along with Miss Marple is Inspector Hewitt, played by [[Hugh Bonneville]]. This version, while ultimately faithful to Christie's original text, included a number of notable changes.  Some of these changes were influenced by the changes that were made in the 1980 film adaptation:\n* Ella's surname is changed from Zielinsky to Blunt.  The reason for her murder was changed, mixing in elements from the 1980 film and the motive for Giuseppe's murder - Ella was attempting to blackmail the killer, but kept ringing the wrong people because she knew someone at the reception had done it, until she learned something that led her to phoning Marina and pointing out what she had done. Her love of Jason remains, but there is no affair.\n* Giuseppe is omitted from the adaptation, and there is no reference to car-man Inch selling his business within it.\n* Unlike the 1980 film adaptation, only one film is being shot in England, and that focuses on [[Nefertiti]].\n* Lola Brewster is married to one of Marina's old husbands, Vincent Hogg (added in the adaptation.) He is a journalist, who writes a couple of pieces regarding the murders and who does not have much love of Marina; she is an actress and had competed with Marina for the love of Jason, who married the latter, leaving Lola bitter about it.  Both she and Vincent attend the reception and the filming of one of Marina's scenes.\n\nFilm director and screenwriter [[Rituparno Ghosh]] created a [[Bengali language]] version of Christie's story as ''[[Shubho Mahurat]]'', which reset the story in the film industry of [[Kolkata]]. In this version, [[Sharmila Tagore]] plays the ageing star ''Padmini'', the counterpart to Christie's ''Marina Gregg''. The movie features [[Rakhi Gulzar]] in the role of the equivalent of Miss Marple.\n\n===TV Asahi ''Two Nights Drama Special'' 2018===\n[[TV Asahi]] adapted the novel in 2018 starring [[Ikki Sawamura]] and [[Hitomi Kuroki]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thetv.jp/news/detail/138537/p3/ |title=\u30a2\u30ac\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u9ed2\u6728\u77b3\u304c\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30b9\u30fb\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u6f14\u3058\u3066\u3044\u305f\u5f79\u67c4\u3092\u71b1\u6f14\uff01 |publisher=[[\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3]] |date=2018-02-24 |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>, with the title ''Two Nights Drama Special: Murder of the Great Actress \u2013 The Mirror Crack\u2019d From Side to Side'' ({{lang-ja|\u30a2\u30ac\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3 \u4e8c\u591c\u9023\u7d9a\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u5927\u5973\u512a\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff5e\u93e1\u306f\u6a2a\u306b\u3072\u3073\u5272\u308c\u3066\uff5e}})<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://dogatch.jp/news/ex/52091/detail/ |title= \u5929\u6d77\u7950\u5e0c\u3001\u6ca2\u6751\u4e00\u6a39\u306e\u4e3b\u6f14\u3067\u30a2\u30ac\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u3092\u4e8c\u591c\u9023\u7d9a\u653e\u9001 |newspaper= \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30c9\u30ac\u30c3\u30c1 |publisher= \u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 |date= 2018-02-01 |accessdate= 2019-11-13 }}</ref> as the second night, and the first night was ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]''.

She encounters Heather Badcock, who brings her to her home and relates a story of meeting American actress Marina Gregg, who has moved to England to star in a film about [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elisabeth of Austria]] and purchased Gossington Hall from Marple's friend Dolly Bantry. \n\nGregg and her latest husband, producer Jason Rudd, host a f\u00eate at Gossington Hall in honor of [[St John Ambulance (England)|St John Ambulance]]. Among the guests in attendance are Mrs Bantry, actress Lola Brewster, Gregg's personal friend Ardwyck Fenn, and Heather Badcock and her husband Arthur. All five are invited to a private room to meet Marina and have their picture taken. \n\nUpon meeting Gregg, Heather shares the story of meeting her in [[Bermuda]] and receiving her autograph, during which Mrs Bantry notices a strange look cross Gregg's face. Mrs Bantry then takes several other women to see the renovations made to the house only to be interrupted upon discovering Heather has collapsed without explanation. Despite all attempts to revive her, Heather is pronounced dead.\n\nMrs. Bantry informs Marple about the events surrounding the f\u00eate and the frozen look on Marina's face, comparing it to a phrase from [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s poem ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]''. Detective-Inspector Dermot Craddock spearheads the investigation, learning that Heather died as a result of ingesting six times the recommended dose of the tranquilizer Calmo. The drug had been slipped into a [[daiquiri]] that originally belonged to Gregg but was offered to Heather after someone jogged her arm and caused her to spill her drink. \n\nOperating on the assumption that Gregg was the intended target, Craddock proceeds to delve into her complicated past. Desperate to have a child of her own, she married several times but was unable to conceive. She then adopted three children but became pregnant and gave birth to a mentally disabled son before suffering a nervous breakdown. One of the children, Margot Bence, is revealed to have been present at Gossington Hall on the day of the f\u00eate but she denies killing Heather despite her hatred towards her adoptive mother.\n\nAs the investigation continues, two more people are killed over the course of twenty-four hours. Rudd's social secretary, Ella Zielinsky, dies first from cyanide poisoning after the [[Nebulizer|atomizer]] she uses for her hay fever is tainted with prussic acid. Later that night, Gregg's butler, Giuseppe, is shot twice in the back in his bedroom after spending the day in London and depositing \u00a3500 into his bank account. Ardwyck Fenn informs Craddock he received a phone call several days before, accusing him of killing Heather, and he recognized the anonymous caller as Ella when she sneezed.  \n\nMarple's house cleaner, Cherry Baker, reveals her friend Gladys, who was a server at Gossington Hall on the day of the f\u00eate, told her she believes Heather deliberately spilled the cocktail and that she was going to meet Giuseppe before he died. After sending Gladys on a vacation to [[Bournemouth]] and phoning the vicar, she travels to Gossington Hall only to discover Gregg died in her sleep from an overdose.\n\nWith Craddock and Rudd present, Marple reconstructs the moment when Heather recounted the story of her meeting Gregg in Bermuda, ultimately revealing that Gregg was the murderer all along. Heather, who was suffering from [[Rubella|German measles]] at the time, was indirectly responsible for Gregg's son being born disabled and for Gregg herself suffering a nervous breakdown. Overcome with rage, Gregg doctored her own daiquiri before making it so that Heather drank it. She then tried to convince everyone the poisoned drink was meant for her and killed Ella and Giuseppe after they deduced she was the killer. Marple sent Gladys away to protect her from becoming Gregg's next victim.\n\nMarple then implies Rudd administered the overdose to protect her and to prevent her from taking another life. Rudd neither confirms nor denies her suspicions, instead commenting on his wife's beauty and the suffering she endured.\n\n==Explanation of the title==\nThe title of the novel comes from the poem ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. The Lady of Shalott lives in a tower near Camelot, and sees it only reflected in a glass. She will be doomed if she looks directly; when Lancelot appears, she looks directly at him and Camelot and the looking glass cracks. This poem is referred to by name several times in the novel, with these lines quoted:\n\n:Out flew the web and floated wide-\n:The mirror crack'd from side to side;\n:\"The curse is come upon me,\" cried\n:The Lady of Shalott.\n\nAt the end, Miss Marple quotes the last three lines in referring to the dead actress:\n\n:He said, \"She has a lovely face;\n:God in his mercy lend her grace,\n:The Lady of Shalott.\"\n\n==Characters==\n*[[Miss Marple]]: Detective of St Mary Mead, recovering from an illness.\n*Mrs Cherry Baker: Young house cleaner for Miss Marple; she lives in the new development of [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] homes.\n*Jim Baker: Husband of Cherry; he does repair tasks for Miss Marple.\n*Miss Knight: Works as carer for Miss Marple, sent by Miss Marple's nephew [[Raymond West]], while she is recuperating from an illness.

And though one could accept a single coincidence concerning that married couple, the second and quite wildly improbable one tends to destroy faith in the story \u2013 still more so since it leads nowhere at all.\"<ref name=Iles1962>{{cite news |last=Iles |first=Frances |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 December 1962 |page=9 |title=Review}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMaurice Richardson of ''[[The Observer]]''  of 11 November 1962 summed up, \"A moderate Christie; bit diffuse and not so taut as some; still fairly easy to read, though.\"<ref name=Richardson1962>{{cite news |last=Richardson |first=Maurice |newspaper=The Observer |title=Review |date=11 November 1962 |page=24}}</ref>\n\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' gave a short review, noting Miss Marple's complaints about the limits imposed on her by getting old, yet nothing stops her mind from working well. The novel is summed up by this upbeat remark: \"It was her prying curiosity - her gift of putting odd bits together to form a picture that gave the locals and Scotland Yard the proper solution. Long life to her.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/agatha-christie/the-mirror-crackd-from-side-to-side/ |title=The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, Review |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |orig-year=September 1, 1963 |date= September 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]], writing in 1990, said this novel was \"The last of the true English village mysteries in Christie's output, and one of the best of her later books.

[[Congenital rubella syndrome]] was passed on to the baby. Little Daria was born prematurely, weighing only 3 pounds, 2 ounces, and requiring a total blood transfusion. The infant was deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely developmentally disabled. The child ultimately was institutionalised in a [[psychiatric hospital]].\n\nAbout two years after the child was born, Tierney was approached by a female fan for an autograph at a garden party.<ref name=Demaret1979>{{cite news |url=http://people.com/archive/gene-tierney-began-her-trip-back-from-madness-on-a-ledge-14-floors-above-the-street-vol-11-no-18/ |first=Kent |last=Demaret |title=Gene Tierney Began Her Trip Back from Madness on a Ledge 14 Floors Above the Street |magazine=People |date=7 May 1979 |accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref> The fan revealed that during [[World War II]], she had sneaked out of quarantine while sick with German measles to visit the [[Hollywood Canteen]] and meet Tierney.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/tierney/about/bio.htm |title=Biography |publisher=The Official Web Site of Gene Tierney |accessdate=22 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207111220/http://www.cmgww.com/stars/tierney/about/bio.htm|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This incident, as well as the circumstances under which the information was imparted to the actress, is similar to the first pregnancy of Marina Gregg in the story.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nChristie left an interesting clue in the surname of Marina Gregg for a woman who had a child afflicted with congenital rubella syndrome. This is the same surname as Sir [[Norman Gregg]], the Australian ophthalmologist who first described cataracts in congenital rubella syndrome in 1941. Professor David Mackey mentioned this in his 2005 Gregg lecture to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists meeting.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1442-9071.2006.01194.x|pmid = 16671898|title = 2005 Gregg Lecture: Congenital cataract - from rubella to genetics |journal = Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology |volume = 34 |issue = 3 |pages = 199\u2013207 |year = 2006 |last1 = MacKey |first1 = David A.}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1962, Collins Crime Club (London), 12 November 1962, Hardback, 256 pp\n* 1963, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), September 1963, Hardback, 246 pp\n* 1964, [[Pocket Books]] (New York), Paperback\n* 1965, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 192 pp\n* 1966, Ulverscroft [[Large-print]] Edition, Hardcover, 255 pp\n* 1974, [[Penguin Books]], Paperback, 224 pp\n* 2006, Marple Facsimile edition (Facsimile of 1962 UK first edition), 6 March 2006, Hardcover, {{ISBN|0-00-720855-3}}\n* 2011  [[William Morrow and Company]], Trade Paperback, 288 pp, {{ISBN|978-0062073679}}\n\nThe novel was serialised in the ''Star Weekly Novel'', a Toronto newspaper supplement, in two abridged instalments from 9\u201316 March 1963 under the title ''The Mirror Crack'd'' with each issue containing a cover illustration by Gerry Sevier.\n\n==Film and television adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted for a 1980 feature film with [[Angela Lansbury]] in the role of Miss Marple. The film's co-stars were [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Marina and [[Kim Novak]] as Lola Brewster, and the cast also included [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Tony Curtis]]. The film was released as ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'', the shortened US book title. The film changed a number of elements in the novel, including Marina's surname (she uses Rudd, not Gregg), her associates, removing the character of Giuseppe, adding death threats, amongst other modifications, including shifting the setting to 1953, nine years before the book's publication.\n\nA second adaptation of the novel was made by [[BBC]] television in 1992 as part of its series ''[[Miss Marple (TV series)|Miss Marple]]'' with the title role played by [[Joan Hickson]] (in her final performance as Jane Marple), and starring [[Claire Bloom]] as Marina Gregg and [[Glynis Barber]] as Lola Brewster. The only major changes were that Giuseppe is not killed, Alfred Badcock is not a former husband of Mariana Gregg, Superintendent Slack and Sergeant Lake are written in and the character of Hailey Preston is removed. The novel was the final adaptation for the BBC series ''Miss Marple''. [[Margaret Courtenay (actress)|Margaret Courtenay]] appeared in this adaptation as Miss Knight, having previously portrayed Dolly Bantry in the 1980 feature film version.\n\n[[ITV Studios]] and [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] produced another adaptation for the ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple|Marple]]'' television series starring [[Julia McKenzie]] as Miss Marple, with [[Joanna Lumley]] reprising her role as Dolly Bantry, [[Lindsay Duncan]] as Marina Gregg and [[Hannah Waddingham]] as Lola Brewster. Investigating the murder along with Miss Marple is Inspector Hewitt, played by [[Hugh Bonneville]]. This version, while ultimately faithful to Christie's original text, included a number of notable changes.  Some of these changes were influenced by the changes that were made in the 1980 film adaptation:\n* Ella's surname is changed from Zielinsky to Blunt.  The reason for her murder was changed, mixing in elements from the 1980 film and the motive for Giuseppe's murder - Ella was attempting to blackmail the killer, but kept ringing the wrong people because she knew someone at the reception had done it, until she learned something that led her to phoning Marina and pointing out what she had done. Her love of Jason remains, but there is no affair.\n* Giuseppe is omitted from the adaptation, and there is no reference to car-man Inch selling his business within it.\n* Unlike the 1980 film adaptation, only one film is being shot in England, and that focuses on [[Nefertiti]].\n* Lola Brewster is married to one of Marina's old husbands, Vincent Hogg (added in the adaptation.) He is a journalist, who writes a couple of pieces regarding the murders and who does not have much love of Marina; she is an actress and had competed with Marina for the love of Jason, who married the latter, leaving Lola bitter about it.  Both she and Vincent attend the reception and the filming of one of Marina's scenes.\n\nFilm director and screenwriter [[Rituparno Ghosh]] created a [[Bengali language]] version of Christie's story as ''[[Shubho Mahurat]]'', which reset the story in the film industry of [[Kolkata]]. In this version, [[Sharmila Tagore]] plays the ageing star ''Padmini'', the counterpart to Christie's ''Marina Gregg''. The movie features [[Rakhi Gulzar]] in the role of the equivalent of Miss Marple.\n\n===TV Asahi ''Two Nights Drama Special'' 2018===\n[[TV Asahi]] adapted the novel in 2018 starring [[Ikki Sawamura]] and [[Hitomi Kuroki]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thetv.jp/news/detail/138537/p3/ |title=\u30a2\u30ac\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u9ed2\u6728\u77b3\u304c\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30b9\u30fb\u30c6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fc\u304c\u6f14\u3058\u3066\u3044\u305f\u5f79\u67c4\u3092\u71b1\u6f14\uff01 |publisher=[[\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3]] |date=2018-02-24 |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>, with the title ''Two Nights Drama Special: Murder of the Great Actress \u2013 The Mirror Crack\u2019d From Side to Side'' ({{lang-ja|\u30a2\u30ac\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3 \u4e8c\u591c\u9023\u7d9a\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u5927\u5973\u512a\u6bba\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff5e\u93e1\u306f\u6a2a\u306b\u3072\u3073\u5272\u308c\u3066\uff5e}})<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://dogatch.jp/news/ex/52091/detail/ |title= \u5929\u6d77\u7950\u5e0c\u3001\u6ca2\u6751\u4e00\u6a39\u306e\u4e3b\u6f14\u3067\u30a2\u30ac\u30b5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u540d\u4f5c\u3092\u4e8c\u591c\u9023\u7d9a\u653e\u9001 |newspaper= \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30c9\u30ac\u30c3\u30c1 |publisher= \u30d7\u30ec\u30bc\u30f3\u30c8\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 |date= 2018-02-01 |accessdate= 2019-11-13 }}</ref> as the second night, and the first night was ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]''.
