At the age of 19, she left home to seek work in [[Plymouth]], England, where she became involved in crime. She, along with Catherine Fryer and Mary Hayden alias Shepherd, robbed and violently assaulted Agnes Lakeman on a road in Plymouth, stealing a silk bonnet valued at 12 pence, and other goods valued at \u00a31 and 11 shillings. All three were sentenced to hang on 20 March 1786, which was commuted to seven years' transportation during the following month.\n\n==Transportation==\nIn May 1787, Bryant was sent as a prisoner with the [[First Fleet]] aboard the ship ''[[Charlotte (1784 ship)|Charlotte]]''. Bryant gave birth on the journey to a baby, whom she called Charlotte. When she arrived in Australia, she married [[William Bryant (convict)|William Bryant]] on 10 February 1788. Bryant, a convicted smuggler, was also on the ''Charlotte'' with Mary and they later had a son, Emanuel, born on 6 May 1790.\n\nWilliam Bryant was also from Cornwall, where he had worked as a fisherman. In early [[New South Wales]], William was considered useful, and was put in charge of looking after the fishing ships. When he was caught selling fish on the side, he was given 100 lashes. He made a plan to escape with Mary, persuading a Dutch captain to give him some sailing equipment, and waited until all boats that could chase after them had left.\n\n==Escape from the colony and recapture==\nOn 28 March 1791, William and Mary Bryant, the children, and fellow prisoners William Allen, [[James Martin (convict)|James Martin]], Samuel Bird alias John Simms, Samuel Broom alias John Butcher, James Cox alias Rolt, Nathaniel Lillie, and William Morton (an experienced navigator), stole Governor Arthur Phillip's six-oared cutter.<ref name=\"Causer and Martin\">{{cite book |title=Memorandoms |author=James Martin |editor=Causer, Tim |year=2014 |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/Bentham-Project/publications/martins-memorandoms/martins-memorandoms.html |publisher=Rampant Lions Press |accessdate=15 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116145050/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/Bentham-Project/publications/martins-memorandoms/martins-memorandoms.html |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After a voyage of sixty-six days, the group reached [[Kupang]], in [[West Timor]] on the island of [[Timor]], a journey of 5,000 kilometres.

In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. They wed in defiance of Tsar [[Nicholas II]] prohibition. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honors, also initially banishing the couple from Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas II recognized their marriage. During [[World War I]], Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy.

With the murder of his cousins Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today.

In 1913, he joined the Maritime Division of the Imperial Guard and was made Commander of the Naval Guards in 1915.\n\nGrand Duke Kirill and Princess Victoria Melita had three children:\n*[[Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia]] (2 February 1907 \u2013 27 October 1951) who married  Friedrich Karl, Prince of Leiningen\n*[[Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia]] (9 May 1909 \u2013 8 September 1967) who married [[Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia]]\n*[[Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia]] (30 August 1917 \u2013 21 April 1992) who became the claimant to the title ''Emperor of Russia'' upon the death of his father\n\nAll the children were born to the rank of Prince and Princess of Russia, not entitled to the rank of Grand Duke or Grand Duchess as they were not children or grandchildren in the male line of a Russian Emperor according to the Imperial Family Statutes that became law under Tsar Alexander III. In accordance with Imperial statutes, Kirill raised his children to the rank of Grand Duke and Grand Duchess after assuming the position of senior male of the Romanov family, and Head of the Imperial House. This elevation was openly denounced by Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich when he published a private letter of the Dowager Empress in 1924 in which she stated that Kirill's assumption of the position was \"premature.\"  The Dowager Empress believed that her sons and grandsons might still be alive in Russia.  Grand Duke Kirill wrote to [[Grand Duchess Xenia]] \"Nothing can be compared to what I shall now have to endure on this account, and I know full well I can expect no mercy from all the malicious attacks and accusations of vanity.\"<ref>Romanov, Kirill V. \"My Life in Russia's Service,\" London: Seleyn & Blount, 1939., p.222.</ref>\n\n==Revolution==\nDuring the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Kirill marched to the [[Tauride Palace]] at the head of the ''Garde Equipage'' (Marine Guard) to swear allegiance to the [[Russian Provisional Government]], wearing a red band on his uniform.<ref name=Cyril/><ref>{{cite news|title=Duke Cyril Prompt To Side With Duma|newspaper=New York Times|page=2|date=17 March 1917}}</ref> Kirill had authorised the flying of a red flag over his palace on Glinka Street in Petrograd and in correspondence with a Romanov relative claimed credit for \"saving the situation by my recognition of the Provisional Government\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Massie, Robert|page=433|title=Nicholas and Alexandra|isbn=033002213X}}</ref> It is probable that he had hoped that by ingratiating himself with the Provisional Government he would be declared [[regent]] after Nicholas II was made to abdicate.<ref>Crawford, Rosemary and Donald ''Michael and Natasha: The Life and Love of the Last Tsar of Russia''  Weidenfeld & Nicolson (1997) p.276.</ref>\n\nIn June 1917 Kirill and Victoria moved to [[Finland]] and then escaped to [[Coburg, Germany]] in 1920. The exiled family subsequently moved to a small residence in the tiny French fishing village of St. Briac.\n\n==Life abroad==\nAfter a London court order in July 1924 recognized Grand Duke Michael to be [[legally dead]], Kirill first declared himself \"Guardian of the Throne\" on 8 August 1924 and then on 31 August 1924 he assumed the title ''Emperor of all the Russias''.<ref name=adg/> By the laws of the [[Russian Empire]] he was the heir to the throne. However, his claim caused division within the family; his principal rival, and the only one to reject his claim was [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]]. In 1926 at a (Russian) monarchists congress in Paris the delegates voted to recognize Grand Duke Nicholas as their leader; however, with Nicholas's death in 1929 Kirill became the undisputed leader of the monarchists.<ref>Shain, Yossi ''The Frontier of Loyalty: Political Exiles in the Age of the Nation-State'' University of Michigan Press (2005) p.69.</ref>\n\nAfter claiming the throne, Kirill became known as the \"Soviet Tsar\" because in the event of a restoration of the monarchy, he intended to keep some of the features of the Soviet regime.<ref name=Cyril/> While living in exile, he was supported by some emigres who styled themselves \"legitimists\" (''legitimisti'', in Russian \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b), underlining the \"legitimacy\" of Kirill's succession. The opponents of Kirill were known as the \"un-predetermined\" (''nepredreshentsi'', in Russian \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0446\u044b); they believed that in the wake of the radical revolutionary events that the convening of a ''[[Zemsky Sobor]]'' was necessary in order to choose a new monarch for Russia.\n\nKirill found his strongest support among a group of legitimists known as the [[Mladorossi]], a Russian emigre monarchist organization that ultimately became heavily influenced by [[fascism]] \u2013 although it distanced itself from other fascist movements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/allnews-en/articles/4311.html|title=This era of globalization is also an era of monarchs as symbols\u201d: An Interview with the Director of the Chancellery of the Russian Imperial House, A.

He took part in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], barely surviving the sinking of the [[battleship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1894|2}} at [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]] in April 1904. In 1905, he married his paternal first cousin, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. They wed in defiance of Tsar [[Nicholas II]] prohibition. In retaliation, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honors, also initially banishing the couple from Russia. They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909. In 1910 they moved to Russia, where Nicholas II recognized their marriage. During [[World War I]], Grand Duke Kirill was appointed Commander of the Naval Depot of the Guards in 1915 and in 1916, he achieved the rank of rear Admiral in the Imperial Navy. During the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Kirill marched to the [[Tauride Palace]] at the head of the Naval Guards swearing allegiance to the [[Russian Provisional Government]].  \n\nDuring the rule of the provisional governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to [[Finland]] where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in [[Saint-Briac-sur-Mer|Saint-Briac]]. With the murder of his cousins Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, as next in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile for the rest of his life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that continues until today. He wrote a book of memoirs, ''My Life in Russia's Service'', published after his death. His granddaughter, [[Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna]], is the current claimant to the headship of the [[House of Romanov]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Grand Dukes Andrei, Kirill and Boris Vladimirovich in their childhood.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Kirill (centre) with his brothers Andrei (left) and Boris (right)]]\n\nGrand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia was born on {{OldStyleDate|12 October|1876|30 September}} in Tsarskoye Selo, at his parents' country residence, the Vladimir Villa.<ref name=\"Korneva & Cheboksarova 53\">Korneva & Cheboksarova, ''Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna'', p. 53.</ref> His father was [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]], the third son of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II of Russia]].

Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna was also appalled at the effrontery of Kirill's marriage. Shortly after Kirill's return to Russia, the Tsar stripped Kirill of his imperial allowance and title of Imperial Highness, his [[military awards and decorations|honours and decorations]], his position in the navy and then banished him from Russia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Czar Furious With Cousin|newspaper=New York Times|page=6|date=15 October 1905}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Grand Duke Degraded|newspaper=The New York Times|page=1|date=17 October 1905}}</ref> Kirill's marriage was in open defiance of the Russian Orthodox Church ruling that first cousins were not permitted to marry. Kirill knew that the Tsar's brother [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich]] had been forbidden to marry his first cousin, [[Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh |Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]].\n\nIn 1908, after the death of [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich]] had put Kirill third in the line of succession to the Imperial Throne, Nicholas II restored Kirill to his rank of Captain in the Imperial Russian Navy and his position as aide de camp to the emperor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Death Wins Pardon For A Grand Duke|newspaper=The New York Times|page=6|date=19 November 1908}}</ref> He was given the title Grand Duke of Russia and from then on his wife was styled as ''Her Imperial Highness'' Grand Duchess Viktoria Feodorovna. From 1909\u20131912, Kirill served on the cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Oleg||2}} and was its captain in 1912. In 1913, he joined the Maritime Division of the Imperial Guard and was made Commander of the Naval Guards in 1915.\n\nGrand Duke Kirill and Princess Victoria Melita had three children:\n*[[Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia]] (2 February 1907 \u2013 27 October 1951) who married  Friedrich Karl, Prince of Leiningen\n*[[Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna of Russia]] (9 May 1909 \u2013 8 September 1967) who married [[Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia]]\n*[[Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia]] (30 August 1917 \u2013 21 April 1992) who became the claimant to the title ''Emperor of Russia'' upon the death of his father\n\nAll the children were born to the rank of Prince and Princess of Russia, not entitled to the rank of Grand Duke or Grand Duchess as they were not children or grandchildren in the male line of a Russian Emperor according to the Imperial Family Statutes that became law under Tsar Alexander III. In accordance with Imperial statutes, Kirill raised his children to the rank of Grand Duke and Grand Duchess after assuming the position of senior male of the Romanov family, and Head of the Imperial House. This elevation was openly denounced by Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich when he published a private letter of the Dowager Empress in 1924 in which she stated that Kirill's assumption of the position was \"premature.\"  The Dowager Empress believed that her sons and grandsons might still be alive in Russia.  Grand Duke Kirill wrote to [[Grand Duchess Xenia]] \"Nothing can be compared to what I shall now have to endure on this account, and I know full well I can expect no mercy from all the malicious attacks and accusations of vanity.\"<ref>Romanov, Kirill V. \"My Life in Russia's Service,\" London: Seleyn & Blount, 1939., p.222.</ref>\n\n==Revolution==\nDuring the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Kirill marched to the [[Tauride Palace]] at the head of the ''Garde Equipage'' (Marine Guard) to swear allegiance to the [[Russian Provisional Government]], wearing a red band on his uniform.<ref name=Cyril/><ref>{{cite news|title=Duke Cyril Prompt To Side With Duma|newspaper=New York Times|page=2|date=17 March 1917}}</ref> Kirill had authorised the flying of a red flag over his palace on Glinka Street in Petrograd and in correspondence with a Romanov relative claimed credit for \"saving the situation by my recognition of the Provisional Government\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Massie, Robert|page=433|title=Nicholas and Alexandra|isbn=033002213X}}</ref> It is probable that he had hoped that by ingratiating himself with the Provisional Government he would be declared [[regent]] after Nicholas II was made to abdicate.<ref>Crawford, Rosemary and Donald ''Michael and Natasha: The Life and Love of the Last Tsar of Russia''  Weidenfeld & Nicolson (1997) p.276.</ref>\n\nIn June 1917 Kirill and Victoria moved to [[Finland]] and then escaped to [[Coburg, Germany]] in 1920. The exiled family subsequently moved to a small residence in the tiny French fishing village of St. Briac.\n\n==Life abroad==\nAfter a London court order in July 1924 recognized Grand Duke Michael to be [[legally dead]], Kirill first declared himself \"Guardian of the Throne\" on 8 August 1924 and then on 31 August 1924 he assumed the title ''Emperor of all the Russias''.<ref name=adg/> By the laws of the [[Russian Empire]] he was the heir to the throne. However, his claim caused division within the family; his principal rival, and the only one to reject his claim was [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]]. In 1926 at a (Russian) monarchists congress in Paris the delegates voted to recognize Grand Duke Nicholas as their leader; however, with Nicholas's death in 1929 Kirill became the undisputed leader of the monarchists.<ref>Shain, Yossi ''The Frontier of Loyalty: Political Exiles in the Age of the Nation-State'' University of Michigan Press (2005) p.69.</ref>\n\nAfter claiming the throne, Kirill became known as the \"Soviet Tsar\" because in the event of a restoration of the monarchy, he intended to keep some of the features of the Soviet regime.<ref name=Cyril/> While living in exile, he was supported by some emigres who styled themselves \"legitimists\" (''legitimisti'', in Russian \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b), underlining the \"legitimacy\" of Kirill's succession. The opponents of Kirill were known as the \"un-predetermined\" (''nepredreshentsi'', in Russian \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0446\u044b); they believed that in the wake of the radical revolutionary events that the convening of a ''[[Zemsky Sobor]]'' was necessary in order to choose a new monarch for Russia.\n\nKirill found his strongest support among a group of legitimists known as the [[Mladorossi]], a Russian emigre monarchist organization that ultimately became heavily influenced by [[fascism]] \u2013 although it distanced itself from other fascist movements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/allnews-en/articles/4311.html|title=This era of globalization is also an era of monarchs as symbols\u201d: An Interview with the Director of the Chancellery of the Russian Imperial House, A.

Kirill became more wary of the organization when he learned that its founder, [[Alexander Lvovich Kazembek|Alexander Kazem-Bek]], was spotted meeting with an [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]] agent.

The contest's winner has been determined using numerous [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|voting techniques]] throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or [[televoting|televoters]].

The country with the highest number of wins is [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland]], with seven. The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland's [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]], who performed \"[[What's Another Year]]\" in 1980 and \"[[Hold Me Now (Johnny Logan song)|Hold Me Now]]\" in 1987.

Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his/her credit, as either singer, songwriter or both. The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are, [[Willy van Hemert]] (Netherlands, 1957 and 1959), Yves Dessca (Monaco, 1971 and Luxembourg, 1972), [[Rolf L\u00f8vland]] (Norway, 1985 and 1995) and [[Brendan Graham]] (Ireland, 1994 and 1996).\n\nWinning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career during their singing years. However, throughout the history of the contest, relatively few of these artists have gone on to be huge international stars. The most notable winning Eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were the members of [[ABBA]], who won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 contest]] for Sweden with their song \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\". ABBA went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time.<ref>[[BBC News]] (6 December 2005). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4502670.stm ABBA's Bjorn says no to reunion].

BBC News (23 October 2005). Retrieved on 22 August 2007.</ref>\n\n[[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland]] has finished first seven times, more than any other country, Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years (1992, 1993, 1994), more consecutive years than any other country. Three countries have won twice in a row, [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] (1968 and 1969), [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]] (1972 and 1973) and [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]] (1978 and 1979). [[Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia]] is the only country to win with its debut entry (in 2007), though Serbia had competed previously as part of [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]]. The country achieving the highest position on its first appearance in any form in the Contest is Poland, which came second in 1994 (even Switzerland in 1956 won with its second entry of the night). Under the voting system used between 1975 and 2015, the winner of the contest was decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions.<ref group=\"N\">1979, 1980, 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1998, 2002 and 2003.</ref>\n\nChanges to the voting system, including a steady growth in the number of countries participating and voting, means that the points earned are not comparable across the decades. Portugal's [[Salvador Sobral]] holds the record of the highest number of points in the contest's history, earning 758 with the song \"[[Amar pelos dois]]\".  Norway's [[Alexander Rybak]] holds the largest margin of victory in absolute points, a 169-point cushion over second place in 2009. Italy's [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] holds the record for largest victory by percentage, scoring almost three times as many as second place (49 points compared with 17 by the runner-up) in the 1964 contest. Under the voting system used from 1975 until 2015, the lowest winning score was Norway's [[Bobbysocks!]] 123 points earned (of the 216 available from the 18 other countries) when winning [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|Eurovision 1985]], while the lowest winning total ever is the 18 points (of the 160 total votes cast by 16 countries) scored by each of the four winning countries in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]].\n\nUnder the voting system used from 1975 until 2015, in which each country gives maximum points to its first place choice, Sweden's [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]] won [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Eurovision 2012]] with the most ever first place votes earned, receiving first place votes from 18 of 41 countries (excluding themselves).  The 1976 United Kingdom entrant, Brotherhood of Man with the song \"Save Your Kisses For Me\" holds the record of the highest average score per participating country, with an average of 9.65 points received per country. [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] winner Azerbaijan [[Ell & Nikki]], hold the lowest average score for a winning song under that system, receiving 5.14 points per country.\n\nIn 2016, Jamala's \"1944\" became the first winning entry since the jury vote was added alongside the televote starting in 2009 to place first in neither area, coming second in the jury vote behind Australia and second in the televote behind Russia. Duncan Laurence's \"Arcade,\" became the second such winner in the 2019 contest, having placed third behind Sweden and North Macedonia in the jury vote and second behind Norway in the televote.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] has finished second fifteen times at Eurovision (most recently in 1998), more than any other country. The most successful country never to have won the Contest is Malta, having finished second in 2002 and 2005 and third in 1992 and 1998. Another island nation Iceland has also finished second twice, in 1999 and 2009.\n\nThere is no official runner-up for two of the contests \u2013 1956 and 1969. In 1956 only the winner, Switzerland, was announced, whilst there were speculative reports that Germany ended up in second place with \"[[Im Wartesaal zum gro\u00dfen Gl\u00fcck]]\" by [[Walter Andreas Schwarz]], given that Germany was chosen to host the 1957 contest.  In 1969 four songs shared first place by achieving the same number of points; fifth place was achieved by Switzerland, which is not considered an official runner-up, because of the draw for first place.\n\n== Winners by country ==\n[[File:Eurovision winners map.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing each country's number of Eurovision wins up to and including 2019.<ref group=\"N\">Yugoslavia's 1989 victory is shown in the lower inset.</ref>]]\n;Table key\n{{legend|#F88379|Former countries that have been dissolved.|text={{dagger}}}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!Wins\n!Country\n!Years\n|-\n| 7\n|{{Esc|Ireland}}\n|{{escyr|1970}}, {{escyr|1980}}, {{escyr|1987}}, {{escyr|1992}}, {{escyr|1993}}, {{escyr|1994}}, {{escyr|1996}}\n|-\n| 6\n|{{Esc|Sweden}}\n|{{escyr|1974}}, {{escyr|1984}}, {{escyr|1991}}, {{escyr|1999}}, {{escyr|2012}}, {{escyr|2015}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 5\n|{{Esc|France}}\n|{{escyr|1958}}, {{escyr|1960}}, {{escyr|1962}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}'', {{escyr|1977}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Luxembourg}}\n|{{escyr|1961}}, {{escyr|1965}}, {{escyr|1972}}, {{escyr|1973}}, {{escyr|1983}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|United Kingdom}}\n|{{escyr|1967}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}'', {{escyr|1976}}, {{escyr|1981}}, {{escyr|1997}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Netherlands}}\n|{{escyr|1957}}, {{escyr|1959}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}'', {{escyr|1975}}, {{escyr|2019}}\n|-\n|4\n|{{Esc|Israel}}\n|{{escyr|1978}}, {{escyr|1979}},  {{escyr|1998}}, {{escyr|2018}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 3\n|{{Esc|Norway}}\n|{{escyr|1985}}, {{escyr|1995}}, {{escyr|2009}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Denmark}}\n|{{escyr|1963}}, {{escyr|2000}}, {{escyr|2013}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"| 2\n|{{Esc|Spain}}\n|{{escyr|1968}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}''\n|-\n|{{Esc|Switzerland}}\n|{{escyr|1956}}, {{escyr|1988}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Italy}}\n|{{escyr|1964}}, {{escyr|1990}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Germany}}\n|{{escyr|1982}}, {{escyr|2010}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Austria}}\n|{{escyr|1966}}, {{escyr|2014}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Ukraine}}\n|{{escyr|2004}}, {{escyr|2016}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"13\" | 1\n|{{Esc|Monaco}}\n|{{escyr|1971}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Belgium}}\n|{{escyr|1986}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"F88379\"|{{Esc|Yugoslavia}} {{dagger}}\n|bgcolor=\"F88379\"|{{escyr|1989}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Estonia}}\n|{{escyr|2001}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Latvia}}\n|{{escyr|2002}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Turkey}}\n|{{escyr|2003}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Greece}}\n|{{escyr|2005}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Finland}}\n|{{escyr|2006}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Serbia}}\n|{{escyr|2007}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Russia}}\n|{{escyr|2008}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Azerbaijan}}\n|{{escyr|2011}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Portugal}}\n|{{escyr|2017}}\n|}\nYear 1969 is in ''italics'' to indicate a joint (4-way) win\n\n== By language ==\n{{Pie chart\n| thumb = right\n| caption =\n| other =\n| label1 = English\n| value1 = 46.42 | color1 = #50B432\n| label2 = French\n| value2 = 20.32 | color2 = #ED561B\n| label3 = Hebrew\n| value3 = 5.82 | color3 = #24CBE5\n| label4 = Dutch\n| value4 = 4.32 | color4 = #DDDF00\n| label5 = German\n| value5 = 2.92 | color5 = #64E572\n| label6 = Norwegian\n| value6 = 2.92 | color6 = #FF9655\n| label7 = Swedish\n| value7 = 2.92 | color7 = #FFF263\n| label8 = Italian\n| value8 = 2.92 | color8 = #6AF9C4\n| label9 = Spanish\n| value9 = 2.92 | color9 = #2F7ED8\n| label10 = Danish\n| value10 = 1.42 | color10 =#0D233A\n| label11 = Ukrainian\n| value11 = 1.42 | color11 =#8BBC21\n| label12 = Croatian\n| value12 = 1.42 | color12 =#910000\n| label13 = Serbian\n| value13 = 1.42 | color13 =#1AADCE\n| label14 = Crimean Tatar\n| value14 = 1.42 | color14 =#f1c40f\n| label15 = Portuguese\n| value15 = 1.42 | color15 =#154eb7\n}}\nBetween 1966 and 1973, and again between 1977 and 1998, countries were only permitted to perform in their own language;

Twenty-seven countries have won the contest. [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Switzerland]] won the first contest in 1956. The country with the highest number of wins is [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland]], with seven. The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland's [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]], who performed \"[[What's Another Year]]\" in 1980 and \"[[Hold Me Now (Johnny Logan song)|Hold Me Now]]\" in 1987. Logan is also one of only five songwriters to have written more than one winning entry (\"[[Hold Me Now (Johnny Logan song)|Hold Me Now]]\" 1987 and \"[[Why Me? (Linda Martin song)|Why Me?]]\" 1992, performed by [[Linda Martin]]).<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his/her credit, as either singer, songwriter or both. The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are, [[Willy van Hemert]] (Netherlands, 1957 and 1959), Yves Dessca (Monaco, 1971 and Luxembourg, 1972), [[Rolf L\u00f8vland]] (Norway, 1985 and 1995) and [[Brendan Graham]] (Ireland, 1994 and 1996).\n\nWinning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career during their singing years. However, throughout the history of the contest, relatively few of these artists have gone on to be huge international stars. The most notable winning Eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were the members of [[ABBA]], who won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 contest]] for Sweden with their song \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\". ABBA went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time.<ref>[[BBC News]] (6 December 2005). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4502670.stm ABBA's Bjorn says no to reunion]. Retrieved on 15 March 2008.</ref> Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame and success was [[C\u00e9line Dion]], who won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 contest]] for Switzerland with the song \"[[Ne partez pas sans moi]]\".\n\nSince 2008, the winner has been awarded an official winner's trophy of the Eurovision Song Contest. The trophy is a handmade piece of sandblasted glass in the shape of a 1950s [[microphone]].<ref name=\"Trophy\">{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/trophy/|title=Trophy|website=Eurovision Song Contest|language=en|access-date=31 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kostaboda.co.uk/eurovision-song-contest/|title=Eurovision Crystal Trophy|website=[[Kosta Glasbruk|Kosta Boda]]|language=en|access-date=31 May 2019}}</ref> The song writers and composers of the winning entry receive smaller versions of the trophy.<ref name=\"Trophy\" /> The original design was created by Kjell Engman of [[Kosta Glasbruk|Kosta Boda]], who specialises in glass art.<ref name=\"Trophy\" />\n\n== Winners by year ==\n{{see also|List of Eurovision Song Contest winning songwriters}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!

BBC News (23 October 2005). Retrieved on 22 August 2007.</ref>\n\n[[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland]] has finished first seven times, more than any other country, Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years (1992, 1993, 1994), more consecutive years than any other country. Three countries have won twice in a row, [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] (1968 and 1969), [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]] (1972 and 1973) and [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]] (1978 and 1979). [[Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia]] is the only country to win with its debut entry (in 2007), though Serbia had competed previously as part of [[Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia]] and [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]]. The country achieving the highest position on its first appearance in any form in the Contest is Poland, which came second in 1994 (even Switzerland in 1956 won with its second entry of the night). Under the voting system used between 1975 and 2015, the winner of the contest was decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions.<ref group=\"N\">1979, 1980, 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1993, 1998, 2002 and 2003.</ref>\n\nChanges to the voting system, including a steady growth in the number of countries participating and voting, means that the points earned are not comparable across the decades. Portugal's [[Salvador Sobral]] holds the record of the highest number of points in the contest's history, earning 758 with the song \"[[Amar pelos dois]]\".  Norway's [[Alexander Rybak]] holds the largest margin of victory in absolute points, a 169-point cushion over second place in 2009. Italy's [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] holds the record for largest victory by percentage, scoring almost three times as many as second place (49 points compared with 17 by the runner-up) in the 1964 contest. Under the voting system used from 1975 until 2015, the lowest winning score was Norway's [[Bobbysocks!]] 123 points earned (of the 216 available from the 18 other countries) when winning [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|Eurovision 1985]], while the lowest winning total ever is the 18 points (of the 160 total votes cast by 16 countries) scored by each of the four winning countries in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969]].\n\nUnder the voting system used from 1975 until 2015, in which each country gives maximum points to its first place choice, Sweden's [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]] won [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Eurovision 2012]] with the most ever first place votes earned, receiving first place votes from 18 of 41 countries (excluding themselves).  The 1976 United Kingdom entrant, Brotherhood of Man with the song \"Save Your Kisses For Me\" holds the record of the highest average score per participating country, with an average of 9.65 points received per country. [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] winner Azerbaijan [[Ell & Nikki]], hold the lowest average score for a winning song under that system, receiving 5.14 points per country.\n\nIn 2016, Jamala's \"1944\" became the first winning entry since the jury vote was added alongside the televote starting in 2009 to place first in neither area, coming second in the jury vote behind Australia and second in the televote behind Russia. Duncan Laurence's \"Arcade,\" became the second such winner in the 2019 contest, having placed third behind Sweden and North Macedonia in the jury vote and second behind Norway in the televote.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] has finished second fifteen times at Eurovision (most recently in 1998), more than any other country. The most successful country never to have won the Contest is Malta, having finished second in 2002 and 2005 and third in 1992 and 1998. Another island nation Iceland has also finished second twice, in 1999 and 2009.\n\nThere is no official runner-up for two of the contests \u2013 1956 and 1969. In 1956 only the winner, Switzerland, was announced, whilst there were speculative reports that Germany ended up in second place with \"[[Im Wartesaal zum gro\u00dfen Gl\u00fcck]]\" by [[Walter Andreas Schwarz]], given that Germany was chosen to host the 1957 contest.  In 1969 four songs shared first place by achieving the same number of points; fifth place was achieved by Switzerland, which is not considered an official runner-up, because of the draw for first place.\n\n== Winners by country ==\n[[File:Eurovision winners map.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing each country's number of Eurovision wins up to and including 2019.<ref group=\"N\">Yugoslavia's 1989 victory is shown in the lower inset.</ref>]]\n;Table key\n{{legend|#F88379|Former countries that have been dissolved.}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!Wins\n!Country\n!Years\n|-\n| 7\n|{{Esc|Ireland}}\n|{{escyr|1970}}, {{escyr|1980}}, {{escyr|1987}}, {{escyr|1992}}, {{escyr|1993}}, {{escyr|1994}}, {{escyr|1996}}\n|-\n| 6\n|{{Esc|Sweden}}\n|{{escyr|1974}}, {{escyr|1984}}, {{escyr|1991}}, {{escyr|1999}}, {{escyr|2012}}, {{escyr|2015}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 5\n|{{Esc|France}}\n|{{escyr|1958}}, {{escyr|1960}}, {{escyr|1962}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}'', {{escyr|1977}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Luxembourg}}\n|{{escyr|1961}}, {{escyr|1965}}, {{escyr|1972}}, {{escyr|1973}}, {{escyr|1983}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|United Kingdom}}\n|{{escyr|1967}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}'', {{escyr|1976}}, {{escyr|1981}}, {{escyr|1997}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Netherlands}}\n|{{escyr|1957}}, {{escyr|1959}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}'', {{escyr|1975}}, {{escyr|2019}}\n|-\n|4\n|{{Esc|Israel}}\n|{{escyr|1978}}, {{escyr|1979}},  {{escyr|1998}}, {{escyr|2018}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 3\n|{{Esc|Norway}}\n|{{escyr|1985}}, {{escyr|1995}}, {{escyr|2009}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Denmark}}\n|{{escyr|1963}}, {{escyr|2000}}, {{escyr|2013}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"| 2\n|{{Esc|Spain}}\n|{{escyr|1968}}, ''{{escyr|1969}}''\n|-\n|{{Esc|Switzerland}}\n|{{escyr|1956}}, {{escyr|1988}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Italy}}\n|{{escyr|1964}}, {{escyr|1990}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Germany}}\n|{{escyr|1982}}, {{escyr|2010}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Austria}}\n|{{escyr|1966}}, {{escyr|2014}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Ukraine}}\n|{{escyr|2004}}, {{escyr|2016}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"13\" | 1\n|{{Esc|Monaco}}\n|{{escyr|1971}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Belgium}}\n|{{escyr|1986}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"F88379\"|{{Esc|Yugoslavia}}\n|bgcolor=\"F88379\"|{{escyr|1989}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Estonia}}\n|{{escyr|2001}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Latvia}}\n|{{escyr|2002}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Turkey}}\n|{{escyr|2003}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Greece}}\n|{{escyr|2005}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Finland}}\n|{{escyr|2006}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Serbia}}\n|{{escyr|2007}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Russia}}\n|{{escyr|2008}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Azerbaijan}}\n|{{escyr|2011}}\n|-\n|{{Esc|Portugal}}\n|{{escyr|2017}}\n|}\nYear 1969 is in ''italics'' to indicate a joint (4-way) win\n\n== By language ==\n{{Pie chart\n| thumb = right\n| caption =\n| other =\n| label1 = English\n| value1 = 46.42 | color1 = #50B432\n| label2 = French\n| value2 = 20.32 | color2 = #ED561B\n| label3 = Hebrew\n| value3 = 5.82 | color3 = #24CBE5\n| label4 = Dutch\n| value4 = 4.32 | color4 = #DDDF00\n| label5 = German\n| value5 = 2.92 | color5 = #64E572\n| label6 = Norwegian\n| value6 = 2.92 | color6 = #FF9655\n| label7 = Swedish\n| value7 = 2.92 | color7 = #FFF263\n| label8 = Italian\n| value8 = 2.92 | color8 = #6AF9C4\n| label9 = Spanish\n| value9 = 2.92 | color9 = #2F7ED8\n| label10 = Danish\n| value10 = 1.42 | color10 =#0D233A\n| label11 = Ukrainian\n| value11 = 1.42 | color11 =#8BBC21\n| label12 = Croatian\n| value12 = 1.42 | color12 =#910000\n| label13 = Serbian\n| value13 = 1.42 | color13 =#1AADCE\n| label14 = Crimean Tatar\n| value14 = 1.42 | color14 =#f1c40f\n| label15 = Portuguese\n| value15 = 1.42 | color15 =#154eb7\n}}\nBetween 1966 and 1973, and again between 1977 and 1998, countries were only permitted to perform in their own language;

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n\nClocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''clock'' derives from the medieval [[Latin]] word for \"bell\"; ''clogga'', and has [[cognate]]s in many European languages.

Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main|Water clock}}\n[[File:MandalayWaterClock.jpg|thumb|upright|A water clock for [[goldbeating]] [[goldleaf]] in [[Mandalay]] ([[Myanmar]]).]]\n\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable.

Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/clocks.html|title=Clocks{{Snd}} Crystalinks|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'.

Some of the more basic table clocks have only one time-keeping hand, with the dial between the hour markers being divided into four equal parts making the clocks readable to the nearest 15 minutes. Other clocks were exhibitions of craftsmanship and skill, incorporating astronomical indicators and musical movements. The [[escapement#Cross-beat escapement|cross-beat escapement]] was invented in 1584 by [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], who also developed the [[remontoire]].

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17th century. [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor. He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time (about 99.4&nbsp;cm or 39.1&nbsp;inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum-driven clock made. The first model clock was built in 1657 in [[the Hague]], but it was in [[England]] that the idea was taken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&HistoryID=ac08&gtrack=pthc|title=History of Clocks}}</ref> The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the ''grandfather clock'') was created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671.

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671.

This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his [[pocket watch]]es, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Of Clocks|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&HistoryID=ac08&gtrack=pthc}}</ref> The rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, was introduced during the 17th century and had distinct advantages over the 'countwheel' (or 'locking plate') mechanism. During the 20th century there was a common misconception that [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented ''[[rack and snail]]'' striking. In fact, his invention was connected with a repeating mechanism employing the rack and snail.<ref>Horological Journal, September 2011, pp. 408\u2013412.</ref> The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) on demand was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676.

The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks, later received considerable sums under the Longitude Act.\n\nIn 1735, Harrison built his first [[marine chronometer|chronometer]], which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display. Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz===\n[[File:Inside QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg|thumb|Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\n[[File:Split-flap clock.jpg|thumb|This clock used the 60&nbsp;Hz of electrical power, and features a split-flap physical for displaying the time numbers]]\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or \"beat\" dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47\u201350]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3-527-40230-4|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\n[[Image:Greenwich clock 1-manipulated.jpg|thumb|Shepherd Gate Clock received its timing signal from within the observatory]]\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, pp. 325\u2013328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52\u201362]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a dial with the numbers 1 through 12 or 24, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes one or two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>{{US Patent|7079452}}, {{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n\n====Digital====\n{{main|Digital clock}}\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It's about three o'clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f|first=t|p=s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng}}) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u9001\u7d42}}|s={{linktext|\u9001\u7ec8}}|first=t|p={{linktext|s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng}}}}).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233649/http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 |date=January 5, 2018 }} \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]].

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n\nClocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''clock'' derives from the medieval [[Latin]] word for \"bell\"; ''clogga'', and has [[cognate]]s in many European languages.

Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main|Water clock}}\n[[File:MandalayWaterClock.jpg|thumb|upright|A water clock for [[goldbeating]] [[goldleaf]] in [[Mandalay]] ([[Myanmar]]).]]\n\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable.

Other regions of the world, including [[India]] and [[China]], also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, write about water clocks appearing as early as 4000 BC in these regions of the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century B.C.<ref>[http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/tower-of-winds-1.html Tower of the Winds \u2013 Athens]</ref> The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations advanced water clock design with improved accuracy. These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/clocks.html|title=Clocks{{Snd}} Crystalinks|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'. Over the next 30 years there are mentions of clocks at a number of ecclesiastical institutions in England, Italy, and France. In 1322, a [[Norwich cathedral astronomical clock|new clock was installed in Norwich]], an expensive replacement for an earlier clock installed in 1273. This had a large (2 metre) astronomical dial with automata and bells. The costs of the installation included the full-time employment of two [[clockkeeper]]s for two years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Astronomical===\n[[File:Abbot Richard Wallingford.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard of Wallingford]] pointing to a clock, his gift to [[St Albans Abbey]].]]\n[[File:Clock machine 16th century-Convent of Christ,Tomar, Portugal.jpg|thumb|16th-century clock machine [[Convent of Christ]], Tomar, Portugal]]\nBesides the Chinese astronomical clock of Su Song in 1088 mentioned above, contemporary [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]] also constructed a variety of highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their mosques and [[Observatory|observatories]],<ref name=Ajram>{{Cite book|last=Ajram|first=K.|year=1992|title=Miracle of Islamic Science|chapter=Appendix B|publisher=Knowledge House Publishers|isbn=0-911119-43-4}}</ref> such as the water-powered astronomical clock by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Donald R.|authorlink=Donald Routledge Hill|title=Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=May 1991|pages=64\u201369|ref=harv}}</ref> and the astrolabic clock by [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the early 14th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David A.|last=King|year=1983|title=The Astronomy of the Mamluks|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=74 |issue=4|pages=531\u2013555 [545\u2013546]|doi=10.1086/353360|ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f6d729951791821ed435a9819edbc6726650c3fe}}</ref> The most sophisticated timekeeping astrolabes were the [[gear]]ed astrolabe mechanisms designed by [[Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n B\u012br\u016bn\u012b]] in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display. Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz===\n[[File:Inside QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg|thumb|Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\n[[File:Split-flap clock.jpg|thumb|This clock used the 60&nbsp;Hz of electrical power, and features a split-flap physical for displaying the time numbers]]\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or \"beat\" dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47\u201350]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3-527-40230-4|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\n[[Image:Greenwich clock 1-manipulated.jpg|thumb|Shepherd Gate Clock received its timing signal from within the observatory]]\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, pp. 325\u2013328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52\u201362]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a dial with the numbers 1 through 12 or 24, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes one or two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>{{US Patent|7079452}}, {{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n\n====Digital====\n{{main|Digital clock}}\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It's about three o'clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f|first=t|p=s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng}}) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u9001\u7d42}}|s={{linktext|\u9001\u7ec8}}|first=t|p={{linktext|s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng}}}}).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233649/http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 |date=January 5, 2018 }} \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n==Specific types==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|upright|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.

All life on Earth is part of a single phylogenetic tree, indicating [[common ancestry]].\n\nIn a ''rooted'' phylogenetic tree, each node with descendants represents the inferred [[most recent common ancestor]] of those descendants, and the edge lengths in some trees may be interpreted as time estimates. Each node is called a taxonomic unit. Internal nodes are generally called hypothetical taxonomic units, as they cannot be directly observed. Trees are useful in fields of biology such as [[bioinformatics]], [[systematics]], and [[phylogenetics]]. ''Unrooted'' trees illustrate only the relatedness of the [[leaf nodes]] and do not require the ancestral root to be known or inferred.\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of a \"[[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]\" arose from ancient notions of a ladder-like progression from lower into higher forms of [[life]] (such as in the [[Great Chain of Being]]). Early representations of \"branching\" phylogenetic trees include a \"paleontological chart\" showing the geological relationships among plants and animals in the book ''Elementary Geology'', by [[Edward Hitchcock]] (first edition: 1840).\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] (1859) also produced one of the first illustrations and crucially popularized the notion of an [[Natural selection|evolutionary \"tree\"]] in his seminal book ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. Over a century later, [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]s still use [[Tree structure|tree diagram]]s to depict [[evolution]] because such diagrams effectively convey the concept that [[speciation]] occurs through the [[Adaptation|adaptive]] and semi[[random]] splitting of lineages. Over time, species classification has become less static and more dynamic.\n\nThe term ''phylogenetic'', or ''phylogeny'', derives from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03c6\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}} ({{grc-transl|\u03c6\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}}), meaning \"race, lineage\", and {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ({{grc-transl|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}), meaning \"origin, source\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 du dictionnaire grec fran\u00e7ais |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=978-2010035289 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |website=www.tabularium.be |access-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421003247/http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |archivedate=April 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Rooted tree ===\n[[File:Phylogenetic treePureThickBraille.jpg|thumb|Rooted phylogenetic tree based on [[:File:Phylogenetic tree.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phylogenetic_tree.svg]], optimized for blind people. The lowest point of the tree is the root, which symbolizes the universal common ancestor to all living beings. The tree branches out into three main groups: Bacteria (left branch, letters a to i), Archea (middle branch, letters j to p) and Eukaryota (right branch, letters q to z). Each letter corresponds to a group of organisms, listed below this description. These letters and the description should be converted to Braille font, and printed using a Braille printer. The figure can be 3D printed by copying the png file and using Cura or other software to generate the Gcode for 3D printing.]]\nA rooted phylogenetic tree (see two graphics at top) is a [[directed graph|directed]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]] with a unique node \u2014 the root \u2014 corresponding to the (usually [[imputation (statistics)|imputed]]) most recent common ancestor of all the entities at the [[leaf node|leaves]] of the tree. The root node does not have a parent node, but serves as the parent of all other nodes in the tree. The root is therefore a node of [[Node (computer science)#Nodes and trees|degree]] 2 while other internal nodes have a minimum degree of 3 (where \"degree\" here refers to the total number of incoming and outgoing edges).\n\nThe most common method for rooting trees is the use of an uncontroversial [[outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]]\u2014close enough to allow inference from trait data or molecular sequencing, but far enough to be a clear outgroup.\n\n=== Unrooted tree ===\n[[Image:MyosinUnrootedTree.jpg|thumb|340px|An unrooted phylogenetic tree for [[myosin]], a [[gene family|superfamily]] of [[protein]]s.<ref name=Hodge_2000>{{cite journal|vauthors=Hodge T, Cope M |title=A myosin family tree|journal=J Cell Sci|volume=113|issue=19|pages=3353\u20134|date=1 October 2000|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/113/19/3353|pmid=10984423|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043742/http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/113/19/3353|archivedate=30 September 2007}}</ref>]]\n\nUnrooted trees illustrate the relatedness of the leaf nodes without making assumptions about ancestry.

By contrast, inferring the root of an unrooted tree requires some means of identifying ancestry.

A rooted bifurcating tree has exactly two descendants arising from each [[interior node]] (that is, it forms a [[binary tree]]), and an unrooted bifurcating tree takes the form of an [[unrooted binary tree]], a [[free tree]] with exactly three neighbors at each internal node. In contrast, a rooted multifurcating tree may have more than two children at some nodes and an unrooted multifurcating tree may have more than three neighbors at some nodes.\n\n=== Labeled versus unlabeled ===\nBoth rooted and unrooted trees can be either labeled or unlabeled. A labeled tree has specific values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree, sometimes called a tree shape, defines a topology only.\n\n=== Enumerating trees ===\n[[File:Number of trees as a function of the number of leaves.svg|thumb|Increase in the total number of phylogenetic trees as a function of the number of labeled leaves: unrooted binary trees (blue diamonds), rooted binary trees (red circles), and rooted multifurcating or binary trees (green: triangles). The Y-axis scale is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].]]\nThe number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree, but there are always more labeled than unlabeled trees, more multifurcating than bifurcating trees, and more rooted than unrooted trees. The last distinction is the most biologically relevant; it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root.

Distance-matrix methods such as [[neighbor-joining]] or [[UPGMA]], which calculate [[genetic distance]] from [[multiple sequence alignment]]s, are simplest to implement, but do not invoke an evolutionary model. Many sequence alignment methods such as [[ClustalW]] also create trees by using the simpler algorithms (i.e. those based on distance) of tree construction. [[Maximum parsimony]] is another simple method of estimating phylogenetic trees, but implies an implicit model of evolution (i.e. parsimony). More advanced methods use the [[optimality criterion]] of [[maximum likelihood]], often within a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]], and apply an explicit model of evolution to phylogenetic tree estimation.<ref name=\"Felsenstein\" /> Identifying the optimal tree using many of these techniques is [[NP-hard]],<ref name=\"Felsenstein\" /> so [[heuristic]] search and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods are used in combination with tree-scoring functions to identify a reasonably good tree that fits the data.\n\nTree-building methods can be assessed on the basis of several criteria:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Penny | first1 = D. | last2 = Hendy | first2 = M.

Most importantly, the trees that they generate are not necessarily correct \u2013 they do not necessarily accurately represent the evolutionary history of the included taxa.

This is most true of genetic material that is subject to lateral gene transfer and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], where different [[haplotype]] blocks can have different histories. In these types of analysis, the output tree of a phylogenetic analysis of a single gene is an estimate of the gene's phylogeny (i.e. a gene tree) and not the phylogeny of the [[taxa]] (i.e. species tree) from which these characters were sampled, though ideally, both should be very close. For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes),<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2019.143967 |pmid=31279710 |title=Diagnosis of mitogenome for robust phylogeny: A case of Cypriniformes fish group |journal=Gene |volume=713 |pages=143967 |year=2019 |author1=Parhi, J. |author2=Tripathy, P.S. |author3=Priyadarshi, H. |author4=Mandal, S.C. |author5=Pandey, P.K. }}</ref> or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that [[homoplasy]] (false [[homology (biology)|homology]]) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.\n\nWhen extinct species are included as [[leaf node|terminal node]]s in an analysis (rather than, for example, to constrain internal nodes), they are considered not to represent direct ancestors of any extant species.

Development of technologies able to infer sequences from smaller fragments, or from spatial patterns of DNA degradation products, would further expand the range of DNA considered useful.\n\nPhylogenetic trees can also be inferred from a range of other data types, including morphology, the presence or absence of particular types of genes, insertion and deletion events \u2013 and any other observation thought to contain an evolutionary signal.\n\n[[Phylogenetic network]]s are used when bifurcating trees are not suitable, due to these complications which suggest a more reticulate evolutionary history of the organisms sampled.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cladistics]]\n* [[Comparative phylogenetics]]\n* [[Computational phylogenetics]]\n* [[Evolutionary taxonomy]]\n* [[Evolutionary biology]]\n* [[Generalized tree alignment]]\n* [[List of phylogenetics software]]\n* [[List of phylogenetic tree visualization software]]\n* [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==<!-- MolPhylEvol46:375;48:23,48:313. -->\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Schuh, R.

All life on Earth is part of a single phylogenetic tree, indicating [[common ancestry]].\n\nIn a ''rooted'' phylogenetic tree, each node with descendants represents the inferred [[most recent common ancestor]] of those descendants, and the edge lengths in some trees may be interpreted as time estimates. Each node is called a taxonomic unit. Internal nodes are generally called hypothetical taxonomic units, as they cannot be directly observed. Trees are useful in fields of biology such as [[bioinformatics]], [[systematics]], and [[phylogenetics]]. ''Unrooted'' trees illustrate only the relatedness of the [[leaf nodes]] and do not require the ancestral root to be known or inferred.\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of a \"[[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]\" arose from ancient notions of a ladder-like progression from lower into higher forms of [[life]] (such as in the [[Great Chain of Being]]). Early representations of \"branching\" phylogenetic trees include a \"paleontological chart\" showing the geological relationships among plants and animals in the book ''Elementary Geology'', by [[Edward Hitchcock]] (first edition: 1840).\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] (1859) also produced one of the first illustrations and crucially popularized the notion of an [[Natural selection|evolutionary \"tree\"]] in his seminal book ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. Over a century later, [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]]s still use [[Tree structure|tree diagram]]s to depict [[evolution]] because such diagrams effectively convey the concept that [[speciation]] occurs through the [[Adaptation|adaptive]] and semi[[random]] splitting of lineages. Over time, species classification has become less static and more dynamic.\n\nThe term ''phylogenetic'', or ''phylogeny'', derives from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03c6\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}} ({{grc-transl|\u03c6\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}}), meaning \"race, lineage\", and {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} ({{grc-transl|\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}), meaning \"origin, source\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 du dictionnaire grec fran\u00e7ais |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=978-2010035289 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole |website=www.tabularium.be |access-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421003247/http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |archivedate=April 21, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Rooted tree ===\n[[File:Phylogenetic treePureThickBraille.jpg|thumb|Rooted phylogenetic tree based on [[:File:Phylogenetic tree.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phylogenetic_tree.svg]], optimized for blind people.

Each letter corresponds to a group of organisms, listed below this description. These letters and the description should be converted to Braille font, and printed using a Braille printer. The figure can be 3D printed by copying the png file and using Cura or other software to generate the Gcode for 3D printing.]]\nA rooted phylogenetic tree (see two graphics at top) is a [[directed graph|directed]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]] with a unique node \u2014 the root \u2014 corresponding to the (usually [[imputation (statistics)|imputed]]) most recent common ancestor of all the entities at the [[leaf node|leaves]] of the tree. The root node does not have a parent node, but serves as the parent of all other nodes in the tree. The root is therefore a node of [[Node (computer science)#Nodes and trees|degree]] 2 while other internal nodes have a minimum degree of 3 (where \"degree\" here refers to the total number of incoming and outgoing edges).\n\nThe most common method for rooting trees is the use of an uncontroversial [[outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]]\u2014close enough to allow inference from trait data or molecular sequencing, but far enough to be a clear outgroup.\n\n=== Unrooted tree ===\n[[Image:MyosinUnrootedTree.jpg|thumb|340px|An unrooted phylogenetic tree for [[myosin]], a [[gene family|superfamily]] of [[protein]]s.<ref name=Hodge_2000>{{cite journal|vauthors=Hodge T, Cope M |title=A myosin family tree|journal=J Cell Sci|volume=113|issue=19|pages=3353\u20134|date=1 October 2000|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/113/19/3353|pmid=10984423|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043742/http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/113/19/3353|archivedate=30 September 2007}}</ref>]]\n\nUnrooted trees illustrate the relatedness of the leaf nodes without making assumptions about ancestry.

A labeled tree has specific values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree, sometimes called a tree shape, defines a topology only.\n\n=== Enumerating trees ===\n[[File:Number of trees as a function of the number of leaves.svg|thumb|Increase in the total number of phylogenetic trees as a function of the number of labeled leaves: unrooted binary trees (blue diamonds), rooted binary trees (red circles), and rooted multifurcating or binary trees (green: triangles). The Y-axis scale is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].]]\nThe number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree, but there are always more labeled than unlabeled trees, more multifurcating than bifurcating trees, and more rooted than unrooted trees. The last distinction is the most biologically relevant; it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root. For bifurcating labeled trees, the total number of rooted trees is:\n\n:<math> (2n-3)!! = \\frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-2}(n-2)!} </math> for <math>n \\ge 2</math>, where <math>n</math> represents the number of leaf nodes.<ref name=\"Felsenstein1978\">{{Cite journal|last=Felsenstein|first=Joseph|date=1978-03-01|title=The Number of Evolutionary Trees|url=https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/27/1/27/1626689|journal=Systematic Biology|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=27\u201333|doi=10.2307/2412810|issn=1063-5157|jstor=2412810}}</ref>\n\nFor bifurcating labeled trees, the total number of unrooted trees is:<ref name=\"Felsenstein1978\"/>\n\n:<math> (2n-5)!! = \\frac{(2n-5)!}{2^{n-3}(n-3)!} </math> for <math>n \\ge 3</math>.\n\nAmong labeled bifurcating trees, the number of unrooted trees with <math>n</math> leaves is equal to the number of rooted trees with <math>n-1</math> leaves.<ref name=\"Felsenstein\">Felsenstein J.

Distance-matrix methods such as [[neighbor-joining]] or [[UPGMA]], which calculate [[genetic distance]] from [[multiple sequence alignment]]s, are simplest to implement, but do not invoke an evolutionary model. Many sequence alignment methods such as [[ClustalW]] also create trees by using the simpler algorithms (i.e. those based on distance) of tree construction. [[Maximum parsimony]] is another simple method of estimating phylogenetic trees, but implies an implicit model of evolution (i.e. parsimony). More advanced methods use the [[optimality criterion]] of [[maximum likelihood]], often within a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]], and apply an explicit model of evolution to phylogenetic tree estimation.<ref name=\"Felsenstein\" /> Identifying the optimal tree using many of these techniques is [[NP-hard]],<ref name=\"Felsenstein\" /> so [[heuristic]] search and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods are used in combination with tree-scoring functions to identify a reasonably good tree that fits the data.\n\nTree-building methods can be assessed on the basis of several criteria:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Penny | first1 = D. | last2 = Hendy | first2 = M.

Trees can also be built using [[T-theory]].<ref>A. Dress, K. T. Huber, and V. Moulton. 2001. Metric Spaces in Pure and Applied Mathematics.

Most importantly, the trees that they generate are not necessarily correct \u2013 they do not necessarily accurately represent the evolutionary history of the included taxa. As with any scientific result, they are subject to [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by further study (e.g., gathering of additional data, analyzing the existing data with improved methods). The data on which they are based may be [[signal noise|noisy]];<ref name=Townsend_2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=Townsend JP, Su Z, Tekle Y |title=Phylogenetic Signal and Noise: Predicting the Power of a Data Set to Resolve Phylogeny |journal=Genetics |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=835\u2013849 |year=2012 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/sys036 |pmid=22389443 |doi-access=free }}</ref> the analysis can be confounded by [[genetic recombination]],<ref name=Arenas_2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Arenas M, Posada D |title=The effect of recombination on the reconstruction of ancestral sequences |journal=Genetics |volume=184 |issue=4 |pages=1133\u20131139 |year=2010 |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.113423 |pmid=20124027 |pmc=2865913 }}</ref> [[horizontal gene transfer]],<ref name=Woese_2002>{{cite journal |author=Woese C |title=On the evolution of cells |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=99 |issue=13 |pages=8742\u20137 |year=2002 |pmid=12077305 |doi=10.1073/pnas.132266999 |pmc=124369|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.8742W }}</ref> [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation between species that were not nearest neighbors on the tree before hybridisation takes place, [[convergent evolution]], and [[conserved sequence]]s.\n\nAlso, there are problems in basing an analysis on a single type of character, such as a single [[gene]] or [[protein]] or only on morphological analysis, because such trees constructed from another unrelated data source often differ from the first, and therefore great care is needed in inferring phylogenetic relationships among species. This is most true of genetic material that is subject to lateral gene transfer and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], where different [[haplotype]] blocks can have different histories. In these types of analysis, the output tree of a phylogenetic analysis of a single gene is an estimate of the gene's phylogeny (i.e. a gene tree) and not the phylogeny of the [[taxa]] (i.e. species tree) from which these characters were sampled, though ideally, both should be very close. For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes),<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2019.143967 |pmid=31279710 |title=Diagnosis of mitogenome for robust phylogeny: A case of Cypriniformes fish group |journal=Gene |volume=713 |pages=143967 |year=2019 |author1=Parhi, J. |author2=Tripathy, P.S. |author3=Priyadarshi, H. |author4=Mandal, S.C. |author5=Pandey, P.K. }}</ref> or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that [[homoplasy]] (false [[homology (biology)|homology]]) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.\n\nWhen extinct species are included as [[leaf node|terminal node]]s in an analysis (rather than, for example, to constrain internal nodes), they are considered not to represent direct ancestors of any extant species. Extinct species do not typically contain high-quality [[ancient DNA|DNA]].\n\nThe range of useful DNA materials has expanded with advances in extraction and sequencing technologies. Development of technologies able to infer sequences from smaller fragments, or from spatial patterns of DNA degradation products, would further expand the range of DNA considered useful.\n\nPhylogenetic trees can also be inferred from a range of other data types, including morphology, the presence or absence of particular types of genes, insertion and deletion events \u2013 and any other observation thought to contain an evolutionary signal.\n\n[[Phylogenetic network]]s are used when bifurcating trees are not suitable, due to these complications which suggest a more reticulate evolutionary history of the organisms sampled.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cladistics]]\n* [[Comparative phylogenetics]]\n* [[Computational phylogenetics]]\n* [[Evolutionary taxonomy]]\n* [[Evolutionary biology]]\n* [[Generalized tree alignment]]\n* [[List of phylogenetics software]]\n* [[List of phylogenetic tree visualization software]]\n* [[Phylogenetic comparative methods]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==<!-- MolPhylEvol46:375;48:23,48:313. -->\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Schuh, R.
