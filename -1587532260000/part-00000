With a population of 923,598 as of 2016,<ref name=\"2016census\"/> it is the most populous of Canada's three [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] and four [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]]. It is the country's [[Population of Canada by province and territory|second-most densely populated]] province and [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by area|second-smallest]] province by area, both after neighbouring [[Prince Edward Island]].<ref name=\"2016census\"/> Its area of {{convert|55,284|km2|mi2}} includes [[Cape Breton Island]] and 3,800 other coastal islands. The [[Nova Scotia peninsula|peninsula]] that makes up Nova Scotia's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]], on which the province's land border with [[New Brunswick]] is located. The province borders the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the northwest and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south and east, and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Northumberland Strait|Northumberland]] and [[Cabot Strait|Cabot]] straits, respectively.\n\nThe land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous [[Mi\ua78ckmaq]] people for thousands of years. [[France]]'s first settlement in North America, {{nobreak|[[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port-Royal]]}}, was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of [[Acadia]] for over a hundred years. The [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area, changing hands numerous times until France relinquished its claims with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] settled in Nova Scotia. In 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve [[responsible government]], and it [[Canadian Confederation|federated]] in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]) to form what is now the country of Canada.\n\nNova Scotia's [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], which today is home to about 45 per cent of the province's population, is the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|thirteenth-largest]] census metropolitan area in Canada,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nova-scotia|title=Nova Scotia {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> the largest city in Atlantic Canada, and Canada's second-largest coastal city (after [[Vancouver]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Further|Etymology of Scotland}}\n\"Nova Scotia\" means \"New Scotland\" in Latin<ref>[http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx Scottish Settlement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152640/http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx |date=7 December 2013 }}.

In general, Romance and Slavic languages use a direct translation of \"New Scotland\", while most other languages use direct transliterations of the Latin / English name. \n\nThe province was first named by the English in the 1621 Royal Charter granting to [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]] in 1632 the right to settle lands including modern Nova Scotia, [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]].<ref name=\"royalcharter\">{{cite book |title=Nova Scotia: The Royal Charter of 1621 to Sir William Alexander |url=https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20110202 |year=1922 |publisher=University of Toronto Press (Reprinted from the Transactions of the Royal Canadian Institute, Vol. XIV, Part 1) |location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Nova Scotia}}\n{{See also|List of provincial parks in Nova Scotia|List of protected areas of Nova Scotia}}\nNova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province in area, after [[Prince Edward Island]].

This is true although Nova Scotia is some fifteen parallels further south. Areas not on the Atlantic coast experience warmer summers more typical of inland areas, and winter lows are a little colder.\n\nDescribed on the provincial vehicle licence plate as Canada's Ocean Playground, Nova Scotia is surrounded by four major bodies of water: the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] to the north, the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the west, the [[Gulf of Maine]] to the southwest, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.<ref name=\"ECclimate\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for selected locations in Nova Scotia<ref name=\"Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010\">{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html|title=Canadian Climate Normals|publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada|date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n!Location\n!July (\u00b0C)\n!July (\u00b0F)\n!January (\u00b0C)\n!January (\u00b0F)\n|-\n|[[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] || 23/14 || 73/58 || 0/\u22128 || 32/17\n|-\n|[[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] || 23/12 || 73/54 || \u22121/\u22129 || 30/14\n|-\n|[[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]] || 25/14 || 78/57 || \u22121/\u221210 || 29/14\n|-\n|[[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] || 24/13 || 75/55 || \u22121/\u221212 || 29/9\n|-\n|[[Liverpool, Nova Scotia|Liverpool]] || 25/14 || 77/57 || 0/\u20139 || 32/15\n|-\n|[[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] || 23/12 || 73/54 || 1/\u22128 || 33/17\n|-\n|[[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] || 21/12 || 69/55 || 1/\u22127 || 33/19\n|}<!-- Do not add data that conflicts with the source -->\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nova Scotia}}\n{{See also|Military history of Nova Scotia}}\n[[File:Mi'kmaq people at Tufts Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada, ca. 1871.jpg|thumb|[[Mi'kmaq]] family in [[Tuft's Cove, Nova Scotia|Tuft's Cove]], 1871.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene's Treaty of 1725 |url=http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene 'sTreaty of 1725 |url=https://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf}}</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.

The [[Nova Scotia peninsula|peninsula]] that makes up Nova Scotia's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]], on which the province's land border with [[New Brunswick]] is located. The province borders the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the northwest and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south and east, and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Northumberland Strait|Northumberland]] and [[Cabot Strait|Cabot]] straits, respectively.\n\nThe land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous [[Mi\ua78ckmaq]] people for thousands of years. [[France]]'s first settlement in North America, {{nobreak|[[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port-Royal]]}}, was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of [[Acadia]] for over a hundred years. The [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area, changing hands numerous times until France relinquished its claims with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] settled in Nova Scotia. In 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve [[responsible government]], and it [[Canadian Confederation|federated]] in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]) to form what is now the country of Canada.\n\nNova Scotia's [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], which today is home to about 45 per cent of the province's population, is the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|thirteenth-largest]] census metropolitan area in Canada,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nova-scotia|title=Nova Scotia {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref> the largest city in Atlantic Canada, and Canada's second-largest coastal city (after [[Vancouver]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Further|Etymology of Scotland}}\n\"Nova Scotia\" means \"New Scotland\" in Latin<ref>[http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx Scottish Settlement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152640/http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx |date=7 December 2013 }}.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene's Treaty of 1725 |url=http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mascarene 'sTreaty of 1725 |url=https://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf}}</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne.

The [[Anti-Confederation Party]] was led by [[Joseph Howe]].

Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders [[Donald McKay]] and [[William Dawson Lawrence]]. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured when [[Joshua Slocum]] became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world (1895). International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the ''[[Bluenose]]'' schooner.
