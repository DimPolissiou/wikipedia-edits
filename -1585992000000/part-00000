Although Th\u00e9oden says that \"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,\" in the battle a massive army of [[Uruk-hai]] and Dunlendings sent by Saruman almost overwhelms the defences. Saruman's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] breach the fortress wall that blocks the valley by setting off an explosion in a [[culvert]]; [[Aragorn]] names it \"Saruman's devilry\" and \"the fire of [[Orthanc]]\"; the critic [[Tom Shippey]] calls it \"a kind of gunpowder\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|page=194}} The defenders hold out in the fortress until dawn, when Th\u00e9oden and Aragorn lead a [[cavalry charge]] that drives the Orcs from the fortress. They are surprised to see the valley to the enemy's rear blocked by a forest of tree-like Huorns that have walked from [[Fangorn]] in the night. On the sides of the valley are relieving forces assembled by [[Gandalf]] and Erkenbrand, a Rohirrim leader. These attack, driving the Orcs into the angry Huorn forest, from which the Orcs never emerge; the Huorns bury the Orcs's bodies in an earthen mound known as \"Death's Down\".\n\n[[Peter Jackson]]'s 2002 [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|film ''The Two Towers'']] makes the battle dramatic, following Tolkien's account quite closely, but with changes to the forces involved: the attackers do not include men or [[Warg#Tolkien|wargs]] (battle-wolves), and the defenders include a group of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-warriors sent by [[Elrond]], but except in the Extended DVD version do not include the Huorns.\n\nTolkien based Helm's Deep on England's [[Cheddar Gorge]], and its Glittering Caves of Aglarond on the cave complex that he had visited there.\n\n==Fictional geography==\n{{anchor|Glittering Caves of Aglarond}}\n[[File:Miniature reflections in Gough's Cave - geograph.org.uk - 1232463.jpg|thumb|left|The caves in Cheddar Gorge inspired Tolkien's Glittering Caves of Aglarond, at the head of the gorge of Helm's Deep.<ref name=\"Cheddar\"/>]]\n\nHelm's Deep is based on the [[Cheddar Gorge]], a [[limestone]] gorge 400 feet deep in the [[Mendip Hills]], with a large cave complex that Tolkien visited on his honeymoon in 1916 and revisited in 1940, and which he acknowledged as the original of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond at the head of Helm's Deep, behind the fortress.<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J.R.R.

Gandalf advised him to take refuge in the Hornburg fortress of Helm's Deep. Gandalf then left on an unexplained errand. Th\u00e9oden's army went to the area, where local people were commanded by a captain called Gamling the Old. Many of the men there were very old or young.

These state that the fortresses of Aglarond and [[Angrenost]] (renamed Isengard by the Rohirrim) were built by [[Gondor]] to guard the shoulders of the [[Gap of Rohan]]. Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of [[Gondor#Calenardhon|Calenardhon]] dwindled it was not maintained and was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with [[Dunlending]]s. When Cirion, [[Steward of Gondor]], gave Calenardhon to the [[\u00c9oth\u00e9od]], Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it ''S\u00fathburg'' (\"South-fortress\" in Old English). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Isengard. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.<ref name=\"Cirion and Eorl\" group=T>{{harvnb|''Unfinished Tales''|loc=part 3, ch. 3 \"Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1980}}}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Peter Jackson's film===\n[[File:Helmsdeep-siege.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|The Battle of Helm's Deep in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s 2002 film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' the [[keep]] was built into the mountainside and resembles a [[World War I]] [[bunker]], in keeping with Tolkien's history as a soldier in that war.

Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass; cities such as the mind of [[Durin the Deathless|Durin]] could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, or into the dark recesses where no light can come...<ref name=\"Road to Isengard\" group=T>{{harvnb|''Two Towers''|loc=book III, ch. 8 \"Road to Isengard\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1954}}}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Gondor sketch map.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Sketch map of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], [[Gondor]], and [[Mordor]] in the Third Age.

At one end of the wall the Hornburg castle stood on a spur of the mountain; a long stair led to its rear gate, and a long causeway led down forwards from its main gate. About two furlongs (400 metres) down from the gate was an outer trench and rampart, Helm's Dike, built right across the Deeping-coomb.

He then set out to the Fords of Isen, where his marshal Erkenbrand was fighting Saruman's forces. However, Th\u00e9oden found out that his forces had been scattered. Gandalf advised him to take refuge in the Hornburg fortress of Helm's Deep. Gandalf then left on an unexplained errand. Th\u00e9oden's army went to the area, where local people were commanded by a captain called Gamling the Old. Many of the men there were very old or young. The women and children of Th\u00e9oden's capital [[Edoras]] were safe in [[Dunharrow]], led by the King's niece [[\u00c9owyn]].<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nThe garrison of Helm's Deep consisted of some 1,000 men, but around 1,000 more defenders had arrived from across Rohan by the time of the battle.<ref>K.

They stormed the first defence, Helm's Dike, forcing the defenders to fall back to the fortress. They attempted to break down the gate with a [[battering ram]], but a sortie led by [[Aragorn]] and [[\u00c9omer]] briefly scattered the attackers.<ref name=\"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nThe Orcs and Dunlendings raised ladders to scale the wall, but were held back by the Men of Rohan atop the wall. Orcs crept into the culvert and made a breach in the wall using a \"blasting-fire\" from Orthanc, perhaps \"a kind of [[gunpowder]]\";{{sfn|Shippey|2005|page=194}} Saruman's army rushed in. Some defenders retreated to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, while others retreated to the Hornburg.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nSaruman's forces broke through the Hornburg gate just before dawn. At this moment, Helm's horn was sounded, and Th\u00e9oden and Aragorn rode out, followed by all the Rohirrim left inside. They cut their way through the Orcs and drove them back from the fortress walls to Helm's Dike.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nAs day dawned, both armies saw that a forest of angry, tree-like [[Huorns]] now filled the valley, trapping Saruman's army. Above them, Gandalf appeared on [[Shadowfax (Middle-earth)|Shadowfax]], with Erkenbrand and a thousand footsoldiers who had escaped from the Fords of Isen. They charged into the fray. The Dunlendings dropped their weapons, while the Orcs fled into the Huorn forest and were destroyed.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/> \n\nTolkien noted in a letter that he had created walking tree-creatures partly in response to his \"bitter disappointment and disgust from schooldays with the shabby use made in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' of the coming of 'Great [[Birnam Wood]] to high Dunsinane hill': I longed to devise a setting in which the trees might really march to war\".<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J.

The Rohirrim required that all hostilities cease, and that the Dunlendings retreat behind the [[List of Middle-earth rivers#I|River Isen]] again and never recross while bearing arms. Before they were freed, though, the Dunlending captives were put to work in repairing the fortress.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nThe bodies of the Orcs that had entered the forest of Huorns were never seen again; the Huorns had buried them in an earthen mound known as \"Death's Down\".<ref name=\"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nAmong the Rohirrim dead was H\u00e1ma, captain of Th\u00e9oden's personal guard and doorward of [[Meduseld|his hall]]; the Orcs had hewn his corpse, an atrocity that Th\u00e9oden recalled during his later parley with Saruman. Gimli had been wounded, but had killed 42 Orcs to Legolas's 41.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\n===Literary history===\n\nIn Book III, ch. 5 of ''The Two Towers'', Helm is described only as a \"hero of old wars\"; Tolkien did not envision him as a king when he wrote that chapter.<ref group=T>''[[The War of the Ring]]'' (''The History of Middle-earth'', vol VIII, p. 408)</ref>\n\nTolkien had not yet envisioned Helm's Deep in his first sketch for the decisive battle between Rohan and the forces of Saruman. In an outline published in ''The Treason of Isengard'' as \u201cThe Story Foreseen from Fangorn,\" the Rohirrim rode west at Gandalf's urging, as in the published text, but met the army of Saruman on the open plain. An indecisive battle ensued, after which the Rohirrim camped for the night, and woke to see the enemy surrounded and destroyed by a wood that had appeared overnight.<ref group=T>''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'' (''The History of Middle-earth'', vol VII, p. 435-436)</ref>\n\nIn a 1958 letter to Rhona Beare, one of a group of enthusiasts, Tolkien stated that the Rohirrim \"were not 'Mediaeval' in our sense\", but that all the same \"the styles of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (made in England) fit them well enough\", explaining that the soldiers in the tapestry are wearing [[chain-mail.]]<ref name=\"Letter 211\" group=T/>\n\n===Later writings===\n\nAfter the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings,'' Tolkien wrote about the history of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], in writings now collected by his son Christopher in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. These state that the fortresses of Aglarond and [[Angrenost]] (renamed Isengard by the Rohirrim) were built by [[Gondor]] to guard the shoulders of the [[Gap of Rohan]]. Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of [[Gondor#Calenardhon|Calenardhon]] dwindled it was not maintained and was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with [[Dunlending]]s. When Cirion, [[Steward of Gondor]], gave Calenardhon to the [[\u00c9oth\u00e9od]], Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it ''S\u00fathburg'' (\"South-fortress\" in Old English). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Isengard. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim.<ref name=\"Cirion and Eorl\" group=T>{{harvnb|''Unfinished Tales''|loc=part 3, ch. 3 \"Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1980}}}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Peter Jackson's film===\n[[File:Helmsdeep-siege.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|The Battle of Helm's Deep in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]\n\nIn [[Peter Jackson]]'s 2002 film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' the [[keep]] was built into the mountainside and resembles a [[World War I]] [[bunker]], in keeping with Tolkien's history as a soldier in that war.

Soon after, however, a large group of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]] join the defences, sent by [[Elrond]], at Galadriel's prompting.

By the early 1960s he was studying [[Shotokan]] [[karate]]-Do at the headquarters of the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA) and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[fishery|fisheries]] at [[Nihon University]].  He spent 1967 to 1969 as a game warden in [[Ethiopia]], setting up the new [[Semien Mountains National Park]]. He returned to Japan, writing a book about his Ethiopian experiences: ''From the Roof of Africa'' (1971).\n\nSince taking up residence in Japan he has written books and other literary works. In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting Writer's Award for a television drama written in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. He continued to be an active [[environmentalist]] and lectures about the environment, addressing issues such as [[deforestation]] and the preservation of natural environments. He is particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast [[woodland]]s. The C. W. Nicol Afan Woodland in Kurohime, [[Shinano, Nagano|Shinano]]machi, Nagano Prefecture, was established in 1986.\n\nHe became a Japanese citizen, which he wrote about in ''Boku ga Nihonjin ni natta riy\u016b'' (\"Why I became Japanese\").\n\nHe has written both fiction and non-fiction books, in both Japanese and in English. His subjects include [[whaling]] (for which he went on a trip on a whaling vessel), the environment, martial arts and children's fiction. His books have been translated between English and Japanese, as well as into [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].  In 2005, he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]].\n\nC. W. Nicol is the chairman of the Afan Woodland Trust.\n\n==Selected works==\n*''The White Shaman''\n*''Harpoon / Isana''\n*''[[The Boy Who Saw the Wind]]''\n*''The Raven's Tale''\n*''From the Roof of Africa''\n*''Moving Zen: Karate as a Way to Gentleness''\n*''The White Hippo''\n\n==Discography==\n* ''[[Sail Down the River]]'' (1991)\n* ''The World of Little Twins'' (1992)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hideo Levy]]<!--Other non-native Japanese author.-->\n* [[David Zoppetti]]<!--Other non-native Japanese author.-->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official site|http://www.cwnicol.com}}\n*[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life_column/old-nics-notebook Old Nic's Notebook : Japan Times]\n*[http://afan.or.jp Afan Woodland Trust]\n*[http://www.abcbookworld.com/?state=view_author&author_id=218 Short Biography at abcbookworld]\n*[http://www.koemagazine.com/2012/03/cw-nicol/ Ko-e Magazine Interview]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3032210.stm BBC News: Green mission for karate master]\n*[http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/He-s-Big--He-s-Bad--He-s---Japanese-.html?page=all Jeffrey Bartholet, He's Big, He's Bad, He's...Japanese?

Central to the Casa da \u00cdndia's objectives was the establishment and protection of a Portuguese ''[[mare clausum]]'' (total control of the seas) in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Arabian sea]], and the [[East Indies|Indies]]. It was founded by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] in 1500 to direct Portugal's monopoly of the [[spice trade]] and to manage royal policy for [[Portuguese India]]. Following 1503, it absorbed the ''[[Company of Guinea|Casa da Guin\u00e9 e Mina]]'', an organization founded by [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] in 1443, which operated under a similar mandate for [[Portuguese Africa]], thus making the Casa da \u00cdndia responsible for the regulation of all Portuguese imperial trade, the administration of Portuguese trade posts and military bases in Asia and Africa, and protection of the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]]'s commercial interests.\n\nFounded with the intent of protecting Portugal's [[monopoly]] on the spice trade, the Casa da \u00cdndia began financing and organizing the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] in 1497, annual armadas of [[galleon]]s, [[carrack]]s, and [[caravel]]s transporting commodities, like gold, ivory, and spices, between [[Lisbon]] and the Portuguese trade posts and colonies across Africa and Asia. The Casa da \u00cdndia sponsored numerous famous Portuguese navigators, including [[Vasco da Gama]] (who [[Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India|discovered the sea route to India]]), [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] (who discovered [[Brazil]]), and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (who established Portuguese hegemony in the [[Indian Ocean]]). Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the Casa da \u00cdndia rapidly grew into a economically powerful institution, playing a crucial role in the financing of the [[Portuguese discoveries]] and expeditions throughout [[West Africa]], [[East Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and the [[East Indies]]. The Casa da \u00cdndia similarly played an important role in the development of modern [[cartography]], patronizing the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', one of the first [[early world maps]].\n\nFrom its origins in the 1400s until its dissolution in 1833, the Casa da \u00cdndia's principal objectives changed with time, as did its relationships with the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Crown of Portugal]] and the imperial administration. Following 1642, it lost all of its trade monopolies on gold, silver, ivory, spices, and other precious commodities, transforming the organization's purview to a solely a trade regulator and [[customs]] agency. Following the destruction of its [[Ribeira Palace]] headquarters and facilities in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755]], the Casa da \u00cdndia grew increasingly obsolete in relation to Portugal's transforming trade and colonial policies, leading to most of its functions being slowly absorbed into ministries and agencies of the [[Portuguese government]] until its final dissolution in 1833.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lisbon in 1572 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ribeira Palace]] (on the right), where the Casa da \u00cdndia was headquartered, and its naval yards (on the left), in 1575.]]\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Casa da Guin\u00e9}}\n[[File:Elmina slave castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elmina Castle]], built in 1482 on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]], is the oldest European building in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Casa da Guin\u00e9|Casa da Guin\u00e9 e Mina]] was charged with managing and taxing Elmina along with the other Portuguese [[factory (trading post)|factories]] on the [[Gulf of Guinea]].]] \nThe forerunners of ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' arose with the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese exploration]] of the African coast, to manage new trade opportunities.\n\nAs early as 1434 the ''Casa de Ceuta'' was founded in Lisbon, but it was not very successful because the Muslim merchants diverted the trade routes from [[Ceuta]] to other places. Around 1443 in [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], Algarve, the ''Casa de Arguim'' and ''[[Company of Guinea|Casa da Guin\u00e9]]'', were established to administer Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]'s monopoly on African trade - essentially a set of sheds, warehouses and customs offices, dedicated to outfitting ships, hiring captains and crews, handing out trading licenses, receiving and selling goods and collecting dues.  \n\nAfter the death of [[Henry the Navigator]] in 1460, both houses were moved by King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] from [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] to [[Lisbon]].\n\nThe ascension of King [[John II of Portugal]] in 1481 revived the royal interest in African trade.  In 1482, upon erecting the fortress of [[Elmina|S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] to access the [[Akan people|Akan]] goldfields and markets,<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=Wilks, Ivor.

These armadas undertook the ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'' (\"India Run\"), following the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] first opened up by Vasco da Gama in 1497\u20131499.\n\nFor about thirty years, from 1503 to 1535, the Portuguese cut into the Venetian spice trade in the Mediterranean. By 1510, the Portuguese throne was pocketing a million [[Portuguese real|cruzados]] yearly from the spice trade alone, and it was this which led [[Francis I of France]] to dub King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] \"le roi \u00e9picier\", that is, \"the grocer king.\" \n\nIncome started to decline mid-century because of costs of maintaining a presence in Morocco and domestic waste. Also, Portugal did not develop a substantial domestic infrastructure to support this activity, but relied on foreigners for many services supporting their trading enterprises, and therefore a lot of the income was consumed in this way. \n\nIn 1549 the Portuguese trade center in Antwerp went bankrupt and was closed. As the crown became more overextended in the 1550s, it relied more and more on external financing. By about 1560 the income of the Casa da \u00cdndia was not able to cover its expenses. The Portuguese monarchy had become, in [[Garrett Mattingly]]'s phrase, the owner of \"a [[National bankruptcy|bankrupt]] wholesale grocery business.\"\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Projeto da recontrucao do edificio da Casa da India (cropped).jpg|thumb|450px|center|<center>Reconstruction proposal for the headquarters of the Casa da \u00cdndia after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755]].</center>]]\nIn 1709 at the Casa da \u00cdndia, the [[Jesuit]] priest Father [[Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o]] demonstrated the principles of hot air ballooning. He managed to levitate a ball indoors at the Casa da \u00cdndia in Lisbon. He later fled from Portugal to Spain, for fear of being accused of performing magic by the [[Inquisition]]\n\nThe [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Earthquake of 1755]] destroyed much of [[Lisbon]], including [[Ribeira Palace]], where the headquarters and naval yards of the Casa da \u00cdndia were located.\n\nThe final era of the Casa da \u00cdndia began in 1822, during the reign of King [[John VI of Portugal]], when a large number of its responsibilities were transferred to different ministries of the [[Portuguese Government]]. In 1833, the Casa da \u00cdndia was finally dissolved, by King [[Miguel I of Portugal]], and its functions were absorbed by the ''Alf\u00e2ndega de Lisboa'' (Customs Agency of Lisbon).\n\n== Organization ==\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o de Barros (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], a poet, author, and historian of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]], was ''[[Factor (agent)|Feitor]]'' of the Casa da \u00cdndia from 1532 to 1568.]]\n[[File:Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s flagship, the ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai|Santa Catarina do Sinai]]''.]]\nAlthough initially (c.1500) consolidated in one unit, the ''Casa da \u00cdndia e da Guin\u00e9'', it was separated again (c. 1506) into two distinct units,  ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' and the ''Casa da Mina e da Guin\u00e9'' again.  However, both houses were overseen by the same officers at the higher levels, so it was common to use the joint term, or simply just ''Casa da \u00cdndia'', to refer to both.\n\nThe Casas were overseen by the same director and the same three treasurers (''tesoreiros'') - one for receiving goods, one for the sale of goods, and a third to handle everything else.  There were five secretaries in charge of the administration - three for India, two for Mina and Guinea - and one chief factor (''feitor'') in charge of schedules and correspondence with all the Portuguese ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitorias]]'' around the world. One of the most famous people to hold this position was the chronicler [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], who was appointed ''feitor'' in 1532.\n\nThe Casa was in charge of monitoring the royal monopoly on the Asian and African trade, i.e. receiving goods, collecting [[duties]] on incoming goods, organizing the fleets (notably the yearly [[Portuguese India Armadas]]) and shipping schedules, ratifying contracts with private merchants, etc.  \n\nThe ''Casa'' had various ''mesas'' (departments) focused on specific areas - the spice trade, finances, ship scheduling, maintenance, training, documentation and legal matters.\n\n===Shipyards===\n[[File:Armanzens e Ribeira das Naus da Casa da India (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The ''Armaz\u00e9m da Guin\u00e9 e Indias'', the shipyards of the Casa da \u00cdndia.]]\nSeparately from the Casa was the ''Armaz\u00e9m da Guin\u00e9 e Indias'', the new name for the naval arsenal.  It was assigned all nautical responsibilities, i.e. the running of the Lisbon dockyards, the construction of ships, the hiring and training of crews and supplying the fleets with equipment - sails, ropes, guns, nautical instruments and maps.\n\nThe ''Piloto-Mor'' of the Armazem, a position held between 1503 and 1526 by Pero Anes, Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares and Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa, was probably responsible for the training of [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]-[[navigator]]s and the drafting of navigational charts.<ref>e.g. Teixeira da Mota (1969) \"Os Regimentos do cosm\u00f3grafo-mor de 1559 e 1592 e as origens do ensino n\u00e1utico em Portugal\",''Memorias da Academia das Ciencias de Lisboa'', vol. 13, pp.227-91.  J.I. Brito-Rebello (1903) ''Livro de Marinharia'' (Lisbon: Libanio da Silva) replicates the documents for the nominations of Pero Annes ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR74#v=onepage&q&f=false 18 February 1503]), Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa replacing Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares as \"patr\u00e3o\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR76#v=onepage&q&f=false 11 December 1522]) and \"piloto-mor\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR77#v=onepage&q&f=false 12 January 1525]), and Fernando Affonso as \"patr\u00e3o\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR78#v=onepage&q&f=false 15 November 1526])</ref> \n\nIn 1547, the position of ''Cosmografo-mor'' (High-Cosmographer) was created for the famed mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the cartographic duties passed over to him.\n\nThe ''Provedor dos Armaz\u00e9ms'' was in charge of screening and hiring of crews.  The ''Almoxarife'' or ''Recebedor dos Armaz\u00e9ms'', was the customs-collector, a highly-profitable job that was once held by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in the mid-1490s.\n\nAlthough theoretically separate, the ''Casa'' and the ''Armaz\u00e9m'' kept in contact and coordinated matters with each other, the expenses from one charged to the treasurer of the other, and officers moved seamlessly between them.  As a result, it was common to use ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' to refer to the whole complex. \n\n== Operations ==\n{{Colonial India}}\nIn 1504 all trading activities in Africa and, especially, in Asia were merged in the Casa da \u00cdndia, becoming subject to state control under the Portuguese kings. Under the supervision of the ''Vedor da Fazenda'' (chief royal treasurer) all products had to be handed over to the Casa, taxed  and sold at an agreed price with the proceeds paid to the owners.\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Cantino planisphere]] is the only surviving copy of the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', the secretive master-map of the world produced by the Casa da \u00cdndia's cartographers.]]\nThe Casa da \u00cdndia produced a secret map called the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', one of the first [[early world maps]]. The [[Cantino planisphere]] is the only existing copy of the ''Padr\u00e3o Real''.\n\nThe [[Teixeira planisphere]] was made by Domingos Teixeira in 1573.\n\n===Customs===\nThe ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' worked as [[customs]], central accounting office for funds and products in various overseas offices, [[archive]], [[warehouse]] management, personnel authority of sailors, soldiers and traders, as well as one of the world's first [[postal service]]s. \n\nIt fixed the prices and checked purchases, sales and payments. And also fitted the fleets, gathered the necessary military convoys, managed incoming and outgoing vessels and set out the various certificates and licenses. Through the Casa da \u00cdndia the royal officials were appointed overseas, and royal decrees and regulations were spread.\n\nBetween 1506 and 1570, Casa da \u00cdndia enforced the royal monopoly on all imports and sales of [[spices]] - pepper, cloves, and cinnamon - silk and [[shellac]], as well as on the export of gold, silver, copper and [[coral]], and levied a 30 percent tax on the profits of other articles.\n\n===Royal monopolies===\n[[File:Lisbon, Portugal (43216359132) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ribeira Palace]], headquarters of the Casa da \u00cdndia, and the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio|Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] (Palace Square) in [[Lisbon]] in the 18th century.]]\nThe royal monopoly on [[copper]] exports especially made great gains, as copper was in high demand in India and West Africa, to where it was exported in the form of armlets called ''[[manillas]]'', which served as a form of [[money]].<ref>[[Copper]] was the \"red gold\" of Africa, exported as ''[[manillas]]'', the ring-like armlets which served as a form of [[money]] or [[barter]] coinage amongst certain [[West African]] peoples in Guinea Coast, [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], see Chamberlain, C. C.(1963). The Teach Yourself ''Guide to Numismatics''. English Universities Press. P. 92. From contemporary records, we know the earliest Portuguese were made in Antwerp; between 1504 and 1507 Portugal exported 287,813 ''manillas'' into [[Guinea]] via San Jorge da Mina. vide Einzig, Paul (1949). ''Primitive Money in its ethnological, historical and economic aspects.'' Eyre & Spottiswoode. London. P. 155.</ref> From 1495 to 1521 the Portuguese Crown bought in [[Antwerp]], then the center of international trade, approximately 5,200 tonnes copper mainly from the [[Fugger]] of Hungary ([[Thurzo]]-Fugger company), which was shipped mostly to India.\n\nIn 1506, about 65% of the state income was produced on overseas activity. The monopoly of trade remained profitable until 1570, and strengthened the equity and credit capacity of Portugal. The share of the Crown's total trade with Asia in 1506 amounted to about 25% and increased steadily to 50% or more, but never entirely displaced the private traders: the trade monopoly was accompanied always by free trade in other products such as textiles, weapons, paper and salted fish, such as Bacalhau.\n\nRoyal monopolies were also leased out sometimes by Casa da \u00cdndia to private traders for a certain period.

Central to the Casa da \u00cdndia's objectives was the establishment and protection of a Portuguese ''[[mare clausum]]'' (total control of the seas) in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Arabian sea]], and the [[East Indies|Indies]]. It was founded by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] in 1500 to direct Portugal's monopoly of the [[spice trade]] and to manage royal policy for [[Portuguese India]]. Following 1503, it absorbed the ''[[Company of Guinea|Casa da Guin\u00e9 e Mina]]'', an organization founded by [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] in 1443, which operated under a similar mandate for [[Portuguese Africa]], thus making the Casa da \u00cdndia responsible for the regulation of all Portuguese imperial trade, the administration of Portuguese trade posts and military bases in Asia and Africa, and protection of the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese Crown]]'s commercial interests.\n\nFounded with the intent of protecting Portugal's [[monopoly]] on the spice trade, the Casa da \u00cdndia began financing and organizing the [[Portuguese India Armadas]] in 1497, annual armadas of [[galleon]]s, [[carrack]]s, and [[caravel]]s transporting commodities, like gold, ivory, and spices, between [[Lisbon]] and the Portuguese trade posts and colonies across Africa and Asia. The Casa da \u00cdndia sponsored numerous famous Portuguese navigators, including [[Vasco da Gama]] (who [[Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India|discovered the sea route to India]]), [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] (who discovered [[Brazil]]), and [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (who established Portuguese hegemony in the [[Indian Ocean]]). Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the Casa da \u00cdndia rapidly grew into a economically powerful institution, playing a crucial role in the financing of the [[Portuguese discoveries]] and expeditions throughout [[West Africa]], [[East Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and the [[East Indies]]. The Casa da \u00cdndia similarly played an important role in the development of modern [[cartography]], patronizing the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', one of the first [[early world maps]].\n\nFrom its origins in the 1400's until its dissolution in 1833, the Casa da \u00cdndia's principal objectives changed with time, as did its relationships with the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Crown of Portugal]] and the imperial administration. Following 1642, it lost all of its trade monopolies on gold, silver, ivory, spices, and other precious commodities, transforming the organization's purview to a solely a trade regulator and [[customs]] agency. Following the destruction of its [[Ribeira Palace]] headquarters and facilities in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755]], the Casa da \u00cdndia grew increasingly obsolete in relation to Portugal's transforming trade and colonial policies, leading to most of its functions being slowly absorbed into ministries and agencies of the [[Portuguese government]] until its final dissolution in 1833.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lisbon in 1572 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ribeira Palace]] (on the right), where the Casa da \u00cdndia was headquartered, and its naval yards (on the left), in 1575.]]\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Casa da Guin\u00e9}}\n[[File:Elmina slave castle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elmina Castle]], built in 1482 on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]], is the oldest European building in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The [[Casa da Guin\u00e9|Casa da Guin\u00e9 e Mina]] was charged with managing and taxing Elmina along with the other Portuguese [[factory (trading post)|factories]] on the [[Gulf of Guinea]].]] \nThe forerunners of ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' arose with the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese exploration]] of the African coast, to manage new trade opportunities.\n\nAs early as 1434 the ''Casa de Ceuta'' was founded in Lisbon, but it was not very successful because the Muslim merchants diverted the trade routes from [[Ceuta]] to other places. Around 1443 in [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], Algarve, the ''Casa de Arguim'' and ''[[Company of Guinea|Casa da Guin\u00e9]]'', were established to administer Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]'s monopoly on African trade - essentially a set of sheds, warehouses and customs offices, dedicated to outfitting ships, hiring captains and crews, handing out trading licenses, receiving and selling goods and collecting dues.  \n\nAfter the death of [[Henry the Navigator]] in 1460, both houses were moved by King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] from [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] to [[Lisbon]].\n\nThe ascension of King [[John II of Portugal]] in 1481 revived the royal interest in African trade.  In 1482, upon erecting the fortress of [[Elmina|S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] to access the [[Akan people|Akan]] goldfields and markets,<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=Wilks, Ivor.

These armadas undertook the ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'' (\"India Run\"), following the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] first opened up by Vasco da Gama in 1497\u20131499.\n\nFor about thirty years, from 1503 to 1535, the Portuguese cut into the Venetian spice trade in the Mediterranean. By 1510, the Portuguese throne was pocketing a million [[Portuguese real|cruzados]] yearly from the spice trade alone, and it was this which led [[Francis I of France]] to dub King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] \"le roi \u00e9picier\", that is, \"the grocer king.\" \n\nIncome started to decline mid-century because of costs of maintaining a presence in Morocco and domestic waste. Also, Portugal did not develop a substantial domestic infrastructure to support this activity, but relied on foreigners for many services supporting their trading enterprises, and therefore a lot of the income was consumed in this way. \n\nIn 1549 the Portuguese trade center in Antwerp went bankrupt and was closed. As the crown became more overextended in the 1550s, it relied more and more on external financing. By about 1560 the income of the Casa da \u00cdndia was not able to cover its expenses. The Portuguese monarchy had become, in [[Garrett Mattingly]]'s phrase, the owner of \"a [[National bankruptcy|bankrupt]] wholesale grocery business.\"\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Projeto da recontrucao do edificio da Casa da India (cropped).jpg|thumb|450px|center|<center>Reconstruction proposal for the headquarters of the Casa da \u00cdndia after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755]].</center>]]\nIn 1709 at the Casa da \u00cdndia, the [[Jesuit]] priest Father [[Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o]] demonstrated the principles of hot air ballooning. He managed to levitate a ball indoors at the Casa da \u00cdndia in Lisbon. He later fled from Portugal to Spain, for fear of being accused of performing magic by the [[Inquisition]]\n\nThe [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great Earthquake of 1755]] destroyed much of [[Lisbon]], including [[Ribeira Palace]], where the headquarters and naval yards of the Casa da \u00cdndia were located.\n\nThe final era of the Casa da \u00cdndia began in 1822, during the reign of King [[John VI of Portugal]], when a large number of its responsibilities were transferred to different ministries of the [[Portuguese Government]]. In 1833, the Casa da \u00cdndia was finally dissolved, by King [[Miguel I of Portugal]], and its functions were absorbed by the ''Alf\u00e2ndega de Lisboa'' (Customs Agency of Lisbon).\n\n== Organization ==\n[[File:Jo\u00e3o de Barros (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], a poet, author, and historian of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]], was ''[[Factor (agent)|Feitor]]'' of the Casa da \u00cdndia from 1532 to 1568.]]\n[[File:Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s flagship, the ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai|Santa Catarina do Sinai]]''.]]\nAlthough initially (c.1500) consolidated in one unit, the ''Casa da \u00cdndia e da Guin\u00e9'', it was separated again (c. 1506) into two distinct units,  ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' and the ''Casa da Mina e da Guin\u00e9'' again.  However, both houses were overseen by the same officers at the higher levels, so it was common to use the joint term, or simply just ''Casa da \u00cdndia'', to refer to both.\n\nThe Casas were overseen by the same director and the same three treasurers (''tesoreiros'') - one for receiving goods, one for the sale of goods, and a third to handle everything else.  There were five secretaries in charge of the administration - three for India, two for Mina and Guinea - and one chief factor (''feitor'') in charge of schedules and correspondence with all the Portuguese ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitorias]]'' around the world. One of the most famous people to hold this position was the chronicler [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], who was appointed ''feitor'' in 1532.\n\nThe Casa was in charge of monitoring the royal monopoly on the Asian and African trade, i.e. receiving goods, collecting [[duties]] on incoming goods, organizing the fleets (notably the yearly [[Portuguese India Armadas]]) and shipping schedules, ratifying contracts with private merchants, etc.  \n\nThe ''Casa'' had various ''mesas'' (departments) focused on specific areas - the spice trade, finances, ship scheduling, maintenance, training, documentation and legal matters.\n\n===Shipyards===\n[[File:Armanzens e Ribeira das Naus da Casa da India (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The ''Armaz\u00e9m da Guin\u00e9 e Indias'', the shipyards of the Casa da \u00cdndia.]]\nSeparately from the Casa was the ''Armaz\u00e9m da Guin\u00e9 e Indias'', the new name for the naval arsenal.  It was assigned all nautical responsibilities, i.e. the running of the Lisbon dockyards, the construction of ships, the hiring and training of crews and supplying the fleets with equipment - sails, ropes, guns, nautical instruments and maps.\n\nThe ''Piloto-Mor'' of the Armazem, a position held between 1503 and 1526 by Pero Anes, Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares and Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa, was probably responsible for the training of [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]-[[navigator]]s and the drafting of navigational charts.<ref>e.g. Teixeira da Mota (1969) \"Os Regimentos do cosm\u00f3grafo-mor de 1559 e 1592 e as origens do ensino n\u00e1utico em Portugal\",''Memorias da Academia das Ciencias de Lisboa'', vol. 13, pp.227-91.  J.I. Brito-Rebello (1903) ''Livro de Marinharia'' (Lisbon: Libanio da Silva) replicates the documents for the nominations of Pero Annes ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR74#v=onepage&q&f=false 18 February 1503]), Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa replacing Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares as \"patr\u00e3o\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR76#v=onepage&q&f=false 11 December 1522]) and \"piloto-mor\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR77#v=onepage&q&f=false 12 January 1525]), and Fernando Affonso as \"patr\u00e3o\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8vwnAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR78#v=onepage&q&f=false 15 November 1526])</ref> \n\nIn 1547, the position of ''Cosmografo-mor'' (High-Cosmographer) was created for the famed mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the cartographic duties passed over to him.\n\nThe ''Provedor dos Armaz\u00e9ms'' was in charge of screening and hiring of crews.  The ''Almoxarife'' or ''Recebedor dos Armaz\u00e9ms'', was the customs-collector, a highly-profitable job that was once held by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in the mid-1490s.\n\nAlthough theoretically separate, the ''Casa'' and the ''Armaz\u00e9m'' kept in contact and coordinated matters with each other, the expenses from one charged to the treasurer of the other, and officers moved seamlessly between them.  As a result, it was common to use ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' to refer to the whole complex. \n\n== Operations ==\n{{Colonial India}}\nIn 1504 all trading activities in Africa and, especially, in Asia were merged in the Casa da \u00cdndia, becoming subject to state control under the Portuguese kings. Under the supervision of the ''Vedor da Fazenda'' (chief royal treasurer) all products had to be handed over to the Casa, taxed  and sold at an agreed price with the proceeds paid to the owners.\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Cantino planisphere]] is the only surviving copy of the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', the secretive master-map of the world produced by the Casa da \u00cdndia's cartographers.]]\nThe Casa da \u00cdndia produced a secret map called the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', one of the first [[early world maps]]. The [[Cantino planisphere]] is the only existing copy of the ''Padr\u00e3o Real''.\n\nThe [[Teixeira planisphere]] was made by Domingos Teixeira in 1573.\n\n===Customs===\nThe ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' worked as [[customs]], central accounting office for funds and products in various overseas offices, [[archive]], [[warehouse]] management, personnel authority of sailors, soldiers and traders, as well as one of the world's first [[postal service]]s. \n\nIt fixed the prices and checked purchases, sales and payments. And also fitted the fleets, gathered the necessary military convoys, managed incoming and outgoing vessels and set out the various certificates and licenses. Through the Casa da \u00cdndia the royal officials were appointed overseas, and royal decrees and regulations were spread.\n\nBetween 1506 and 1570, Casa da \u00cdndia enforced the royal monopoly on all imports and sales of [[spices]] - pepper, cloves, and cinnamon - silk and [[shellac]], as well as on the export of gold, silver, copper and [[coral]], and levied a 30 percent tax on the profits of other articles.\n\n===Royal monopolies===\n[[File:Lisbon, Portugal (43216359132) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ribeira Palace]], headquarters of the Casa da \u00cdndia, and the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio|Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] (Palace Square) in [[Lisbon]] in the 18th century.]]\nThe royal monopoly on [[copper]] exports especially made great gains, as copper was in high demand in India and West Africa, to where it was exported in the form of armlets called ''[[manillas]]'', which served as a form of [[money]].<ref>[[Copper]] was the \"red gold\" of Africa, exported as ''[[manillas]]'', the ring-like armlets which served as a form of [[money]] or [[barter]] coinage amongst certain [[West African]] peoples in Guinea Coast, [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], see Chamberlain, C.

The monopoly of trade remained profitable until 1570, and strengthened the equity and credit capacity of Portugal. The share of the Crown's total trade with Asia in 1506 amounted to about 25% and increased steadily to 50% or more, but never entirely displaced the private traders: the trade monopoly was accompanied always by free trade in other products such as textiles, weapons, paper and salted fish, such as Bacalhau.\n\nRoyal monopolies were also leased out sometimes by Casa da \u00cdndia to private traders for a certain period.

As part of the formation of Imperial, the Royal College was moved into a new building at South Kensington in 1906, which also housed the [[Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London|Chemistry Department]]. From 1906 to 1932 the head of the Physics Department was Prof. H. L. Callender, famous for his work on the properties of steam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Imperial College London, 1907-2007|last=Gay|first=Hannah|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=9781860947087|location=|pages=152}}</ref>\n\n[[George Paget Thomson|G P Thomson]] (son of [[J J Thomson]]) replaced Callender in 1932, and worked in part on nuclear physics and atomic weaponry. He was followed P. M. S. Blackett as head in around 1953, with the construction of the new Physics building starting at about the same time. Blackett refocused efforts from low-energy physics to high-energy nuclear physics, and under him research started into [[cosmic ray]]s and the use of [[bubble chamber]]s, with the first liquid hydrogen bubble chamber in Western Europe being constructed at the department. Work on satellite instrumentation resulted in departmentally designed equipment ending up on NASA satellites in 1962. Physics continued in the new \u201cold\u201d RCS building until the new Physics building was finished in 1961, which subsequently became known as the Blackett Laboratory.<ref name=\"DeptHist\">[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/about/department-history/ Department History] Accessed 28 January 2017</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Imperial College London, 1907-2007|last=Gay|first=Hannah|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=9781860947087|location=|pages=333\u2013336}}</ref> In 2019, it was announced that the laboratory would be constructing a magnetometer instrument for the [[European Space Agency]] [[Solar Orbiter]] in a mission to study the [[Sun]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-solar-orbiter-instrument-sends-measurements|date=17 Feb 2020|website=gov.uk|title=First Solar Orbiter instrument sends measurements|publisher=[[UK Space Agency]]|access-date=4 Apr 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193499/solar-orbiter-spacecraft-heads-launch-site/|title=Solar Orbiter spacecraft heads to launch site on its way to the Sun {{!}} Imperial News {{!}} Imperial College London|date=|website=Imperial News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> The satellite launched on an [[Atlas V]] from the [[Cape Canaveral AFS]], [[Florida]] on the 9 February, 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.space.com/solar-orbiter-atlas-v-rocket-launch-success.html|title=Solar Orbiter launches on historic mission to study the sun's poles|access-date=4 Apr 2020|work=[[Space.com]]|author=Amy Thompson}}</ref> In November 2019, a team of Imperial physicists was chosen to design parts of the [[Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment]], which is to be a long baseline accelerator [[neutrino]] experiment in the [[United States]].<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/194106/imperial-among-uk-institutions-building-parts/|title=Imperial among UK institutions building parts for new \u00a330m neutrino detector {{!}} Imperial News {{!}} Imperial College London|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|website=Imperial News|language=en|date=November 2019|access-date=2019-11-29|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|last5=|first5=}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Study===\n====Undergraduate====\nThe department offers three year [[BSc]] and four year undergraduate [[MSci]] courses.<ref>{{cite-web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/physics-department/|title=Department of Physics {{!}} Study}}</ref> The department has connections with universities in Europe, allowing undergraduate master's students to study-abroad during their course.

As part of the formation of Imperial, the Royal College was moved into a new building at South Kensington in 1906, which also housed the [[Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London|Chemistry Department]]. From 1906 to 1932 the head of the Physics Department was Prof. H. L. Callender, famous for his work on the properties of steam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Imperial College London, 1907-2007|last=Gay|first=Hannah|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=9781860947087|location=|pages=152}}</ref>\n\n[[George Paget Thomson|G P Thomson]] (son of [[J J Thomson]]) replaced Callender in 1932, and worked in part on nuclear physics and atomic weaponry. He was followed P. M. S. Blackett as head in around 1953, with the construction of the new Physics building starting at about the same time. Blackett refocused efforts from low-energy physics to high-energy nuclear physics, and under him research started into [[cosmic ray]]s and the use of [[bubble chamber]]s, with the first liquid hydrogen bubble chamber in Western Europe being constructed at the department. Work on satellite instrumentation resulted in departmentally designed equipment ending up on NASA satellites in 1962. Physics continued in the new \u201cold\u201d RCS building until the new Physics building was finished in 1961, which subsequently became known as the Blackett Laboratory.<ref name=\"DeptHist\">[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/about/department-history/ department history at imperial.ac.uk/physics/about] Accessed 28 January 2017</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The History of Imperial College London, 1907-2007|last=Gay|first=Hannah|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=9781860947087|location=|pages=333\u2013336}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Study===\n====Undergraduate====\nThe department offers three year [[BSc]] and four year undergraduate [[MSci]] courses.<ref>{{cite-web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/physics-department/|title=Department of Physics {{!}} Study}}</ref> The department has connections with universities in Europe, allowing undergraduate master's students to study-abroad during their course.
