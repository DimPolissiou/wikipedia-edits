From two sides (northern and western), it is surrounded by river Baya. The population of this village is approximately 1800. It is dominated by [[Bhumihar]]s. At the western end side of the village, scheduled caste (SC) people and Muslim people reside. There are two primary schools in the village namely Rajkiya Kanya Madhaya Vidyalaya, Gorgama and Rajkiya Sankul pradhmik Vidyala, Gorgama. Both these schools are located at the end of the village very near to each other towards Baya river side and just after the schools,there is SC population and after that one can find Muslim houses along both sides of road. Primarily the entire village was dependent on [[agriculture]]. Land is mainly possessed by upper Bhumihar caste people. As with other villages of Bihar, male population has migrated to big cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata for job. Very recently in October 2019, a mosque (Masjid) namely Madina Masjid has been established in the village in the area of 25.5 dhur (2422 sq ft.) near the house of Mohammad Mustafa Ansari.\nSC caste people and Muslims are very poor and male members of the families migrate to big cities to find the jobs. There is a big open field about the size of football ground which is referred to as 'KOCHAR'. It is Bihar Government Gair Majarua Land used by local people for some festivals. The site is adjacent to Baya River which was once a mighty river overflowing with water particularly in Monsoon season. Few people from this village have ventured into fish farming and so one can see few artificial fish ponds at the western end of the village towards the Baya river. The main agricultural crops of this village are maize, tobacco, wheat, pulses,vegetables etc. Well off farmers rear cows and poor tend to rear goats for additional income and to better \nutilize the crop residue. The village is also particularly famous for one resident of the village who was wrestler known locally as 'Jila Keshri'. He was quite famous traditional wrestler of his time and in 1990s,the people were knowing village Gorgama due this person. \n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|25|04|N|87|36|E|display=title|region:IN_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Samastipur district]]\n\n{{Bihar-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:Masjid land site at Gorgama, Shahpur Patory, Samastipur|thumb|Madina Masjid land site, Gorgama, Shahpur Patory, Samastipur, Bihar in (photo taken on 3rd December 2019)]]\n[[File:Laying of foundation of Masjid at Gorgama Village(October 2019).jpg|thumb|Inauguration of Masjid (Mosque) work at Gorgama, Shahpur Patory, Samastipur, Bihar (October 2019)]]\n[[File:Another view of Masjid (Mosque) at Gorgama, Shahpur Patory, Samastipur (October 2019).jpg|thumb]]\n<gallery showfilename=\"yes\">\nFile:New Masjid (Madina Masjid) site.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=December 2010}}\n{{orphan|date=December 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Gorgama\n| native_name             = \n| native_name_lang        = \n| other_name              = \n| nickname                = \n| settlement_type         = village\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| pushpin_map             = <!--India Bihar-->\n| pushpin_label_position  = \n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Bihar, India\n| coordinates             = \n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Bihar]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2       = Samastipur\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title2           = <ref>[http://www.brandbihar.com/english/districts/samastipur/samastipur_patori_imansarai_gorgama%20purandar.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n| leader_name2            = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_rank               = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| population_total        = \n| population_as_of        = \n| population_rank         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      = \n| population_footnotes    = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = <!-- [[Postal Index Number|PIN]] -->\n| postal_code             = \n| registration_plate      = \n| website                 = \n| iso_code                = [[ISO 3166-2:IN|IN-BR]]\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Gorgama''' is a very small village in [[Samastipur District]], [[Bihar]] state, [[India]], near [[Shahpur Patory]].
