{"title_page": "Subset sum problem", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=December 2008}}vhjhhh\n\nIn [[computer science]], the '''subset sum problem''' is an important [[decision problem]] in [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[cryptography]]. There are several equivalent formulations of the problem. One of them is: given a set (or [[multiset]]) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero?  For example, given the set <math>\\{-7, -3, -2, 9000, 5, 8\\}</math>, the answer is ''yes'' because the subset <math>\\{-3, -2, 5\\}</math> sums to zero.  The problem is [[NP-complete]], meaning roughly that while it is easy to confirm whether a proposed solution is valid, it may inherently be prohibitively difficult to determine in the first place whether any solution exists.\n\nThe problem can be equivalently formulated as: given the integers or natural numbers <math>w_1,\\ldots,w_n</math> does any subset of them sum to precisely <math>W</math>?<ref name = \"kleinberg2006p491\">{{cite book|year=2006|edition=2nd|title=Algorithm Design|url=https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesign0000klei|url-access=registration|first1=Jon|last1=Kleinberg|first2=\u00c9va|last2=Tardos|isbn=0-321-37291-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesign0000klei/page/491 491]}}</ref> Subset sum can also be thought of as a special case of the [[knapsack problem]].<ref name=\"MartelloToth\">{{cite book|chapter=4 Subset-sum problem|pages=[https://archive.org/details/knapsackproblems0000mart/page/105 105\u2013136]|title=Knapsack problems: Algorithms and computer interpretations|last1=Martello|first1=Silvano|last2=Toth|first2=Paolo|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1990|isbn=0-471-92420-2|mr=1086874|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/knapsackproblems0000mart/page/105}}</ref>  One interesting special case of subset sum is the [[partition problem]], in which <math>W</math> is half of the sum of all elements in the set (i.e., <math> W = \\frac{1}{2}(w_1+\\dots+w_n)</math>).\n\n== Complexity ==\n\nThe [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the subset sum problem can be viewed as depending on two parameters, ''N'', the number of decision variables, and ''P'', the precision of the problem (stated as the number of binary place values that it takes to state the problem). (Note: here the letters ''N'' and ''P'' mean something different from what they mean in the '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' class of problems.)\n\nThe complexity of the best known algorithms is [[Exponential time|exponential]] in the smaller of the two parameters ''N'' and ''P''. Thus, the problem is most difficult if ''N'' and ''P'' are of the same order. It only becomes easy if either ''N'' or ''P'' becomes very small.\n\nIf ''N'' (the number of variables) is small, then an [[exhaustive search]] for the solution is practical. If ''P'' (the number of place values) is a small fixed number, then there are [[dynamic programming]] algorithms that can solve it exactly.\n\nEfficient algorithms for both small ''N'' and small ''P'' cases are given below.\n\n== Exponential time algorithm ==\n\nThere are several ways to solve subset sum in time exponential in <math>N</math>. The most [[naive solution|na\u00efve algorithm]] would be to cycle through all subsets of <math>N</math> numbers and, for every one of them, check if the subset sums to the right number. The running time is of order <math>O(2^NN)</math>, since there are <math>2^N</math> subsets and, to check each subset, we need to sum at most <math>N</math> elements.\n\nA better exponential time algorithm is known which runs in time <math>O(2^{N/2})</math>. The algorithm splits arbitrarily the <math>N</math> elements into two sets of <math>N/2</math> each. For each of these two sets, it stores a list of the sums of all <math>2^{N/2}</math> possible subsets of its elements. Each of these two lists is then sorted. Using a standard comparison sorting algorithm for this step would take time <math>O(2^{N/2}N)</math>.  However, given a sorted list of sums for <math>k</math> elements, the list can be expanded to two sorted lists with the introduction of a (<math>k+1</math>)th element, and these two sorted lists can be merged in time <math>O(2^k)</math>.  Thus, each list can be generated in sorted form in time <math>O(2^{N/2})</math>.  Given the two sorted lists, the algorithm can check if an element of the first array and an element of the second array sum up to <math>s</math> in time <math>O(2^{N/2})</math>. To do that, the algorithm passes through the first array in decreasing order (starting at the largest element) and the second array in increasing order (starting at the smallest element). Whenever the sum of the current element in the first array and the current element in the second array is more than <math>s</math>, the algorithm moves to the next element in the first array. If it is less than <math>s</math>, the algorithm moves to the next element in the second array. If two elements that sum to <math>s</math> are found, it stops.

Suppose the sequence is \n\n:<math>x_1,\\ldots, x_N</math>\n\nsorted in the increasing order and we wish to determine if there is a nonempty subset which sums to zero.

Clearly, <math>Q(i, s) = false</math>, if <math>s < A</math> or <math>s > B</math>.

Initially, for <math>A \\le s \\le B</math>, set\n\n:<math>Q(1, s) := (x_1 == s)</math>\n\nwhere <math>==</math> is a boolean function that returns true if <math>x_1</math> is equal to <math>s</math>, false otherwise.\n\nThen, for <math>i = 2,\\ldots, N</math>, set\n\n:<math>Q(i, s) := Q(i-1, s)</math> '''or''' <math>(x_i == s)</math> '''or''' <math>Q(i-1, s-x_i), for A \\le s \\le B</math>.\n\nFor each assignment, the values of <math>Q</math> on the right side are already known, either because they were stored in the table for the previous value of <math>i</math> or because <math>Q(i-1, s-x_i) = false</math> if <math>s-x_i < A</math> or <math>s-x_i > B</math>. Therefore, the total number of arithmetic operations is <math>O(N(B-A))</math>. For example, if all the values are <math>O(N^k)</math> for some <math>k</math>, then the time required is <math>O(N^{k+2})</math>.\n\nThis algorithm is easily modified to return the subset with sum 0 if there is one.\n\nThe dynamic programming solution has runtime of <math>O(sN)</math> where <math>s</math> is the sum we want to find in set of <math>N</math> numbers.

Then, the polynomial time algorithm for approximate subset sum becomes an exact algorithm with running time polynomial in <math>N</math> and <math>2^P</math> (i.e., exponential in <math>P</math>).\n\nThe algorithm for the approximate subset sum problem is as follows:\n\n initialize a list ''S'' to contain one element 0.\n \n '''for each''' ''i'' from 1 to ''N'' '''do'''\n     let ''T'' be a list consisting of ''x<sub>i</sub>'' + ''y'', for all ''y'' in ''S''\n     let ''U'' be the union of ''T'' and ''S''\n     sort ''U''\n     make ''S'' empty \n     let ''y'' be the smallest element of ''U'' \n     add ''y'' to ''S''\n     '''for each''' element ''z'' of ''U'' in increasing order '''do'''\n         // Trim the list by eliminating numbers close to one another\n         // and throw out elements greater than ''s''.\n         '''if''' ''y'' + ''cs''/''N'' < ''z'' \u2264 ''s'' '''then'''\n             ''y'' = ''z''\n             add ''z'' to ''S''\n \n '''if''' ''S'' contains a number between (1 \u2212 ''c'')''s'' '''and''' ''s'' '''then'''\n     return ''yes''\n '''else'''\n     return ''no''\n\nThe algorithm is polynomial time because the lists <math>S</math>, <math>T</math> and <math>U</math> always remain of size polynomial in <math>N</math> and <math>1/c</math> and, as long as they are of polynomial size, all operations on them can be done in polynomial time.

There are several equivalent formulations of the problem. One of them is: given a set (or [[multiset]]) of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero?  For example, given the set <math>\\{-7, -3, -2, 9000, 5, 8\\}</math>, the answer is ''yes'' because the subset <math>\\{-3, -2, 5\\}</math> sums to zero.  The problem is [[NP-complete]], meaning roughly that while it is easy to confirm whether a proposed solution is valid, it may inherently be prohibitively difficult to determine in the first place whether any solution exists.\n\nThe problem can be equivalently formulated as: given the integers or natural numbers <math>w_1,\\ldots,w_n</math> does any subset of them sum to precisely <math>W</math>?<ref name = \"kleinberg2006p491\">{{cite book|year=2006|edition=2nd|title=Algorithm Design|url=https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesign0000klei|url-access=registration|first1=Jon|last1=Kleinberg|first2=\u00c9va|last2=Tardos|isbn=0-321-37291-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesign0000klei/page/491 491]}}</ref> Subset sum can also be thought of as a special case of the [[knapsack problem]].<ref name=\"MartelloToth\">{{cite book|chapter=4 Subset-sum problem|pages=[https://archive.org/details/knapsackproblems0000mart/page/105 105\u2013136]|title=Knapsack problems: Algorithms and computer interpretations|last1=Martello|first1=Silvano|last2=Toth|first2=Paolo|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1990|isbn=0-471-92420-2|mr=1086874|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/knapsackproblems0000mart/page/105}}</ref>  One interesting special case of subset sum is the [[partition problem]], in which <math>W</math> is half of the sum of all elements in the set (i.e., <math> W = \\frac{1}{2}(w_1+\\dots+w_n)</math>).\n\n== Complexity ==\n\nThe [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of the subset sum problem can be viewed as depending on two parameters, ''N'', the number of decision variables, and ''P'', the precision of the problem (stated as the number of binary place values that it takes to state the problem). (Note: here the letters ''N'' and ''P'' mean something different from what they mean in the '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' class of problems.)\n\nThe complexity of the best known algorithms is [[Exponential time|exponential]] in the smaller of the two parameters ''N'' and ''P''. Thus, the problem is most difficult if ''N'' and ''P'' are of the same order. It only becomes easy if either ''N'' or ''P'' becomes very small.\n\nIf ''N'' (the number of variables) is small, then an [[exhaustive search]] for the solution is practical. If ''P'' (the number of place values) is a small fixed number, then there are [[dynamic programming]] algorithms that can solve it exactly.\n\nEfficient algorithms for both small ''N'' and small ''P'' cases are given below.\n\n== Exponential time algorithm ==\n\nThere are several ways to solve subset sum in time exponential in <math>N</math>. The most [[naive solution|na\u00efve algorithm]] would be to cycle through all subsets of <math>N</math> numbers and, for every one of them, check if the subset sums to the right number. The running time is of order <math>O(2^NN)</math>, since there are <math>2^N</math> subsets and, to check each subset, we need to sum at most <math>N</math> elements.\n\nA better exponential time algorithm is known which runs in time <math>O(2^{N/2})</math>. The algorithm splits arbitrarily the <math>N</math> elements into two sets of <math>N/2</math> each. For each of these two sets, it stores a list of the sums of all <math>2^{N/2}</math> possible subsets of its elements. Each of these two lists is then sorted. Using a standard comparison sorting algorithm for this step would take time <math>O(2^{N/2}N)</math>.  However, given a sorted list of sums for <math>k</math> elements, the list can be expanded to two sorted lists with the introduction of a (<math>k+1</math>)th element, and these two sorted lists can be merged in time <math>O(2^k)</math>.

Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 Pro is the first water-resistant OnePlus phone, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|10-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it opts to crop out from the wide sensor. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the depth camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 Pro is the first water-resistant OnePlus phone, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|10-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it opts to crop out from the wide sensor. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of new 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|www.oneplus.com/8}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-bef\n| before = [[OnePlus 7T|OnePlus 7T & 7T Pro]]\n}}\n{{S-ttl\n| title = OnePlus 8 & 8 Pro\n| years = 2020\n}}\n{{S-inc|recent\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{OnePlus|state=collapsed}}\n{{Android smartphones}}\n\n[[Category:OnePlus mobile phones]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) devices]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras]]\n", "name_user": "Ghostofakina", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDesign", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_8"}
