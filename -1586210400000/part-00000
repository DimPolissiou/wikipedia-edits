However, it was a critical battle for the future border of Virginia and West Virginia, ensuring Highland County remained in Confederate hands and that it would not eventually become part of the future state of West Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>. \n\n==Background==\nIn December, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces under [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward Johnson]] occupied the summit pass of Allegheny Mountain (roughly 4,400 feet above sea level)  to defend the  [[Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike]] that offered a point of access from the mountains of western Virginia into the strategic Shenandoah Valley. The occupation of the high mountain pass coincided with a bitter winter, with much suffering and disease among the Southern troops<ref>https://www.virginia.org/listings/HistoricSites/CampAlleghenyConfederateOutpost/</ref>. Early Union victories in the current area of West Virginia had solidified control in much of the western mountains of Virginia, emboldening a Union move to take the Staunton to Petersburg Pike<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Perhaps thinking that Confederate morale was low<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>, a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] force of 2,000 under [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Robert H. Milroy]] attacked Johnson and his 1,200 Confederates at sunrise on December 13.<ref name=\"ABPP\" /><ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nMilroy's advance and a Confederate scouting party had skirmished on December 12. The next morning, Milroy divided his troops into a two pronged attack to flank the Confederate camp. The first column advanced up the Staunton-Parkersburg Pike, engaging the Confederate right side for several hours before withdrawing. The second column arrived shortly after the withdrawal of the first column and attacked the Confederate left<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. \n\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting raged for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside slopes, fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy had posted a strong force in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to drive off. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" Finally, Milroy's troops were repulsed, and he retreated to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the conflict, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. \n\nIronically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to leave Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny with five regiments through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref><ref>http://www.civilwar.com/history/battles/battle-summaries-19937/148062-camp-alleghany.html</ref>. The snow was often knee deep. The toll on the Confederate troops was brutal. In March 18, 1862, prior to the subsequent [[Battle of McDowell]] in Highland County (May 8, 1862,) Johnson (by then promoted to General) had roughly 4,000 men stationed at Camp Allegheny in Pocahontas County, but his effective strength was only 2,784, as nearly 1,200 men were sick or unavailable<ref>http://www.shenandoahatwar.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/McDowell-Battlefield-Driving-Tour.pdf</ref>. After the Battle of Camp Allegheny, Johnson also knew that the post was vulnerable to being flanked, and believed that Shenandoah Mountain to the southeast was a more defensible position. Combined with the loss of men in the bitter mountain weather and the logistical challenges of keeping the remote mountain post effectively supplied, [[General Robert E. Lee]] agreed to let Johnson abandon the post in favor of Shenandoah Mountain on April 2, 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia, including the Battle of Camp Allegheny, were small by later standards but left and enduring footprint because those states that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia. Because of the Battle of Camp Allegheny, the state line between Virginia and West Virginia began and stopped at the Pocohantas and Highland County line.  Pocohantas County remained in Union Control, Highland County in Confederate hands. As a result, Highland County did not participate in the voting for secession to West Virginia, but continued to be part of the state of Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>.\n\nIn 1903, Ambrose Bierce wrote a column in The New York American about the visiting the battle site, entitled \"A Bivouac of the Dead<ref>http://www.online-literature.com/bierce/765/</ref>,\" recalling his involvement in the battle as a member of a Union regiment.

Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor.<ref name=Halberstam/> Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed.

While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the [[Albany Patroons]] to their first title in 1984. In Puerto Rico, he coached the [[Piratas de Quebradillas]] (1984 and 1987) and the [[Gallitos de Isabela]] (1984\u20131986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the [[counterculture]] during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.<ref name=\"Halberstam\"/>\n\n===Chicago Bulls (1987\u20131998)===\nIn 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]].

The \"three-peat\" was the first since the [[Boston Celtics]] won eight titles in a row from [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] through [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]].\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Michael Jordan]] (left) and Phil Jackson]]\nJackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. [[Michael Jordan]]'s first retirement after the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993 season]] marked the end of the first \"three-peat\", and although Jordan returned just before the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the [[1994\u201395 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]].\n\nDespite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], Jackson's eventual successor.<ref name=Halberstam/> After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref name=Halberstam/> Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.<ref>{{cite news|title=The head Bull rides off into the sunset|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/22/jackson_update/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=June 22, 1998}}</ref> However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the [[1999\u20132000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1999.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers (1999\u20132004)===\nJackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67\u201315 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the [[1999\u20132000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in a tough seven-game series and then won the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 NBA championship]] by beating the [[1999\u20132000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]].\n\nWith the talented superstar duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], the strong supporting cast of [[Glen Rice]], [[Derek Fisher]], [[Rick Fox]], [[Devean George]], [[A. C. Green]], [[Robert Horry]], and [[Brian Shaw]], and the assistance of former Bulls [[Horace Grant]], [[Ron Harper]], and [[John Salley]], Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], against the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[2001\u201302 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], adding up to his third [[three-peat]] as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n[[File:Phil Jackson coaching LAL.jpg|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching the Lakers]]\n\nHowever, injuries, weak bench play, and [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|full-blown public tension]] between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2003]] NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\nAfterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"[[triangle offense]]\", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring\". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nPrior to the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Lakers signed NBA star veterans [[Karl Malone]] and [[Gary Payton]], who had been franchise players for the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial for alleged sexual assault]], continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the [[2004 NBA Finals]] and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nOn June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423>[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.423</ref> Winter said Jackson announced at the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423/> Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss|Dr. Jerry Buss]] reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the [[2004\u201305 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] was the end of the \"Trifecta\" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.\n\nThat fall, Jackson released ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003\u201304 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nWithout Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and [[Lamar Odom]] forced the team out of contention, going 34\u201348 in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]], Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with [[bladder]] cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.\n\n===Return to the Lakers (2005\u20132011)===\n\nOn June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the [[triangle offense]], the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded [[2005\u201306 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who were led by eventual MVP winner [[Steve Nash]]. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3\u20131 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson 08.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson (right) in 2008, standing next to Lakers assistant coach [[Frank Hamblen]] (left).]]\nOn January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating [[Pat Riley]]'s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] through the end of the 2009\u20132010 season.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Lakers were able to obtain [[Pau Gasol]] in a trade with the [[2007\u201308 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]]. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the [[2008 NBA Finals]] against the [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. Boston went on to win the series 4\u20132, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the 2nd time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals.\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year's finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson.\n\nJackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]], defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], [[2008\u201309 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] 4\u20131, clinching Jackson's 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and [[Red Auerbach]].\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]]. They defeated the [[2009\u201310 Oklahoma City Thunder season|Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[2009\u201310 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], and [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in the playoffs before defeating the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in the [[2010 NBA Finals]], earning Jackson his 11th NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300617013|title=Bryant, Artest rally Lakers to 16th championship |date=June 17, 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010\u201311 season.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AgEulkIpjiJ1N3Saog.Z3rzYrYZ4?slug=ap-lakers-jackson Phil Jackson returning to coach Lakers next season] Yahoo!

In the churches that they served, his father generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor.<ref name=Halberstam/> Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed. Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, and went to a dance for the first time in college.<ref name=Halberstam /> Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister.\n\n==High school career==\nJackson attended high school in [[Williston, North Dakota]], where he played varsity basketball and led the team to two state titles.

Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the [[University of North Dakota]] in the spring of 1962, during Jackson's junior year of high school.<ref name=Halberstam/>\n\n==College career==\n\nBill Fitch successfully recruited Jackson to the [[University of North Dakota]], where he was a member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref name=Halberstam/><ref name=SAE>[http://www.sae.net/index.asp?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts Facts and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106124035/http://www.sae.net/index.asp?r=fraternity&sr=facts&ssr=facts |date=January 6, 2007 }}, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.</ref> Jackson did well there, helping the [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball|Fighting Sioux]] to third- and fourth-place finishes in the [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|NCAA Division II tournament]] in his sophomore and junior years ([[1965 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1965]] and [[1966 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1966]]).

While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense.<ref name=Halberstam/> Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in [[1972\u201373 NBA season|1973]]. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969\u201370 championship season due to [[spinal fusion]] surgery; however, he authored a book entitled ''Take It All'', a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run.\n\nSoon after the 1973 title, several key starters retired, creating an opening for Jackson in the starting lineup.<ref name=Halberstam/> In the [[1974\u201375 NBA season]], Jackson and the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]' [[Bob Dandridge]] shared the lead for total [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]], with 330 each.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1975_stats.html 1974\u201375 NBA Player Register], basketball-reference.com</ref> Jackson lived in [[Leonia, New Jersey]], during this time.<ref>Adamek, Steve; and Iannazzone, Al.

While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the [[Albany Patroons]] to their first title in 1984. In Puerto Rico, he coached the [[Piratas de Quebradillas]] (1984 and 1987) and the [[Gallitos de Isabela]] (1984\u20131986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the [[counterculture]] during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.<ref name=\"Halberstam\"/>\n\n===Chicago Bulls (1987\u20131998)===\nIn 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. He was promoted to [[head coach]] in 1989.

The \"three-peat\" was the first since the [[Boston Celtics]] won eight titles in a row from [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] through [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]].\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|150px|left|[[Michael Jordan]] (left) and Phil Jackson]]\nJackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. [[Michael Jordan]]'s first retirement after the [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u20131993 season]] marked the end of the first \"three-peat\", and although Jordan returned just before the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the [[1994\u201395 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]].\n\nDespite the Bulls' success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause's stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls' assistant coaches were, as was [[Tim Floyd]], then head coach at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]], Jackson's eventual successor.<ref name=Halberstam/> After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997\u201398 season only. Krause announced the signing by emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997\u201398 title. Jackson then told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side, to which Krause responded, \"I don't care if it's 82-and-0 this year, you're fucking gone.\"<ref name=Halberstam/> Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.\n\nAfter the Bulls' final title of the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]] era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again.<ref>{{cite news|title=The head Bull rides off into the sunset|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/22/jackson_update/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 9, 2011|date=June 22, 1998}}</ref> However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the [[1999\u20132000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1999.\n\n===Los Angeles Lakers (1999\u20132004)===\nJackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he did in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67\u201315 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the [[1999\u20132000 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]] in a tough seven-game series and then won the [[2000 NBA Finals|2000 NBA championship]] by beating the [[1999\u20132000 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]].\n\nWith the talented superstar duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], the strong supporting cast of [[Glen Rice]], [[Derek Fisher]], [[Rick Fox]], [[Devean George]], [[A. C. Green]], [[Robert Horry]], and [[Brian Shaw]], and the assistance of former Bulls [[Horace Grant]], [[Ron Harper]], and [[John Salley]], Jackson would lead the Lakers to two additional titles in [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]] and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], against the [[2000\u201301 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[2001\u201302 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], adding up to his third [[three-peat]] as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the [[2001\u201302 Sacramento Kings season|Sacramento Kings]].\n[[File:Phil Jackson coaching LAL.jpg|thumb|Phil Jackson coaching the Lakers]]\n\nHowever, injuries, weak bench play, and [[Shaq\u2013Kobe feud|full-blown public tension]] between Bryant and O'Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2003]] NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion [[2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]].\nAfterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson's \"[[triangle offense]]\", Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson's brand of basketball and subsequently called it \"boring\". In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson's patience enough that the \"Zen Master\" even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Laker management rejected the request.\n\nPrior to the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]], the Lakers signed NBA star veterans [[Karl Malone]] and [[Gary Payton]], who had been franchise players for the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant's [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial for alleged sexual assault]], continued public sniping between O'Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the [[2004 NBA Finals]] and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]], who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the [[NBA Finals]].\n\nOn June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6&nbsp;million to $12&nbsp;million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423>[[#lazenby2006|Lazenby 2006]], p.423</ref> Winter said Jackson announced at the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star]] break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned.<ref name=lazenby2006_p423/> Many fans attributed Jackson's departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss|Dr. Jerry Buss]] reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O'Neal, upon hearing General Manager [[Mitch Kupchak]]'s announcement of the team's willingness to trade O'Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant's wishes with the departure of Jackson. O'Neal's trade to the [[2004\u201305 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]] was the end of the \"Trifecta\" that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.\n\nThat fall, Jackson released ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul|The Last Season]]'', a book which describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003\u201304 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nWithout Jackson and O'Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and [[Lamar Odom]] forced the team out of contention, going 34\u201348 in [[2004\u201305 NBA season|2004\u201305]] and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]], Jackson's successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not relating to his past bout with [[bladder]] cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.\n\n===Return to the Lakers (2005\u20132011)===\n\nOn June 15, 2005, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the [[triangle offense]], the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant's regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded [[2005\u201306 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]], who were led by eventual MVP winner [[Steve Nash]]. It was the first time that Jackson's team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs. The Lakers jumped out to a 3\u20131 lead following a dramatic last second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson 08.jpg|thumb|left|Jackson (right) in 2008, standing next to Lakers assistant coach [[Frank Hamblen]] (left).]]\nOn January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating [[Pat Riley]]'s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] through the end of the 2009\u20132010 season.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, the Lakers were able to obtain [[Pau Gasol]] in a trade with the [[2007\u201308 Memphis Grizzlies season|Memphis Grizzlies]]. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the [[2008 NBA Finals]] against the [[2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]]. Boston went on to win the series 4\u20132, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the 2nd time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals.\n\nOn December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year's finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson.\n\nJackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]], defeating the [[2008\u201309 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], [[2008\u201309 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]], and [[2008\u201309 Denver Nuggets season|Denver Nuggets]] in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the [[2008\u201309 Orlando Magic season|Orlando Magic]] 4\u20131, clinching Jackson's 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and [[Red Auerbach]].\n\nOn February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]]. They defeated the [[2009\u201310 Oklahoma City Thunder season|Oklahoma City Thunder]], [[2009\u201310 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]], and [[2009\u201310 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in the playoffs before defeating the [[2009\u201310 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in the [[2010 NBA Finals]], earning Jackson his 11th NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300617013|title=Bryant, Artest rally Lakers to 16th championship |date=June 17, 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010\u201311 season.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AgEulkIpjiJ1N3Saog.Z3rzYrYZ4?slug=ap-lakers-jackson Phil Jackson returning to coach Lakers next season] Yahoo!

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 17 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of January 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award.

As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students.

They return to school, where Juno corners Haru and, after finding out they didn't have sex, challenges her for Legoshi's heart. The Meteorite Festival begins, but before Legoshi can confess to Haru, Juno brings him on stage and announces his heroism of saving a herbivore to the crowd, which applauds his bravery. She arranges to light a candle with him, to signify their relationship. Later, Legoshi leaves in search of Haru, who had trudged off believing that Juno would be better than her for Legoshi. Legoshi finds her and explains his feelings, but admits to her that he needs an unknown amount of time to get stronger so that he doesn't lose to his instincts, to which she replies that she will wait for him. Sometime later, Legoshi encounters an unseen character, who walks with him but begins smiling for no apparent reason.
