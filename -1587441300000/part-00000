The system opened in 1985 for the [[Expo 86]]. This original portion, now known as the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line]], is also joined by the [[Millennium Line|Millennium]] and [[Canada Line|Canada]] lines, making it Canada's longest by track length, at {{convert|79.6|km|abbr=on}}. The system serves Vancouvers and many of its surrounding municipalities in the [[Metro Vancouver Regional District]].\n*The [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|Expo Line]] is named after Expo 86, for which it was originally constructed. It connects [[Waterfront station (Vancouver)|Waterfront station]], an intermodal transit station in Downtown Vancouver, with [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. Since 2016, a second branch of the line connects to the Millennium Line in [[Burnaby]].<ref name=\"Evergreen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/vancouver/ |title=Vancouver SkyTrain, Canada |website=Railway-Technology.com |accessdate=2015-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.news1130.com/2016/12/02/evergreen-extension-opening-today/ |title=Evergreen Extension opening today |date=2016-12-02 |website=NEWS 1130|access-date=2016-12-02}}</ref>\n*The [[Millenium Line]] is named after the [[3rd millennium]] in which it was opened. Originally, it operated as a branch service of the Expo Line, following its alignment from Waterfront to [[Columbia station (SkyTrain)|Columbia station]], before branching off. The opening of the [[Evergreen Extension]] in 2016 brought its current alignment, running roughly east-west from [[VCC\u2013Clark station]] in Vancouver to [[Lafarge Lake\u2013Douglas station]] in [[Coquitlam]].<ref name=\"Evergreen\"/> An [[Millennium Line Broadway extension|additional extension]] is planned along [[Broadway (Vancouver)|Broadway]] to [[Arbutus station]].\n*The [[Canada Line]] was built in advance of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. It uses distinct technology from the rest of the system, and runs south from Waterfront station to the [[Vancouver International Airport|airport]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Canada|Trains}}\n\n* [[Bus rapid transit in Canada]]\n* [[Light rail in Canada]]\n* [[List of North American light rail systems by ridership]]\n* [[List of North American rapid transit systems by ridership]]\n* [[Transportation in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Canadian passenger rail systems}}\n\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Canada| ]]\n[[Category:Transport in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "UmpireRay", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eToronto:Fixed ref tag.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit_in_Canada"}
