A look at what causes emotional trauma, the families involved, and how therapy can heal the child as well as the adult are also important factors.\n\n==Reasons for Treatment==\nTraumatic events that affect children are seen in households where sexual, mental, or physical abuse is present. The inability to regulate self-emotions either directly or indirectly is a clinical sign that a traumatic event has affected the child. According to child psychiatrist Dr. Glenn Saxe, \u201cTST is a comprehensive model for treating traumatic stress in children and adolescents that adds to individually based approaches by specifically addressing the child\u2019s social environment and/or systems of care\u201d.<ref name=\"saxe-blog\"/> This may include children or adolescents having social problems in school or in their home secondary to rape, physical abuse, neglect, death of a caregiver and/or any significant life altering emotion trauma. Sexual, physical, or mental traumatic events can affect present, past memory, and the anticipated future. Saxe's theory in \u201cThe March of the Moments: Traumatic Stress in the Past, Present, and Future,\u201d begins with \u201csurvival-in-the-moment\u201d which causes severe emotions, unexplained personality changes, erratic behavior due to a sudden trigger that reminds the child of the event.<ref name=Saxe2007/>  Second, \u201cPast memory\u201d refers to \u201claying down of the present, conscious moments in the brain so that they can be accessible if we need them\u201d.<ref name=Saxe2007/> This causes significant long-term trauma because if a child is not able to understand what has happened to him or her in the past, then he or she will go through life with a band-aid on this wound instead of healing mentally and physically. Finally, \u201cmarching into the future\u201d refers to one of the most detrimental causes of traumatic stress, its effect on the child's ability to think into the future. Saxe states, \u201cIf consciousness is about the present, and memory is about the past, then planning and anticipation are about the future\u201d.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|40}} One's ability to see into the future is part of the human cognition, when a child starts to \u201ccalculate survival-related risk\u201d;<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|40}} this causes significant stress by continuously reliving the trauma. When a child or adolescent plans their future around what might happen, this never allows the cause of the problem to be resolved, insuring they will never mentally or emotional heal. In addition to the black and white causes of Traumatic Stress, there are also secondary causes that are directly related to these events. So TST not only addresses the event at hand but also the associated problems that come along with it.\n\n==Diagnosis/ Signs and Symptoms==\nThe treatment for TST is based on professional finding. PTSD is an umbrella diagnosis that includes many children and adolescents who show the basic problem of the inability to regulate their emotions.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|62}} When evaluating a child for TST, therapists look for awareness, affects, and actions when faced with a stressful event or unfamiliar situation.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|62}} Children who have been exposed to traumatic events show secondary symptoms such as the following: self modulation, self-destructive behavior, disassociation, feeling shameful, sadness, anger, hostility, social withdrawal, poor relationship skills, or changes in personality.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|63}} In many children, these symptoms can show up long after the event has occurred, during puberty or even the transition into adulthood.\n\nThere are three main groups used to categorize a child's trauma, starting with Awareness (elements of attention, sense of self, orientation);<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|65}} Affect (mood disorders, personality disorders); and Action (conduct disorders, personality, mood disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse).<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|65}} The disorders listed are usually first seen by family members, teachers, counselors, or other adults in the child's life. Children who show signs of depression may also be affected by some sort of PTSD and would benefit from TST. Once children are clinically depressed, they tend to show changes in their thinking about themselves, their view of the world and how they see the future.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|61}} We see the signs and symptom associated with the event spill over into the home life, social life, academics and extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, children haven't learned coping skills to deal with traumatic events. Instead, they act out or start the downward spiral to self-destruction. Understanding what to look for and recognizing this behavior in a child or adolescent is key to early detection and success.\n\n==Management==\nManagement of such intense emotional stress has to include the child affected, as well as his or her social surroundings. TST treats the home and proved community based care, provides a service advocacy, helps with emotional regulation skills training and uses psychopharmacology to treat patients.<ref name=saxe-blog>{{cite web|last=Saxe|first=Glenn N.|title=TST Basics|url=http://traumasystemstherapy.wordpress.com/|publisher=Trauma Systems Blog|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>  Knowledge of the child's trauma, what stage he or she is at in the recovery phase, and willingness to seek treatment is all part of the healing process for the child and his or her family.\n\nTherapy starts with the home environment. The caregiver has to understand the core problem by addressing if his or her child is sad a lot, destructive, or maybe the school keeps calling CPS (child protective services).<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|158}} Understanding why the child is acting in such a manner is crucial in the healing process. Treatment for family, teachers and social workers is done so all the adults are on the same page with the problem at hand; they understand the course for treatment and can all be tools for the child to use during TST.  Next, everyone in the child's life must become a service advocacy, which means holding \u201cFamily Collaborative Meetings\u201d.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|156}} This offers education and information to the adults so they know what to expect from TST. Dedication from the adults to meet at the scheduled times, have adequate transportation to therapy, ability to overcome language barriers, and put their children's needs before their own are all essential to success. Emotional regulation skills training is very important to therapy. The process starts with assessment, and then going through the course of treatment. Coping skills are stable and healthy ways to overcome stress and manage a child's emotions and emotional identification, giving the child tools so he or she can better deal with the strategies, and communication about feelings, emotions, fears and concerns.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|225}} This is especially important as children who experience trauma face a loss of emotional and mental control because of emotional numbing, flashbacks, and a higher probability for many mental health issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e416582005-007|title=NCTSN Activities: NCTSN Indian County Child Trauma Center Sponsors American Indian Training|date=2004|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref> An example of a coping technique that could be used is therapy through creating music.

A look at what causes emotional trauma, the families involved, and how therapy can heal the child as well as the adult are also important factors.\n\n==Reasons for Treatment==\nTraumatic events that affect children are seen in households where sexual, mental, or physical abuse is present. The inability to regulate self-emotions either directly or indirectly is a clinical sign that a traumatic event has affected the child. According to child psychiatrist Dr. Glenn Saxe, \u201cTST is a comprehensive model for treating traumatic stress in children and adolescents that adds to individually based approaches by specifically addressing the child\u2019s social environment and/or systems of care\u201d.<ref name=\"saxe-blog\"/> This may include children or adolescents having social problems in school or in their home secondary to rape, physical abuse, neglect, death of a caregiver and/or any significant life altering emotion trauma. Sexual, physical, or mental traumatic events can affect present, past memory, and the anticipated future. Saxe's theory in \u201cThe March of the Moments: Traumatic Stress in the Past, Present, and Future,\u201d begins with \u201csurvival-in-the-moment\u201d which causes severe emotions, unexplained personality changes, erratic behavior due to a sudden trigger that reminds the child of the event.<ref name=Saxe2007/>  Second, \u201cPast memory\u201d refers to \u201claying down of the present, conscious moments in the brain so that they can be accessible if we need them\u201d.<ref name=Saxe2007/> This causes significant long-term trauma because if a child is not able to understand what has happened to him or her in the past, then he or she will go through life with a band-aid on this wound instead of healing mentally and physically. Finally, \u201cmarching into the future\u201d refers to one of the most detrimental causes of traumatic stress, its effect on the child's ability to think into the future. Saxe states, \u201cIf consciousness is about the present, and memory is about the past, then planning and anticipation are about the future\u201d.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|40}} One's ability to see into the future is part of the human cognition, when a child starts to \u201ccalculate survival-related risk\u201d;<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|40}} this causes significant stress by continuously reliving the trauma. When a child or adolescent plans their future around what might happen, this never allows the cause of the problem to be resolved, insuring they will never mentally or emotional heal. In addition to the black and white causes of Traumatic Stress, there are also secondary causes that are directly related to these events. So TST not only addresses the event at hand but also the associated problems that come along with it.\n\n==Diagnosis/ Signs and Symptoms==\nThe treatment for TST is based on professional finding. PTSD is an umbrella diagnosis that includes many children and adolescents who show the basic problem of the inability to regulate their emotions.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|62}} When evaluating a child for TST, therapists look for awareness, affects, and actions when faced with a stressful event or unfamiliar situation.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|62}} Children who have been exposed to traumatic events show secondary symptoms such as the following: self modulation, self-destructive behavior, disassociation, feeling shameful, sadness, anger, hostility, social withdrawal, poor relationship skills, or changes in personality.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|63}} In many children, these symptoms can show up long after the event has occurred, during puberty or even the transition into adulthood.\n\nThere are three main groups used to categorize a child's trauma, starting with Awareness (elements of attention, sense of self, orientation);<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|65}} Affect (mood disorders, personality disorders); and Action (conduct disorders, personality, mood disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse).<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|65}} The disorders listed are usually first seen by family members, teachers, counselors, or other adults in the child's life. Children who show signs of depression may also be affected by some sort of PTSD and would benefit from TST. Once children are clinically depressed, they tend to show changes in their thinking about themselves, their view of the world and how they see the future.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|61}} We see the signs and symptom associated with the event spill over into the home life, social life, academics and extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, children haven't learned coping skills to deal with traumatic events. Instead, they act out or start the downward spiral to self-destruction. Understanding what to look for and recognizing this behavior in a child or adolescent is key to early detection and success.\n\n==Management==\nManagement of such intense emotional stress has to include the child affected, as well as his or her social surroundings. TST treats the home and proved community based care, provides a service advocacy, helps with emotional regulation skills training and uses psychopharmacology to treat patients.<ref name=saxe-blog>{{cite web|last=Saxe|first=Glenn N.|title=TST Basics|url=http://traumasystemstherapy.wordpress.com/|publisher=Trauma Systems Blog|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>  Knowledge of the child's trauma, what stage he or she is at in the recovery phase, and willingness to seek treatment is all part of the healing process for the child and his or her family.\n\nTherapy starts with the home environment. The caregiver has to understand the core problem by addressing if his or her child is sad a lot, destructive, or maybe the school keeps calling CPS (child protective services).<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|158}} Understanding why the child is acting in such a manner is crucial in the healing process. Treatment for family, teachers and social workers is done so all the adults are on the same page with the problem at hand; they understand the course for treatment and can all be tools for the child to use during TST.  Next, everyone in the child's life must become a service advocacy, which means holding \u201cFamily Collaborative Meetings\u201d.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|156}} This offers education and information to the adults so they know what to expect from TST. Dedication from the adults to meet at the scheduled times, have adequate transportation to therapy, ability to overcome language barriers, and put their children's needs before their own are all essential to success. Emotional regulation skills training is very important to therapy. The process starts with assessment, and then going through the course of treatment. Coping skills are stable and healthy ways to overcome stress and manage a child's emotions and emotional identification, giving the child tools so he or she can better deal with the strategies, and communication about feelings, emotions, fears and concerns.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|225}} Finally, psychopharmacology is medication used to help a person's emotional state. To reach the best therapeutic effect for a child, all of these concepts have to be integrated. The medication approach starts with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors); these help with anxiety, depression and impulsivity.<ref name=Saxe2007/>{{rp|212}} The second-line medications are Benzodiazepines, Tricyclic antidepressants and Antipsychotic medication. These are very strong and are used as a last-ditch effort to prevent a child from having severe emotional problems. Occasionally, sleeping medication is prescribed but all are under careful supervision for harmful side effects.

Cedar Fair began removing references to [[Paramount Pictures]] Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee. All references to Paramount/CBS-licensed properties were removed before the beginning of the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Economy/2006/05/23/Cedar-Point-s-parent-firm-buys-5-additional-parks-for-1-24-billion.html|publisher=Toledo Blade|author=Jon Chavez|title=Cedar Point's parent firm buys 5 additional parks for $1.24 billion|date=May 23, 2006|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009 it was announced that [[Apollo Global Management]] would offer Cedar Fair $11.50<ref name=\"Cedar-Fair-Dec-2009-8-K\">{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/707/90951809000914/filing-main.htm |title=Cedar Fair, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Dec 17, 2009 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Mar 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"takeover\">{{cite web\n |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2011535721_apusapollocedarfair.html\n |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130031555/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2011535721_apusapollocedarfair.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=30 January 2013\n |title=Cedar Fair:  Takeover not happening \n |date=6 April 2010 \n |publisher=The Seattle Times \n |accessdate=19 November 2011 \n}}\n</ref> per share, a 28 percent premium over the market price, as part of a takeover plan which would also make Cedar Fair a private company.<ref name=\"Apollo acquisition\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2009/12/cedar_fair_expected_to_be_boug.html|title=Cedar Fair to be acquired by New York private-equity firm|last=Samavati|first=Shaheen|date=16 December 2009|publisher=Cleveland.com|accessdate=19 November 2011}}\n</ref> The deal included a cash payment of $635 million in addition to assuming Cedar Fair's debt of over US$1.7 billion putting the total value of the transaction close to US$2.4 billion.
