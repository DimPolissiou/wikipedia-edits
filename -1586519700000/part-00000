During the 1880s, they observed bacteria by microscopy in skin samples from people with acne. Investigators believed the bacteria caused comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne.<ref name=Tilles2014/> During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) fully accounted for the disease in its entirety.<ref name=Tilles2014/> This led to the current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.<ref name=Tilles2014/>\n\nThe approach to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century.

Economic freedom is consistent with that proud history and provides a path to a more prosperous and freer tomorrow. Economic freedom is simply the ability of individuals and families to take charge of their fate and make their own economic decisions\u2014to sell or buy in the marketplace without discrimination, to open or close a business, to work for whom they wish or hire whom they wish, to receive investment or invest in others.\n\nAl Ismaily was named the \"Man of the Year\" in 2015 at the Arab Liberty Festival in [[Marrakesh|Marrakesh, Morocco]].\n\nHe was honoured for his exceptional professional and academic contribution to the understanding of free enterprise in the Arab world, and to public policies that encourage prosperity, innovation and human fulfillment.\n\nAl Ismaily has published several papers on the subject of cross culture, management and economy including five books on corporate culture, history and religion.\n\n=== The release of the American hikers imprisoned in Iran ===\n[[File:Dr. Salem Al-Ismaily with Hassan Rouhani and Sultan Qaboos.png|thumb|Dr. Salem Al-Ismaily with President [[Hassan Rouhani]] and [[Qaboos bin Said al Said|Sultan Qaboos bin Said]]]]\nAmericans Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were released in September 2011, after being held in [[Tehran]]'s Evin Prison for 26 months.

A high-level delegation from Oman made the pledge during talks with President [[John Magufuli]], said the statement.\n\nThe delegation arrived in [[Dar es Salaam]] port on Tuesday 17 October 2017, aboard a ship christened ''Fulk Al Salamah''. They aimed at strengthening the Tanzania-Oman relationship, especially on the economic front.  For his part, President [[John Magufuli|Magufuli]], apart from thanking the Omani royal government for its commitment, pledged continued cooperation.\n[[File:Dr. Ali Shein, the President of Zanzibar with the Omani Delegation.jpg|thumb|Dr. Ali Shein, the President of Zanzibar with the Omani Delegation]]\nThe president said Tanzania was ready to create conducive environment for investments by giving investors necessary support. He asked the government of Oman to strengthen its relationship with Tanzania on tourism, fishing and aviation sectors as well as construction of meat processing industries, and exchange programs for experts in [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] and [[Arabic]] languages. Magufuli also thanked the Omani government for the construction of 100 water wells across the country and asked for more investments in the new capital city of [[Dodoma Region|Dodoma]] in central Tanzania.\n\n== Writing ==\nAl-Ismaily is instrumental in promoting trade relations between Oman and the [[United States]].\n\nHe has written several books, one of which, ''Inside the Omani Corporate Culture \u2013 A Research in Management Styles'', co-authored with Professor Peter McKiernan of the [[University of St Andrews]], is the academic foundation of this story. Richard Tzudiker{{who|date=December 2018}} is a freelance writer with a bachelor's degree in English from [[Colgate University]] and a master's degree in business administration from the [[University of Denver]]. He spent half his childhood in Europe and most of his professional career with multinational minerals companies. He is currently an investment and trust account administrator at a community bank in [[Colorado]].\nIn his efforts on promoting cultural dialogue, Al-Ismaily met with Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II met in Muscat to discuss issues of cultural and religious exchanges in which they spoke about the history of religions, especially that of Syriac Orthodox Church and its presence in Oman. The discussions took place in the presence of Mor Clemis Daniel Kourieh, Metropolitan of Beirut, Raban Joseph Bali, Patriarchal Secretary and Media Office Director <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://syriacpatriarchate.org/2018/05/meeting-with-his-excellency-dr-salem-ben-nasser-al-ismaily/|title=Meeting with His Excellency Dr. Salem Ben Nasser Al-Ismaily|date=2018-05-10|work=Syrian Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}</ref> \n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat|Salem Ben Nasser Al-Ismaily}}\n* {{cite web|title=Sultanate of Oman: One of most economically free countries in the world|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=61460|publisher=www.middle-east-online.com|accessdate=29 July 2016}}\n* {{cite news|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The Omani \u2018back channel\u2019 to Iran and the secrecy surrounding the nuclear deal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-omani-back-channel-to-iran-and-the-secrecy-surrounding-the-nuclear-deal/2016/06/07/0b9e27d4-2ce1-11e6-b5db-e9bc84a2c8e4_story.html|accessdate=29 July 2016|publisher=The Washington Post|date=7 June 2016}}\n* {{cite web|title=David Ignatius: The Omani backchannel to Iran|url=http://www.journalnow.com/opinion/columnists/david-ignatius-the-omani-backchannel-to-iran/article_3f49372c-d6a6-5287-8b91-f33b9d77d7a9.html|publisher=www.journalnow.com|accessdate=29 July 2016}}\n* {{cite web|title=Ithraa to lead trade team of 14 Omani firms to India|url=http://timesofoman.com/article/64778/Business/Economy/Ithraa-to-lead-trade-team-of-14-Omani-firms-to-India|publisher=Times Of Oman|accessdate=29 July 2016}}\n* {{cite news|last1=Landler|first1=Mark|title=For Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Divergent Paths to Iran Nuclear Talks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/us/politics/for-hillary-clinton-and-john-kerry-divergent-paths-to-iran-nuclear-talks.html?_r=0|accessdate=29 July 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 May 2016}}\n* {{cite news|title=The Daily 202: Primary wins show Hillary Clinton needs the left less than pro-Sanders liberals think|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/06/08/daily-202-primary-wins-show-hillary-clinton-needs-the-left-less-than-pro-sanders-liberals-think/5757867a981b92a22deb72ee/|accessdate=29 July 2016|publisher=Washington Post}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ismaily, Salem Ben Nasser}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Omani businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Omani writers]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Ithraaoman", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_Ben_Nasser_Al-Ismaily"}

The core societal benefits that have emerged out of the new empirical research on the phenomenon are two-fold: it has helped people with this condition to better understand why they have it and it has served to educate the rest of the population that it is a real and legitimate condition that significantly impacts the lives of many around the world.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n[[Category:Music psychology]]\n", "name_user": "188.126.128.109", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_anhedonia"}

Baldwin owned a general store named T. Baldwin and Sons. He also had a hotel at what would now be considered the northwest corner of Merrick Road and Grand Avenue.

In 1870, one of Thomas Baldwin's sons, Francis Baldwin, became a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] representing Queens County's 2nd District; he later served as the Queens County treasurer.<ref name=\"Baldwin History\"/> (During this time, Baldwinsville was part of [[Queens County, New York|Queens County]].) A year later, the name of the village was changed from Baldwinsville to Baldwins by the [[U.S. Postal Service]] so as to not confuse it with the village of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]] in upstate New York. By 1892, by an act of local government, the village was officially named Baldwin.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nShortly after Hempstead separated from Queens County in 1899, people began to move to \"Beautiful Baldwin\", as it was called by Charles Luerssen, a village realtor. The village had fine boating (sailboats), bathing, and fishing. By 1939, ten years after the opening of [[New York State Route 27|Sunrise Highway]], Baldwin became the largest unincorporated village in New York State\u2014a title that was lost to [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] by 1960.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nIn the 1990 US Census, the area south of Atlantic Avenue was designated as Baldwin Harbor, a hamlet (and census-designated place). Baldwin Harbor remains a part of the Town of Baldwin's ZIP code, school district, and library system.\n\nIn May 1910, a breakthrough in American aviation history was made in Baldwin.  The first all-American [[monoplane]] was designed, built, and successfully flown at this location by brothers Arthur and Albert Heinrich. The project was developed at the site now occupied by the Plaza Elementary School on Seaman Avenue and Rockville Drive. In the plane's initial and subsequent models, its unique designs featured controls that were combined into one stick, which allowed the pilot to fly the plane using one hand.\n\n==Geography==\nThe community is located in the southwest part of Nassau County.

The boundaries of the Baldwin School District are not identical with those of Baldwin itself, also containing the Stearns Park neighborhood of [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], up to Knollwood Road in [[Rockville Centre]] (which is a few blocks away from South Side High School) and a few blocks from other neighboring villages. A small portion of Baldwin, located to the West of Silver Lake, is included in the [[Oceanside, New York|Oceanside]] Union Free School District.\n\nAs of September 2012, the Baldwin Public Schools consist of seven schools with a total enrollment of approximately 5500 students. There is one [[High school (North America)|high school]], [[Baldwin Senior High School (Baldwin, New York)|Baldwin Senior High School]], and one [[middle school]], [[Baldwin Middle School]]. There are five [[Primary education|elementary schools]] spaced throughout the town: Brookside, Lenox, Meadow, Plaza, and Steele.\n\nBaldwin Senior High School is a Nationally Recognized School of Excellence, and as of 2011, is the eighth-largest high school in Nassau County, New York.<ref>Baldwin UFSD Website</ref>  Baldwin Senior High School was ranked by ''Newsweek'' in its annual list of America's Best High Schools.  In 2010, it was ranked #837 in the entire United States, #804 in 2008, #971 in 2007, and #602 in 2006.<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/americas-best-high-schools/list.html</ref>  The high school offers a multitude of extracurricular clubs, varsity sports, and a robotics team.  Baldwin Senior High School offers Advanced Placement courses that may enable students to earn college credit, and the school produced two National Merit Commended Students, who achieved scores in the top 5% of the more than 1.5 million students who took the PSAT in 2009.\n\nThe high school is located near the north-central part of town, and the middle school near the south end. [[school bus|Buses]] are run to both of these schools. Most students are able to walk to their elementary schools. The elementary schools contain kindergarten to fifth grade. The middle school contains grades six through eight\u2014but the sixth graders spend most of their time in a separate wing except for music, gym, lunch, arts, computers, technology, and language. The high school contains grades nine through twelve.\n\nThree former elementary schools were closed in June 1980: Prospect School was torn down, along with the former Baldwin Junior High School and former Baldwin Senior High School which were combined in one building in the 1980s to make way for a housing complex; Coolidge School on Grand Avenue has been converted to condominiums; Harbor Elementary School on Hastings Street is now the school district office building. Two additional elementary schools, Milburn and Shubert, were closed in June 2012 as the result of enrollment changes and cuts in state funding.\n\nThe district is governed by a five-member elected [[board of education]]. Dr. Shari Camhi is the superintendent of schools.\n\nBaldwin also has one [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school, St. Christopher's. This school was established in 1925 as part of St. Christopher's parish. The school serves students from Baldwin, Freeport, and surrounding areas, and it ranges from kindergarten to eighth grade. Although originally staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, most of the school's faculty consists of lay people. Originally the school was one building that housed all classes, however it has been expanded twice. The school now consists of the \"original building\" (now housing classrooms, a gym, stage, computer lab, and music room), the \"middle building\" (housing the school and religious education offices, classrooms and an art room), and the \"new building\" (housing a cafeteria, library, and classrooms). Over the years the school has gained a highly regarded reputation in the Baldwin community. Students from the school participate in a wide variety of both Catholic and community events. For example, students take religion classes from kindergarten to the eighth grade, as well as march in the Baldwin Memorial Day Parade and help out at Baldwin's Big Sweep (a community event in which volunteers clean up Grand Avenue).\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Bob Beckwith]], FDNY veteran, stood next to President [[George W.

While in the landing zone, Kedenberg directed the defense of the L-Z and ultimately gave up the last chance of evacuation to one of his Vietnamese comrades.\n\n==Recreation==\nBaldwin is home to many public parks, including Baldwin Park, Coes Neck Park, Baldwin Skate Park (located within Baldwin Park), Lofts Pond Park, and Silver Lake Park which is in Oceanside also.  Baldwin Park, located at the southern terminus of Grand Avenue in Baldwin Harbor, is run by the Town of Hempstead, and offers a multitude of recreational facilities, including basketball, handball, paddleball, tennis, volleyball, spray pool, soccer, softball, baseball, playground, game tables, play equipment, sitting area, shuffleboard, bike paths, roller rink and Baldwin Skate Park.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Baldwin, New York}}\n* [http://www.baldwin.k12.ny.us Baldwin Union Free School District]\n* [http://www.baldwinfd.org Baldwin Volunteer Fire Department]\n* [http://www.hoseonebfd.org Hose Company One - Baldwin Fire Department]\n* [http://www.baldwinpal.org Nassau County Police Activity League - Baldwin Unit]\n* [http://www.baldwinhistoricalsociety.com Baldwin Historical Society & Museum]\n* [http://www.longisland.com/parks/ Long Island Parks]\n*[https://www.nassaucountyny.gov/3237/Baldwin Baldwin Veterans Recognition Program]\n\n{{HempsteadNY}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Census-designated places in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Hamlets in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Hempstead, New York]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Hamlets in Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1855]]\n[[Category:1855 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Baldwin, New York\n|settlement_type          = [[Hamlet (New York)|Hamlet]] and [[census-designated place]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = \n|pushpin_map              = New York\n|pushpin_label_position   = right\n|image_map                = Nassau County New York incorporated and unincorporated areas Baldwin highlighted.svg\n|mapsize                  = 260px\n|map_caption              = Location in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] and the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = {{flag|United States}}\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = {{flag|New York}}\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in New York|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = \n|leader_name              = \n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = \n|established_date         = 1855\n|area_footnotes           = \n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = \n|area_land_km2            = \n|area_water_km2           = \n|area_total_sq_mi         = \n|area_land_sq_mi          = \n|area_water_sq_mi         =\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_total         = 24033\n|population_density_km2   = auto\n|population_density_sq_mi =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = 7.0104\n|elevation_ft             = 23\n|coordinates              = {{coord|40|40|12.8|N|73|36|45|W|region:US_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 11510\n|area_code                = [[Area code 516|516]]\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 942888\n|website                  = [http://www.baldwinchamber.com http://www.baldwinchamber.com]\n}}\n[[Image:Baldwin-ny-map.gif|thumb|250px|U.S. Census map]]\n'''Baldwin''' is a [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] and [[census-designated place]] (CDP) located in the town of [[Hempstead (town), New York|Hempstead]] in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.

By 1892, by an act of local government, the village was officially named Baldwin.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nShortly after Hempstead separated from Queens County in 1899, people began to move to \"Beautiful Baldwin\", as it was called by Charles Luerssen, a village realtor. The village had fine boating (sailboats), bathing, and fishing. By 1939, ten years after the opening of [[New York State Route 27|Sunrise Highway]], Baldwin became the largest unincorporated village in New York State\u2014a title that was lost to [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] by 1960.<ref name=\"baldwinchamber.com\"/>\n\nIn the 1990 US Census, the area south of Atlantic Avenue was designated as Baldwin Harbor, a hamlet (and census-designated place). Baldwin Harbor remains a part of the Town of Baldwin's ZIP code, school district, and library system.\n\nIn May 1910, a breakthrough in American aviation history was made in Baldwin.  The first all-American [[monoplane]] was designed, built, and successfully flown at this location by brothers Arthur and Albert Heinrich. The project was developed at the site now occupied by the Plaza Elementary School on Seaman Avenue and Rockville Drive. In the plane's initial and subsequent models, its unique designs featured controls that were combined into one stick, which allowed the pilot to fly the plane using one hand.\n\n==Geography==\nThe community is located in the southwest part of Nassau County.

The boundaries of the Baldwin School District are not identical with those of Baldwin itself, also containing the Stearns Park neighborhood of [[Freeport, New York|Freeport]], up to Knollwood Road in [[Rockville Centre]] (which is a few blocks away from South Side High School) and a few blocks from other neighboring villages. A small portion of Baldwin, located to the West of Silver Lake, is included in the [[Oceanside, New York|Oceanside]] Union Free School District.\n\nAs of September 2012, the Baldwin Public Schools consist of seven schools with a total enrollment of approximately 5500 students. There is one [[High school (North America)|high school]], [[Baldwin Senior High School (Baldwin, New York)|Baldwin Senior High School]], and one [[middle school]], [[Baldwin Middle School]]. There are five [[Primary education|elementary schools]] spaced throughout the town: Brookside, Lenox, Meadow, Plaza, and Steele.\n\nBaldwin Senior High School is a Nationally Recognized School of Excellence, and as of 2011, is the eighth-largest high school in Nassau County, New York.<ref>Baldwin UFSD Website</ref>  Baldwin Senior High School was ranked by ''Newsweek'' in its annual list of America's Best High Schools.  In 2010, it was ranked #837 in the entire United States, #804 in 2008, #971 in 2007, and #602 in 2006.<ref>http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/americas-best-high-schools/list.html</ref>  The high school offers a multitude of extracurricular clubs, varsity sports, and a robotics team.  Baldwin Senior High School offers Advanced Placement courses that may enable students to earn college credit, and the school produced two National Merit Commended Students, who achieved scores in the top 5% of the more than 1.5 million students who took the PSAT in 2009.\n\nThe high school is located near the north-central part of town, and the middle school near the south end. [[school bus|Buses]] are run to both of these schools. Most students are able to walk to their elementary schools. The elementary schools contain kindergarten to fifth grade. The middle school contains grades six through eight\u2014but the sixth graders spend most of their time in a separate wing except for music, gym, lunch, arts, computers, technology, and language. The high school contains grades nine through twelve.\n\nThree former elementary schools were closed in June 1980: Prospect School was torn down, along with the former Baldwin Junior High School and former Baldwin Senior High School which were combined in one building in the 1980s to make way for a housing complex; Coolidge School on Grand Avenue has been converted to condominiums; Harbor Elementary School on Hastings Street is now the school district office building. Two additional elementary schools, Milburn and Shubert, were closed in June 2012 as the result of enrollment changes and cuts in state funding.\n\nThe district is governed by a five-member elected [[board of education]]. Dr. Shari Camhi is the superintendent of schools.\n\nBaldwin also has one [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] school, St. Christopher's. This school was established in 1925 as part of St. Christopher's parish. The school serves students from Baldwin, Freeport, and surrounding areas, and it ranges from kindergarten to eighth grade. Although originally staffed by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, most of the school's faculty consists of lay people. Originally the school was one building that housed all classes, however it has been expanded twice. The school now consists of the \"original building\" (now housing classrooms, a gym, stage, computer lab, and music room), the \"middle building\" (housing the school and religious education offices, classrooms and an art room), and the \"new building\" (housing a cafeteria, library, and classrooms). Over the years the school has gained a highly regarded reputation in the Baldwin community. Students from the school participate in a wide variety of both Catholic and community events. For example, students take religion classes from kindergarten to the eighth grade, as well as march in the Baldwin Memorial Day Parade and help out at Baldwin's Big Sweep (a community event in which volunteers clean up Grand Avenue).\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Bob Beckwith]], FDNY veteran, stood next to President [[George W.
