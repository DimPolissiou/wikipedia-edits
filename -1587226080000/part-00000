The idea was conceived as a result of a study visit to Ceylon in 1951 (now Sri Lanka) to look into its rural development programme. A resulting working paper outlined the establishment of [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat|Rural and Industrial Development Authority]] (RIDA) and its objectives of rebuilding the rural society, as well as improving the economy of rural Malays.<ref name=\"UiTM History\">{{cite web|url=https://www.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/about-uitm/others/historical-development|title=Historical Development|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=Universiti Teknologi MARA|access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref> A bill Paper No. 10/1951 was passed by the [[Federal Legislative Council]] on the same year that led to its establishment; reveals an interesting insight into the connection between RIDA Training Centre and the Malay community. Section 5 of this paper outlines the justification and the necessity of establishing Rural Industrial Development Authority (RIDA). The word ''kampong'' ({{lang-en|village}}), which is synonymous with the Malays, is also used in Section 8 of the paper.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ganti Shaari |first=Mohd Nazim |date= |title=Wither the Bumiputera Identity of UiTM? |url=http://web.usm.my/km/29(2)2011/Art4_KM29-2.pdf |journal=Journal of Malaysian Studies |publisher=Universiti Sains Malaysia |volume= 29 |issue=2 |pages=67\u201389 |doi= |access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Training Centre===\nIn November 1956, RIDA Training Centre began operations in [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Selangor]] (currently Jalan Othman satellite campus) under its first principal, Syed Alwi Syed Sheikh Alhadi. It was officially opened by Dr [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]], the Minister for Trade and Industry on 14 February 1957. The training centre conducted pre-university courses, business skills training and several external professional courses offered by established international bodies, such as the [[London Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Governance Institute of Australia|Australian Chartered Secretaryship]], the [[CPA Australia|Australian Society of Accountants]] and the [[British Institute of Management]]. After the formation of the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, the training centre began to admit native students from [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], and more academic programmes were offered. In 1964, RIDA Training Centre held its first convocation and 50 graduates were awarded certificates by [[Tun Abdul Razak]], the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\n[[File:Dewan Latehan Rida 1956.jpg|thumb|Dewan Latehan Rida 1956|The first batch of ''Dewan Latehan Rida'' students in Jalan Othman campus circa 1956.]]\nThe training centre later became known as MARA College ({{lang-ms|Maktab MARA}}) in 1965. The name change meant that the college no longer operated under RIDA and instead became the most important unit of the MARA Training Division. MARA stands for ''[[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]]'' ({{lang-en|Council of Trust for the Indigenous People}}) under the leadership of Tan Sri Arshad Ayub, took over and strengthened the role and responsibilities of RIDA. In 1966, when the British Institute of Management ceased conducting external examinations, MARA College began running its own Diploma in Business Studies. International recognition for the course came from [[University of West London|Ealing Technical College]] in London, which also became its external examiner.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n[[File:Logo Institut Teknologi MARA (ITM).png|160px|left|thumb|The logo of MARA Institute Of Technology ({{lang-ms|Institut Teknologi MARA, ITM}}) from 1967 until 1999.]]\n\n===Expansion and growth===\nIn 1967, the college was upgraded to [https://www.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/about-uitm/others/historical-development?start=1 Institut Teknologi MARA]. Its establishment came as a response to a need in Malaysia for trained professionals, especially among ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputeras]]''. This shortage was identified through a manpower survey conducted by the government in 1965 collaboration with the [[United Nations]]. Acknowledging the fact that education holds the key to positive social engineering processes, ITM has made education easily accessible primarily to the ''bumiputera'' Malays and indigenous ''bumiputera'' of the Malay peninsula (such as [[Jakun people|Jakun]], [[Senoi]]), and those from the [[East Malaysia]] (such as the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], [[Melanau]], and [[Dayak people|Dayak]]).<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Muhammad |first=Ahmad Mazli |date=2007 |title=The Effectiveness of an Academic Reading Course in Facilitating Tertiary Students' Comprehension of Academic Texts |type=Ph.D |chapter=The History of UiTM |publisher=Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia |chapter-url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/359/11360667.pdf |access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref> It mainly catered to semi-professional courses predominantly in the science and technology in fields such as engineering, applied sciences and architecture, building and planning. However, realising the importance of other complementary nation-building fields, it has also included a repertoire of other salient 'management and humanities-based' fields such as business studies, hotel and catering management, mass communications, public administration, law, secretarial science, as well as art and design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Abu Talib |date=15 December 2014 |title=Museums, History and Culture in Malaysia |edition=1st |publisher=[[NUS Press]] |isbn=978-9971698195}}</ref> By 1973, branch campuses had been set up in [[Perlis]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. The development of ITM was in three stages. The first phase (1967-1976) came with the declaration of the institute as an autonomous body with its own 300-acre campus in [[Shah Alam]], and was placed under the Ministry of Rural Development. The second phase (1976-1996) saw ITM rapidly harnessing its potential as an institution of higher learning. It led to the passing of the ITM Act of 1976 that placed the institute directly under the Ministry of Education.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\n===University status===\nThe third phase (1996-1999) came about as a result of an amendment to the ITM Act 1976 which granted the institution all the powers of a university and on par with all the universities in the country, despite retaining its name. Among the significant change was a creation of Board of Directors and Senate. Many principal officers of ITM were re-designated such as the Branch Director was renamed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]], the Head of Campus became the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], while Principal and Senior Lecturers were re-designated as [[Professors]] and Malay Associate Professors, respectively; each School was redesignated as a Faculty; ITM was given the power to confer degrees up to [[Doctor of Philosophy]] level; ITM was given the unique power to establish courses and campuses abroad with permission from the Minister of Education; the Institute was conferred additional powers to enable it to conduct business, invest in shares, set up companies and engage in commercial research; disciplinary powers over staff were transferred from the Minister to the Board of Directors; to improve staff accountability, the Institute was bestowed the power to impose a surcharge; and the procedural rights of students in disciplinary proceedings were strengthened.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\nIn August 1999, the [[Mahathir Mohamad|Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad]] announced the change in name of ITM to Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://me-kono.eu/institutions/universiti-teknologi-mara-uitm|title=Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)|publisher=Me'kono |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> With such acknowledgement from the government, a major restructuring exercise was carried out in order to consolidate the University's resources for optimum productivity. The ''Universiti Teknologi MARA'' Act 173 was drafted in conjunction with the establishment of UiTM. It is deemed essential as the Act provides guidelines for maintenance and smooth administration as well as other pertaining matters. The Act also serves as an acknowledgement of the institution\u2019s transition from an institute to a university, and the authority bestowed upon it to function like any other university. This includes the offering of courses of studies and the conferment of degrees at all levels.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\n==Campus==\nUiTM is Malaysia's largest institution of higher learning in terms of size and population. Besides the main campus in Shah Alam, the university has expanded nationwide with 34 branch campuses, which collectively offers more than 500 academic programmes. UiTM established a system called 1 University Multi System (1UiTM). Based on this system, there is an anchor university and 13 branch campuses.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=12 UiTM campuses to be given autonomy to administer |url=http://www.thesundaily.my/node/135788 |newspaper=The Sun Daily |location=Seri Iskandar |date=28 November 2010 |access-date=8 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe anchor university assumes the role of the administrative centre and the branch campuses will be the autonomous state administration.

Initially, it was known as RIDA Library that was loaded with reading materials for accounting book keeping and London Chamber of Commerce (LCC) examination preparatory courses. The administration of the library was operated in a room located on the first floor of the old Administrative Department building at RIDA Training Centre. Later, the library was moved to the ground floor of the Administrative Department annex to accommodate the increase of users and collections.\nIn 1965, the name of the library was changed to MARA College Library in conjunction with the change from RIDA Training Centre to MARA College. It was the first year that MARA College Library was administered by a certified officer in librarianship. The library collections at the time consisted only of books, journals, magazines, newspapers and other foreign publications in English.\nOn October 14, 1967, MARA College was again changed to MARA Institute of Technology (ITM). In a short period of time, the Jalan Othman campus could no longer accommodate the number of new professional courses that indirectly has caused an increase in the number of students. In 1972, the ITM main campus was built in Shah Alam. A four-storey building was specially designated as the ITM library, designed based on discussion with the Chief Librarian, according to specifications of an academic library. \n\nThis library was officiated by the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Tun Abdul Razak]] on July 29, 1972. The name Tun Abdul Razak Library was chosen in honour of the Prime Minister.\nOn August 26, 1999, the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] announced that ITM has been upgraded to [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] (UiTM). This new status brought UiTM Library to a transformational process from a traditional library to a hybrid library in line with the development of current technology. The library internal processes are now automated. In addition, UiTM Library services can now be accessed 24/7 via the website http://www.library.uitm.edu.my/. It functions as the primary source of online reference for users at all time, with the Anywhere, Anytime, Anyone concept.\n\n===Residential colleges===\nThere are 13 [[residential college]]s which provide accommodation to students in the main campus. These colleges differ from one another in terms of room capacity, where some colleges accommodate two students per room while some accommodate up to eight students per room. Residential colleges are not autonomous as they fall under the jurisdiction of UiTM. However, the director of each college has vast power endorsed to them in governing these colleges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hep1.uitm.edu.my/v1/pentadbiran/unit/99-unit-kemudahan-kolej.html |title=Unit Kemudahan Kolej |language=Malay |publisher=Bahagian Hal Ehwal Pelajar UiTM |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe colleges are [[Sex segregation#Contemporary policy examples|segregated by gender]] where different colleges cater only to either male or female students, with the exception of Kolej Teratai where male and female students live in different blocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hep1.uitm.edu.my/v1/kolej-teratai.html |title=Kolej Teratai |language=Malay |publisher=Bahagian Hal Ehwal Pelajar UiTM |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> Rental for residential colleges in Shah Alam campus is free for only first year students. However, a minimum fee is charged for second year students and above. First year students are not allowed to drive their own vehicles except for motorcycles. All colleges have access to free [[Wi-Fi]] service, which is part of the integrated wireless internet connection for the university itself.\n\nAs the main campus receives an increase in student enrolment each year, there are constraints on the residential college facilities. Many students in UiTM Shah Alam have to [[renting|rent]] off-campus residential facilities on their own. In ensuring the welfare and safety of the non-resident students who stay off-campus, the college management has established a Non-Resident Management Unit to manage living environment matters for these students. This unit will help non-resident students in search of accommodation within Shah Alam.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Muslim |display-authors=et al |last=Muhammad Hilmy |title=Challenges of Off-Campus Living Environment for Non-Resident Students' Well-Being in UiTM Shah Alam |conference=ASEAN Conference on Environment-Behaviour Studies |pages=873\u2013883 |date=16 July 2012 |location=Bangkok |url=|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.089 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThere are some facilities offered to non-resident students.

It is categorised into three main clusters namely business and management; social sciences and humanities; and science and technology. The Academic Affairs Division, headed by a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, is responsible to ensure the soundness of the academic programs as well as the robust, uniform and standardised academic delivery throughout the whole UiTM system across the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hea.uitm.edu.my/v1/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=198&Itemid=56 |title=Message from Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic and International) |publisher=Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) |access-date=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Senate is the highest authority in UiTM for all academic matters.

The idea was conceived as a result of a study visit to Ceylon in 1951 (now Sri Lanka) to look into its rural development programme. A resulting working paper outlined the establishment of [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat|Rural and Industrial Development Authority]] (RIDA) and its objectives of rebuilding the rural society, as well as improving the economy of rural Malays.<ref name=\"UiTM History\">{{cite web|url=https://www.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/about-uitm/others/historical-development|title=Historical Development|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=Universiti Teknologi MARA|access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref> A bill Paper No. 10/1951 was passed by the [[Federal Legislative Council]] on the same year that led to its establishment; reveals an interesting insight into the connection between RIDA Training Centre and the Malay community. Section 5 of this paper outlines the justification and the necessity of establishing Rural Industrial Development Authority (RIDA). The word ''kampong'' ({{lang-en|village}}), which is synonymous with the Malays, is also used in Section 8 of the paper.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ganti Shaari |first=Mohd Nazim |date= |title=Wither the Bumiputera Identity of UiTM? |url=http://web.usm.my/km/29(2)2011/Art4_KM29-2.pdf |journal=Journal of Malaysian Studies |publisher=Universiti Sains Malaysia |volume= 29 |issue=2 |pages=67\u201389 |doi= |access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Training Centre===\nIn November 1956, RIDA Training Centre began operations in [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Selangor]] (currently Jalan Othman satellite campus) under its first principal, Syed Alwi Syed Sheikh Alhadi. It was officially opened by Dr [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]], the Minister for Trade and Industry on 14 February 1957. The training centre conducted pre-university courses, business skills training and several external professional courses offered by established international bodies, such as the [[London Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Governance Institute of Australia|Australian Chartered Secretaryship]], the [[CPA Australia|Australian Society of Accountants]] and the [[British Institute of Management]]. After the formation of the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, the training centre began to admit native students from [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], and more academic programmes were offered. In 1964, RIDA Training Centre held its first convocation and 50 graduates were awarded certificates by [[Tun Abdul Razak]], the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\n[[File:Dewan Latehan Rida 1956.jpg|thumb|Dewan Latehan Rida 1956|The first batch of ''Dewan Latehan Rida'' students in Jalan Othman campus circa 1956.]]\nThe training centre later became known as MARA College ({{lang-ms|Maktab MARA}}) in 1965. The name change meant that the college no longer operated under RIDA and instead became the most important unit of the MARA Training Division. MARA stands for ''[[Majlis Amanah Rakyat]]'' ({{lang-en|Council of Trust for the Indigenous People}}) under the leadership of Tan Sri Arshad Ayub, took over and strengthened the role and responsibilities of RIDA. In 1966, when the British Institute of Management ceased conducting external examinations, MARA College began running its own Diploma in Business Studies. International recognition for the course came from [[University of West London|Ealing Technical College]] in London, which also became its external examiner.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n[[File:Logo Institut Teknologi MARA (ITM).png|160px|left|thumb|The logo of MARA Institute Of Technology ({{lang-ms|Institut Teknologi MARA, ITM}}) from 1967 until 1999.]]\n\n===Expansion and growth===\nIn 1967, the college was upgraded to [https://www.uitm.edu.my/index.php/en/about-uitm/others/historical-development?start=1 Institut Teknologi MARA]. Its establishment came as a response to a need in Malaysia for trained professionals, especially among ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputeras]]''. This shortage was identified through a manpower survey conducted by the government in 1965 collaboration with the [[United Nations]]. Acknowledging the fact that education holds the key to positive social engineering processes, ITM has made education easily accessible primarily to the ''bumiputera'' Malays and indigenous ''bumiputera'' of the Malay peninsula (such as [[Jakun people|Jakun]], [[Senoi]]), and those from the [[East Malaysia]] (such as the [[Kadazan-Dusun]], [[Melanau]], and [[Dayak people|Dayak]]).<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Muhammad |first=Ahmad Mazli |date=2007 |title=The Effectiveness of an Academic Reading Course in Facilitating Tertiary Students' Comprehension of Academic Texts |type=Ph.D |chapter=The History of UiTM |publisher=Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia |chapter-url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/359/11360667.pdf |access-date=8 February 2016}}</ref> It mainly catered to semi-professional courses predominantly in the science and technology in fields such as engineering, applied sciences and architecture, building and planning. However, realising the importance of other complementary nation-building fields, it has also included a repertoire of other salient 'management and humanities-based' fields such as business studies, hotel and catering management, mass communications, public administration, law, secretarial science, as well as art and design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmad |first=Abu Talib |date=15 December 2014 |title=Museums, History and Culture in Malaysia |edition=1st |publisher=[[NUS Press]] |isbn=978-9971698195}}</ref> By 1973, branch campuses had been set up in [[Perlis]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. The development of ITM was in three stages. The first phase (1967-1976) came with the declaration of the institute as an autonomous body with its own 300-acre campus in [[Shah Alam]], and was placed under the Ministry of Rural Development. The second phase (1976-1996) saw ITM rapidly harnessing its potential as an institution of higher learning. It led to the passing of the ITM Act of 1976 that placed the institute directly under the Ministry of Education.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\n===University status===\nThe third phase (1996-1999) came about as a result of an amendment to the ITM Act 1976 which granted the institution all the powers of a university and on par with all the universities in the country, despite retaining its name. Among the significant change was a creation of Board of Directors and Senate. Many principal officers of ITM were re-designated such as the Branch Director was renamed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]], the Head of Campus became the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], while Principal and Senior Lecturers were re-designated as [[Professors]] and Malay Associate Professors, respectively; each School was redesignated as a Faculty; ITM was given the power to confer degrees up to [[Doctor of Philosophy]] level; ITM was given the unique power to establish courses and campuses abroad with permission from the Minister of Education; the Institute was conferred additional powers to enable it to conduct business, invest in shares, set up companies and engage in commercial research; disciplinary powers over staff were transferred from the Minister to the Board of Directors; to improve staff accountability, the Institute was bestowed the power to impose a surcharge; and the procedural rights of students in disciplinary proceedings were strengthened.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\nIn August 1999, the [[Mahathir Mohamad|Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad]] announced the change in name of ITM to Universiti Teknologi MARA, UiTM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://me-kono.eu/institutions/universiti-teknologi-mara-uitm|title=Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)|publisher=Me'kono |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> With such acknowledgement from the government, a major restructuring exercise was carried out in order to consolidate the University's resources for optimum productivity. The ''Universiti Teknologi MARA'' Act 173 was drafted in conjunction with the establishment of UiTM. It is deemed essential as the Act provides guidelines for maintenance and smooth administration as well as other pertaining matters. The Act also serves as an acknowledgement of the institution\u2019s transition from an institute to a university, and the authority bestowed upon it to function like any other university. This includes the offering of courses of studies and the conferment of degrees at all levels.<ref name=\"UiTM History\" />\n\n==Campus==\nUiTM is Malaysia's largest institution of higher learning in terms of size and population. Besides the main campus in Shah Alam, the university has expanded nationwide with 34 branch campuses, which collectively offers more than 500 academic programmes. UiTM established a system called 1 University Multi System (1UiTM).

Initially, it was known as RIDA Library that was loaded with reading materials for accounting book keeping and London Chamber of Commerce (LCC) examination preparatory courses. The administration of the library was operated in a room located on the first floor of the old Administrative Department building at RIDA Training Centre. Later, the library was moved to the ground floor of the Administrative Department annex to accommodate the increase of users and collections.\nIn 1965, the name of the library was changed to MARA College Library in conjunction with the change from RIDA Training Centre to MARA College. It was the first year that MARA College Library was administered by a certified officer in librarianship. The library collections at the time consisted only of books, journals, magazines, newspapers and other foreign publications in English.\nOn October 14, 1967, MARA College was again changed to MARA Institute of Technology (ITM). In a short period of time, the Jalan Othman campus could no longer accommodate the number of new professional courses that indirectly has caused an increase in the number of students. In 1972, the ITM main campus was built in Shah Alam. A four-storey building was specially designated as the ITM library, designed based on discussion with the Chief Librarian, according to specifications of an academic library. \n\nThis library was officiated by the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Tun Abdul Razak]] on July 29, 1972. The name Tun Abdul Razak Library was chosen in honour of the Prime Minister.\nOn August 26, 1999, the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] announced that ITM has been upgraded to [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] (UiTM). This new status brought UiTM Library to a transformational process from a traditional library to a hybrid library in line with the development of current technology. The library internal processes are now automated. In addition, UiTM Library services can now be accessed 24/7 via the website http://www.library.uitm.edu.my/. It functions as the primary source of online reference for users at all time, with the Anywhere, Anytime, Anyone concept.\n\n===Residential colleges===\nThere are 13 [[residential college]]s which provide accommodation to students in the main campus. These colleges differ from one another in terms of room capacity, where some colleges accommodate two students per room while some accommodate up to eight students per room. Residential colleges are not autonomous as they fall under the jurisdiction of UiTM. However, the director of each college has vast power endorsed to them in governing these colleges.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hep1.uitm.edu.my/v1/pentadbiran/unit/99-unit-kemudahan-kolej.html |title=Unit Kemudahan Kolej |language=Malay |publisher=Bahagian Hal Ehwal Pelajar UiTM |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe colleges are [[Sex segregation#Contemporary policy examples|segregated by gender]] where different colleges cater only to either male or female students, with the exception of Kolej Teratai where male and female students live in different blocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hep1.uitm.edu.my/v1/kolej-teratai.html |title=Kolej Teratai |language=Malay |publisher=Bahagian Hal Ehwal Pelajar UiTM |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> Rental for residential colleges in Shah Alam campus is free for only first year students. However, a minimum fee is charged for second year students and above. First year students are not allowed to drive their own vehicles except for motorcycles. All colleges have access to free [[Wi-Fi]] service, which is part of the integrated wireless internet connection for the university itself.\n\nAs the main campus receives an increase in student enrolment each year, there are constraints on the residential college facilities. Many students in UiTM Shah Alam have to [[renting|rent]] off-campus residential facilities on their own. In ensuring the welfare and safety of the non-resident students who stay off-campus, the college management has established a Non-Resident Management Unit to manage living environment matters for these students. This unit will help non-resident students in search of accommodation within Shah Alam.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Muslim |display-authors=et al |last=Muhammad Hilmy |title=Challenges of Off-Campus Living Environment for Non-Resident Students' Well-Being in UiTM Shah Alam |conference=ASEAN Conference on Environment-Behaviour Studies |pages=873\u2013883 |date=16 July 2012 |location=Bangkok |url=|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.089 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThere are some facilities offered to non-resident students.

It is categorised into three main clusters namely business and management; social sciences and humanities; and science and technology.
