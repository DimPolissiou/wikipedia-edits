It was a major advance in the [[history of anatomy]] over the long-dominant work of [[Galen]], and presented itself as such.\n\nThe collection of books is based on his [[University of Padua|Paduan]] lectures, during which he deviated from common practice by dissecting a corpse to illustrate what he was discussing. [[Dissection]]s had previously been performed by a [[barber surgeon]] under the direction of a doctor of medicine, who was not expected to perform manual labour. Vesalius's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' presents a careful examination of the organs and the complete structure of the human body. This would not have been possible without the many advances that had been made during the [[Renaissance]], including artistic developments in literal visual representation and the technical development of printing with refined [[woodcut]] engravings. Because of these developments and his careful, immediate involvement, Vesalius was able to produce illustrations superior to any produced previously.\n\n==Books of the collection==\nVesalius arranged his work into seven books.\n\n===Book 1: The Bones and Cartilages===\nThe first book constitutes about a quarter of the entire collection. It presents Vesalius' observations on human bones and cartilage, which he [[body snatching|collected from cemeteries]]. It covers the physical appearance of human bones and the differentiation of human bones and cartilage by function. In each chapter Vesalius describes the bones in great detail, explaining their physical qualities in different ways. In the opening chapters,  Vesalius \"gives general aspects of bones and skeletal organisation, dealing with the differences in texture, strength,  and resilience between bone and cartilage; explaining the complex differences  between types of joints and reviewing some basic elements of descriptive techniques and terminology.\" A major theme of this book is whether [[Galen]] described the bones of the human skeleton accurately. When Vesalius lectured on the human skeleton, he also had to present the bones of animals to give credibility to Galen's observations.\n[[File:Vesalius Fabrica p163.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Image from [[Andreas Vesalius]]' ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543), page 163.]]\n\n===Book 2: The Ligaments and Muscles===\nHere Vesalius describes the structure of the muscles, the agents used in creating movement by the body, and the material used to hold the joints together. Through his observations of  butchers cutting meat, he was able to incorporate the skills they used in the dissection of the human body. The order in which to dissect a human body to effectively observe each muscle in the body is laid out. Each illustration displays a deepening view of the human body which can be followed while dissecting a human body.  Vesalius also mentions the instruments needed to perform a dissection. Here Vesalius begins to describe how Galen's anatomical descriptions do not match his own observations. In order to show respect to Galen, he suggests Galen's use of anatomical structure is in fact correct, but not for humans. He even continues to describe some of the structures in the way Galen would.\n\n===Book 3: The Veins and Arteries, Book 4: The Nerves===\nIn Books 3 and 4, Vesalius describes the veins, arteries, and nerves as vessels, but notes their differing physical structure: veins and  arteries contains a hollow channel, but nerves do not. Vesalius describes the route by which air travels through the lungs and the heart. He describes this process as \"a tree whose trunks divide into branches and twigs\". He also describes how the body contains four veins (the portal vein, the venae cavae, the artery-like vein [now understood as the [[Pulmonary Vein]]], and the umbilical vein) and two arteries (the aorta, and the vein-like artery [now understood as the [[Pulmonary Artery]]]) as being the main vessels which branch out into smaller veins and arteries. Vesalius lists some six hundred vessels in his tabulation of arteries, veins and nerves, but fails to mention the smaller vessels located in the hands and feet, the terminal vessels of the cutaneous nerves, or the vessels in the lungs and liver.\n\n===Book 5: The Organs of Nutrition and Generation===\nVesalius gives detailed descriptions of the organs of nutrition, the urinary system, and the male and female reproductive systems. The alimentary and reproductive systems each make up about forty percent of this book, and the description of the renal system and the correct technique for dissecting it makes up the remainder. In the final chapter, the longest chapter of the entire collection, Vesalius gives detailed step-by-step instructions on how to dissect the abdominopelvic organs. In the first half of the book, Vesalius describes the peritoneum, the esophagus, the stomach, the omentum, the intestines and the mesentery. He then goes on to describe the liver, gall bladder, and the spleen. Finally, he describes the kidneys, the bladder, and the ureters. Although Vesalius was unfamiliar with the anatomy of pregnancy, he provides illustrations of the placenta and the fetal membrane, making anatomical reference to Galen by comparing a dog's reproductive organs to those of a human.\n\n===Book 6: The Heart and Associated Organs, Book 7: The Brain===\n[[File:Vesalius 609c.png|thumb|upright|Vesalius' ''De humani corporis fabrica'', figure on plate 609, contrasted.]]\n\nThese books describe the structure and functions of the heart and the organs of respiration, the brain and its coverings, the eye, the organs of sensation, and the nerves of the limbs. A chapter is also devoted to the dissection of the eye. Vesalius describes the organs of the body in great detail by commenting \"on the variable strength of the attachment of the pleura to the thoracic walls, the strong attachment of the pericardium to the diaphragm, the shape and orientation of the ventricles of the heart,  and the description of the semilunar valves.\" He closes each book with a chapter on the correct way to dissect the heart and the brain respectively.\n\n==Galen's errors==\nGalen, the prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] [[physician]], [[surgeon]] and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] in the [[Roman empire]] had written on anatomy among other topics, but his work remained largely unchecked until the time of Vesalius. The ''Fabrica'' rectified some of Galen's worst errors, including the notion that the great blood vessels originated from the liver. While examining a human corpse, Vesalius discovered that Galen's observations were inconsistent with those of his, due to  Galen's use of animal (dog and monkey) cadavers. Even with his improvements, however, Vesalius clung to some of Galen's errors, such as the idea that a different type of blood flowed through veins than through arteries. It was not until [[William Harvey]]'s work on the [[circulation of the blood]] (''[[De Motu Cordis]]'', 1628) that this misconception of Galen's would be rectified in Europe.\n[[File:Vesalius Fabrica p372.jpg|thumb|upright|Image from ''De humani corporis fabrica'' (1543), page 372.]]\n\n==Publication==\n\n===1543 edition===\nVesalius had the work published at the age of 28, taking great pains to ensure its quality, and dedicated it to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The more than 250 illustrations are of great artistic merit and are generally attributed by modern scholars to the \"studio of [[Titian]]\" rather than [[Jan Van Calcar|Johannes Stephanus of Calcar]], who provided drawings for Vesalius' earlier tracts. The woodcuts were greatly superior to the illustrations in anatomical atlases of the day, which were never made by anatomy professors themselves.  The woodcut blocks were transported to [[Basel|Basel, Switzerland]], as Vesalius wished that the work be published by one of the foremost printers of the time, [[Johannes Oporinus]]. Vesalius' written directions to Oporinus (the ''iter'') were so valuable the printer decided to include them. The illustrations were engraved on wooden blocks, which allowed for very fine detail.<ref>Brian S. Baigrie ''Scientific Revolutions'', pages 40\u201349 has more information and a translation of Vesalius' preface.</ref>\n\n===1555 edition===\n\nA second edition was published in 1555. Annotations in a copy of that edition donated to the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]], [[University of Toronto]], have been identified as Vesalius's own, showing that he was contemplating a third edition, never achieved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.utoronto.ca/u-t-acquires-annotated-copy-vesaliuss-great-anatomical-book |title=U of T acquires annotated copy of Vesalius's great anatomical book |publisher=University of Toronto |date=2013-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe success of ''Fabrica'' recouped the work's considerable expense, and brought Vesalius European fame, partly through cheap unauthorized copies. He was appointed physician to the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]]; Vesalius presented him with the first published copy (bound in silk of imperial purple, with specially hand-painted illustrations not found in any other copy). To accompany the ''Fabrica'', Vesalius published a condensed and less expensive ''Epitome'': at the time of publication in 1543, it cost 10 [[batzen]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kusukawa |first1=Sachiko |title=De humani corporis fabrica.

This modern and novel rifle will allow all our Military Forces, Police and State Security Organizations to improve effectiveness in the fight against the actors that generate violence that affect the security of the country.\n\nThe * Galil C\u00f3rdoba * is another rifle that is based on the Colombian Galil AR '''https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evqi-Xq-gw8''' I remind you that Colombia is the only country or nation in the whole world that manufactures the Galil in all its variants AR, SAR, ARM, ACE, AND C\u00d3RDOBA.\n\nIWI together with FAMAE jointly produce some parts of the ACE rifle, the rest is imported from Colombia, (Ministry of National Defense) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngWSx9zE-HM Bone, * IWI and FAMAE * they are only assemblers of the Colombian ACE rifle\n\n\n==Design details==\n===Weight reduction===\n\nThe original [[IMI Galil|Galil]] was built with a machined solid steel billet action in order to increase the structural integrity and survivability of the weapon. Unfortunately this resulted in a weight of up to {{cvt|9.6|lb|kg}}, depending on its variant, which was one of the primary criticisms from the [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\nThe ACE has a significantly reduced weight. IWI redesigned the action to integrate the steel with polymer, which is much lighter than the fully steel receiver of the original Galil.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\"/> While the upper receiver is machined steel and the receiver top features a MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]], polymer has been introduced to the lower receiver of the weapon to reduce the gun's weight.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927&page=2|title=Galil Ace 5.56|date=29 May 2013|website=Small Arms Defense Journal|version=Volume 5|page=2|first=Paolo|last=Ortenzi}}</ref>\n\n===Accuracy===\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'': \u201cAlthough this rifle is clearly based on the AK design, it demonstrated a superior level of accuracy potential compared to several of its cousins. The best single group of [5 rounds at 100 yards] of 0.83\u2033 and five-group average of 0.98\u2033 was produced using the Federal Premium 123-[[Grain (unit)|gr.]] [{{cvt|123|gr|g|disp=out|lk=on}}] Power-Shok soft-point load\u201d (testing done using 7.62\u00d739mm 16-inch barrelled variant).<ref name=\"AmericanRifleman\" />\n\n===Gas tube===\nThe gas tube, unlike the AK-47 system, is mounted on the rifle via a dovetailed slide machined on the receiver upper-front block. This avoids any movement of the gas block influencing barrel vibration, which would degrade accuracy.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\" />\n\n===Long-stroke piston system===\nThe rifle uses the Galil's [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long-stroke piston]] system. The long-stroke system is found in the [[M1 Garand]], [[AK-47]] (upon which the Galil's internal mechanism design borrowed heavily) and more recently in the [[IWI Tavor]].\n\n===Barrel===\nThe barrel is chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged, with a 1:7\u2033 twist for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], 1:9.5\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d739mm]] and 1:12\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n\n===Trigger===\nThe ACE adopts the [[IMI Galil#Galatz|Galil Sniper]] trigger instead of the original Galil trigger, in order to improve accuracy compared to the standard Galil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/08/24/galil-ace-rifle|title=Galil Ace Rifle|date=24 August 2010|first=Steve|last=Johnson|website=The Firearm Blog}}</ref> This is a two-stage trigger,<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\" /> which IWI have modelled on the two-stage trigger of the [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"Kokalis\">{{cite book|first=Peter G.|last=Kokalis|title=Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of ''Soldier of Fortune''|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Paladin Press|date=2001|page=253|isbn=978-1581601220}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'', the two-stage trigger is \u201cclean and smooth with a 4 lb. 13 oz.

The bolt hold-open feature is a common request of military customers, to reduce reloading times during combat.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II|last=Tilstra|first=Russell C.|date=21 March 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786473212|pages=98}}</ref>\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe ACE has a fully adjustable [[iron sights]] with tritium front post and two dot tritium rear aperture. It also features a [[Picatinny rail]] for mounting various optical sight.\n\n===Stock===\nThe standard buttstock found on the ACE is a six-position telescopic stock that can be fitted with an optional cheek-piece to improve the sighting of the weapon when using an [[Sight (device)#Optical sights|optical sight]]. An optional right folding version of the standard buttstock is also available.<ref name=\"indumil.gov.co\"/>\n\nThe forearm consists of MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]]s on the bottom and both sides for mounting accessories such as aiming optics. The side forearm rails have central grooves to provide routing channels for electric wiring used by pressure switch activated accessories. The forearm comes with quick detachable polymer covering panels that can be mounted to protect the rails when a side or bottom rail has no accessories mounted to it.  The gas tube above the barrel also has a Picatinny rail mounted on top that is aligned with the rail mounted on the cover over the receiver.\n\n==Variants==\nThe ACE is available in three different calibres with multiple barrel lengths for each type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwi.net/ace/|title=ACE|website=Israel Weapon Industries}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model\n!Calibre\n!Barrel length\n!Length (extended)\n!Length (retracted)\n!Weight (unloaded)\n!Feed system\n!Muzzle velocity\n!Range\n!Rate of Fire<br>(rounds per minute)\n|-\n|ACE 21\n|[[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.00|kg|lb}}\n|35-round [[IMI Galil#Feeding|Galil magazine]]\n|{{cvt|710|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|300|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE-N 21\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.05|kg|lb}}\n|30-round [[STANAG magazine|NATO magazine]]\n|{{cvt|710|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|300|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 22\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|335|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|767|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.40|kg|lb}}\n|35-round Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|850|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE-N 22\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|335|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|767|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.45|kg|lb}}\n|30-round NATO magazine\n|{{cvt|850|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 23\n|5.56\u00d745mm NATO\n|{{cvt|463|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|976|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|896|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.60|kg|lb}}\n|35-round Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|915|m/s|ft/s}}\n|{{cvt|500|m|yd}}\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 31\n|[[7.62\u00d739mm]]\n|{{cvt|216|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|730|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|650|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.00|kg|lb}}\n|30-round [[AK-47#Magazines|AK magazine]]\n|{{cvt|600|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680-880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 32\n|7.62\u00d739mm\n|{{cvt|409|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|927|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|847|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.50|kg|lb}}\n|30-round AK magazine\n|{{cvt|680|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|680\u2013880 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 52\n|[[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]\n|{{cvt|409|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|954|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|874|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.60|kg|lb}}\n|25-round [[IMI Galil#7.62mm variants|7.62mm Galil]] magazine\n|{{cvt|800|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 52L\n|7.62\u00d751mm NATO\n|{{cvt|457|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|992|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|912|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.71|kg|lb}}\n|25-round 7.62mm Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|830|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|-\n|ACE 53\n|7.62\u00d751mm NATO\n|{{cvt|511|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|1055|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|963|mm|in}}\n|{{cvt|3.8|kg|lb}}\n|25-round 7.62mm Galil magazine\n|{{cvt|860|m/s|ft/s}}\n|\u2014\n|620\u2013680 RPM\n|}\n\nAt some point,{{When|date=March 2017}} the ACE 52L was removed from the production line.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:ACE32.JPG|A right-side view of the ACE 21 (5.56\u00d745mm NATO), with a cheek weld on its buttstock.\nFile:Ace 32 close stock.jpg|A left-side view of the ACE 32 (7.62\u00d739mm).\nFile:Ace 52 side 2.jpg|A right-side view of the ACE 52 (7.62\u00d751mm NATO)\n</gallery>\n\n==Users==\n[[File:VII Cumbre Alianza del Pac\u00edfico (8754541903).jpg|thumb|The Colombian Police armed with the ACE 22.]]\n[[File:Galil ACE 32.jpg|thumb|The ACE 32 used in the Vietnam People's Army.]]\n\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

produced in three different calibers; [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], [[7.62\u00d739mm]] and [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n\nThe ACE family is based upon the mechanism of the [[IMI Galil]], but using a modernized design and materials to increase its accuracy and lower its weight, while maintaining the Galil's ergonomics, ease of maintenance and reliability under battle conditions.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927|title=Galil Ace 5.56|date=29 May 2013|website=Small Arms Defense Journal|page=1|version=Volume 5|first=Paolo|last=Ortenzi}}</ref> Emphasis was placed in particular in increasing its reliability and accuracy under adverse or battlefield conditions.\n\nIt is the main standard-issue assault rifle of the [[Chilean Army]], of the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and of the [[Military of Colombia|Colombian Army, Navy, Air Force]] and [[National Police of Colombia|Colombian Police]].\n\n==Design details==\n===Weight reduction===\n\nThe original [[IMI Galil|Galil]] was built with a machined solid steel billet action in order to increase the structural integrity and survivability of the weapon. Unfortunately this resulted in a weight of up to {{cvt|9.6|lb|kg}}, depending on its variant, which was one of the primary criticisms from the [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\nThe ACE has a significantly reduced weight. IWI redesigned the action to integrate the steel with polymer, which is much lighter than the fully steel receiver of the original Galil.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\"/> While the upper receiver is machined steel and the receiver top features a MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]], polymer has been introduced to the lower receiver of the weapon to reduce the gun's weight.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1927&page=2|title=Galil Ace 5.56|date=29 May 2013|website=Small Arms Defense Journal|version=Volume 5|page=2|first=Paolo|last=Ortenzi}}</ref>\n\n===Accuracy===\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'': \u201cAlthough this rifle is clearly based on the AK design, it demonstrated a superior level of accuracy potential compared to several of its cousins. The best single group of [5 rounds at 100 yards] of 0.83\u2033 and five-group average of 0.98\u2033 was produced using the Federal Premium 123-[[Grain (unit)|gr.]] [{{cvt|123|gr|g|disp=out|lk=on}}] Power-Shok soft-point load\u201d (testing done using 7.62\u00d739mm 16-inch barrelled variant).<ref name=\"AmericanRifleman\" />\n\n===Gas tube===\nThe gas tube, unlike the AK-47 system, is mounted on the rifle via a dovetailed slide machined on the receiver upper-front block. This avoids any movement of the gas block influencing barrel vibration, which would degrade accuracy.<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P1\" />\n\n===Long-stroke piston system===\nThe rifle uses the Galil's [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long-stroke piston]] system. The long-stroke system is found in the [[M1 Garand]], [[AK-47]] (upon which the Galil's internal mechanism design borrowed heavily) and more recently in the [[IWI Tavor]].\n\n===Barrel===\nThe barrel is chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged, with a 1:7\u2033 twist for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]], 1:9.5\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d739mm]] and 1:12\u2033 for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n\n===Trigger===\nThe ACE adopts the [[IMI Galil#Galatz|Galil Sniper]] trigger instead of the original Galil trigger, in order to improve accuracy compared to the standard Galil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2010/08/24/galil-ace-rifle|title=Galil Ace Rifle|date=24 August 2010|first=Steve|last=Johnson|website=The Firearm Blog}}</ref> This is a two-stage trigger,<ref name=\"SADJ Galil ACE P2\" /> which IWI have modelled on the two-stage trigger of the [[M1 Garand]].<ref name=\"Kokalis\">{{cite book|first=Peter G.|last=Kokalis|title=Weapons Tests and Evaluations: The Best of ''Soldier of Fortune''|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Paladin Press|date=2001|page=253|isbn=978-1581601220}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[American Rifleman]]'', the two-stage trigger is \u201cclean and smooth with a 4 lb. 13 oz.

Gil|last=Horman|date=19 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Last round bolt catch===\nAnother addition by IWI to the original Galil is the last round bolt catch (for variants of the ACE in 5.56\u00d745mm NATO only). The bolt hold-open feature is a common request of military customers, to reduce reloading times during combat.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II|last=Tilstra|first=Russell C.|date=21 March 2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0786473212|pages=98}}</ref>\n\n=== Sights ===\nThe ACE has a fully adjustable [[iron sights]] with tritium front post and two dot tritium rear aperture. It also features a [[Picatinny rail]] for mounting various optical sight.\n\n===Stock===\nThe standard buttstock found on the ACE is a six-position telescopic stock that can be fitted with an optional cheek-piece to improve the sighting of the weapon when using an [[Sight (device)#Optical sights|optical sight]]. An optional right folding version of the standard buttstock is also available.<ref name=\"indumil.gov.co\"/>\n\nThe forearm consists of MIL-STD-1913 [[Picatinny rail]]s on the bottom and both sides for mounting accessories such as aiming optics.

This has been verified by a high-quality reliable source-->), known professionally as '''Kartik Aaryan''', is an Indian actor who appears in [[Bollywood|Hindi films]]. While pursuing an engineering degree in biotechnology, he dabbled in modelling and made attempts to start a career in film. After struggling for three years, Aaryan made his acting debut in 2011 with ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama]]'', a [[buddy film]] about the romantic tribulations faced by three young men, which was directed by [[Luv Ranjan]] and co-starred [[Nushrat Bharucha]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloggerwlogger.com/.ShubhamSrivastava/Everything-that-you-should-know-if-you-are-a-Kartik-Aaryan-Fan-pfu77lyq1k4o/|title=Everything that you should know if you are a Kartik Aaryan Fan|website=bloggerwlogger.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAaryan went on to play the romantic interest of the lead female characters in ''[[Akaash Vani]]'' (2013) and ''[[Kaanchi: The Unbreakable]]'' (2014), but these films failed to propel his career forward. He subsequently collaborated with Ranjan and Bharucha in two more buddy films, ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2]]'' (2015) and ''[[Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety]]'' (2018), both of which were commercially successful but received criticism for their misogynistic themes. The latter proved to be a breakthrough for Aaryan, and he followed it by starring in the 2019 romantic comedies ''[[Luka Chuppi]]'' and ''[[Pati Patni Aur Woh (2019 film)|Pati Patni Aur Woh]]''.\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Aaryan endorses several brands and products, and has co-hosted two award ceremonies.

This has been verified by a high-quality reliable source-->), known professionally as '''Kartik Aaryan''', is an Indian actor who appears in [[Bollywood|Hindi films]]. While pursuing an engineering degree in biotechnology, he dabbled in modelling and made attempts to start a career in film. After struggling for three years, Aaryan made his acting debut in 2011 with ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama]]'', a [[buddy film]] about the romantic tribulations faced by three young men, which was directed by [[Luv Ranjan]] and co-starred [[Nushrat Bharucha]].\n\nAaryan went on to play the romantic interest of the lead female characters in ''[[Akaash Vani]]'' (2013) and ''[[Kaanchi: The Unbreakable]]'' (2014), but these films failed to propel his career forward. He subsequently collaborated with Ranjan and Bharucha in two more buddy films, ''[[Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2]]'' (2015) and ''[[Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety]]'' (2018), both of which were commercially successful but received criticism for their misogynistic themes. The latter proved to be a breakthrough for Aaryan, and he followed it by starring in the 2019 romantic comedies ''[[Luka Chuppi]]'' and ''[[Pati Patni Aur Woh (2019 film)|Pati Patni Aur Woh]]''.\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Aaryan endorses several brands and products, and has co-hosted two award ceremonies. He appeared in ''[[Forbes India]]''{{'s}} [[Forbes Celebrity 100|Celebrity 100]] list of 2019.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n=== Early life and work (1990\u20132017) ===\n\nKartik Tiwari (later Aaryan){{efn|name=A}} was born on 22 November 1990<!-- DO NOT CHANGE!

From the early 7th century BC and onwards, the Iranian [[Medes]] followed by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and other subsequent Iranian states and empires dominated the region. In the 1st century BC, the expanding [[Roman Republic]] absorbed the whole [[Eastern Mediterranean]], which included much of the [[Near East]]. The Eastern Roman Empire, today commonly known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], ruling from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Euphrates]], became increasingly defined by and dogmatic about [[Christianity]], gradually creating religious rifts between the doctrines dictated by the establishment in [[Constantinople]] and believers in many parts of the Middle East. From the 3rd century up to the course of the 7th century&nbsp;AD, the entire Middle East was dominated by the Byzantines and the [[Sasanian Empire]]. From the 7th century, a new power was rising in the Middle East, that of [[Islam]]. The dominance of the [[Arabs]] came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq dynasty]]. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], mainly [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], swept through the region. By the early 15th century, a new power had arisen in western Anatolia, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emirs, linguistically Turkic and religiously Islamic, who in [[Fall of Constantinople|1453 captured the Christian Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] and made themselves [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|sultans]].\n\nLarge parts of the Middle East became a warground between the Ottomans and the Iranian [[Safavid dynasty]] for centuries, starting in the early 16th century. By 1700, the Ottomans had been driven out of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] along the frontier had shifted decisively in favor of the [[Western world]]. The [[British Empire]] also established effective control of the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[French colonial empire]] extended its influence into [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]]. In 1912, the [[Kingdom of Italy]] seized [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese|Dodecanese islands]], just off the coast of the Ottoman heartland of [[Anatolia]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Middle Eastern rulers tried to modernize their states to compete more effectively with the European powers. A turning point in the '''history of the Middle East''' came when [[petroleum|oil]] was discovered, first in Persia in 1908 and later in [[Saudi Arabia]] (in 1938) and the other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]], and also in [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]]. A Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil and the decline of British influence led to a growing American interest in the region.\n\nDuring the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Syria and Egypt made moves towards independence. The British, the French, and the [[Soviet Union]] departed from many parts of the Middle East during and after [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945). The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] culminated in the 1947 [[United Nations]] [[1947 UN Partition Plan|plan to partition Palestine]]. Later in the midst of [[Cold War]] tensions, the Arabic-speaking countries of [[Western Asia]] and [[Northern Africa]] saw the rise of [[pan-Arabism]]. The departure of the European powers from direct control of the region, the establishment of [[Israel]], and the increasing importance of the [[petroleum industry]], marked the creation of the modern Middle East. In most Middle Eastern countries, the growth of market economies was inhibited by political restrictions, corruption and [[cronyism]], overspending on arms and prestige projects, and over-dependence on oil revenues. The wealthiest economies in the region [[per capita]] are the small oil-rich countries of [[Persian Gulf]]: [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].\n\nA combination of factors\u2014among them the 1967 [[Six-Day War]],<ref name=\"wright\">Robin Wright, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam'', pp. 65\u201366</ref> the [[1970s energy crisis]] beginning with the 1973 [[OPEC]] oil embargo in response to U.S. support of Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]],<ref name=\"wright\"/><ref>interview by Robin Wright of UK Foreign Secretary (at the time) Lord Carrington in November 1981, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam'' by Robin Wright, Simon and Schuster, (1985), p. 67</ref> the concurrent Saudi-led popularization of [[Salafism]]/[[Wahhabism]],<ref name=Kepel-petro>{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|year=2003|publisher=I.B.

The [[Fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 brought a global security refocus from the [[Cold War]] to a [[War on Terror]]. Starting in the early 2010s, a [[revolutionary wave]] popularly known as the [[Arab Spring]] brought major protests, uprisings, and revolutions to several Middle Eastern and [[Maghreb]] countries. [[Anbar campaign (2013\u201314)|Clashes in western Iraq]] on 30 December 2013 were preliminary to the Sunni [[pan-Islamist]] [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] uprising.\n\nThe term ''Near East'' can be used interchangeably with ''Middle East'', but in a different context, especially when discussing [[ancient history]], it may have a limited meaning, namely the northern, historically [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking [[Semitic people]] area and adjacent [[Anatolia]]n territories, marked in the two maps below.\n\n[[File:NearEast3.png|right|thumb|{{legend|#008000|The limited modern archaeological and historical context of the Near East}}{{legend|#00ff00|Middle East and Near East}}]]\n[[File:Semitic languages.svg|right|thumb|The historical [[Semitic people|Semitic region]], defined by the pre-Islamic distribution of [[Semitic language]]s and coinciding very roughly with the [[Arabian plate]]. Not so much lingually but rather culturally, politically and historically, the most significant division here has been between the north and the south, to some degree isolated from each other by the sparsely populated [[Arabian Desert]]. The north comprises [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Levant]], which, together with the lower [[Nile]] (i.e., Egypt), constitute the [[Fertile Crescent]].]]\n\n==General==\nGeographically, the Middle East can be thought of as [[Western Asia]] with the addition of [[Egypt]] (which is the non-[[Maghreb]] region of [[Northern Africa]]) and with the exclusion of the [[Caucasus]]. The Middle East was the first to experience a [[Neolithic Revolution]] (c. the 10th millennium BC), as well as the first to enter the [[Bronze Age]] (c. 3300\u20131200 BC) and [[Iron Age]] (c. 1200\u2013500 BC).\n\nHistorically human populations have tended to settle around bodies of water, which is reflected in modern population density patterns. [[Irrigation]] systems were extremely important for the agricultural Middle East: for Egypt that of the lower [[Nile River]], and for Mesopotamia that of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. Levantine agriculture depended on [[precipitation]] rather than on the river-based irrigation of Egypt and Mesopotamia, resulting in preference for different crops. Since travel was faster and easier by sea, civilizations along the [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Phoenicia]] and later Greece, participated in intense trade. Similarly, [[History of Yemen#Ancient history|Ancient Yemen]], much more conducive to agriculture than the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, sea traded heavily with the [[Horn of Africa]], some of which it lingually Semitized. The [[Adnanite]] Arabs, inhabiting the drier desert areas of the Middle East, were all [[nomadic]] [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] before some began settling in [[city state]]s, with the geo-linguistic distribution today being divided between [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Najd]] and the [[Hejaz]] in the Peninsula, as well as the [[Bedouin]] areas beyond the Peninsula.\n\nSince ancient times the Middle East has had several [[lingua franca]]: [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ({{circa}} 14th\u20138th century BC), [[Aramaic]] ({{circa}} 8th century BC&nbsp;\u2013 8th century AD),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader|first1=Suzanne|last1=Richard|edition=Illustrated|publisher=EISENBRAUNS|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57506-083-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=khR0apPid8gC&pg=PA69 |page=69}}</ref> [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{circa}} 4th century BC&nbsp;\u2013 8th century AD), and [[Arabic]] ({{circa}} 8th century AD&nbsp;\u2013 present).

Initially the ancient inhabitants of the region followed various [[ethnic religion]]s, but most of those began to be gradually replaced at first by Christianity (even before the 313 AD [[Edict of Milan]]) and finally by Islam (after the spread of the [[Muslim conquests]] beyond the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in 634 AD). To this day, however, the Middle East has, in particular, some [[Christianity in the Middle East|sizable, ethnically distinct Christian minority groups]], as well as Jews, concentrated in Israel, and followers of Iranian religions, such as [[Yazd\u00e2nism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. Some of the smaller [[ethnoreligious]] minorities include the [[Shabak people]], the [[Mandaeans]] and the [[Samaritans]]. It is somewhat controversial whether the [[Druze]] religion is a distinct religion in its own right or merely a part of the [[Ismailism|Ismailist]] branch of [[Shia Islam]].\n\n==Prehistoric Near East==\n{{See also|Prehistoric Egypt||Prehistory of Iran|Prehistory of the Southern Levant|Prehistoric Cyprus|Natufian culture|History of agriculture|Timeline of Middle Eastern history|Timeline of human prehistory}}\n[[File:Fertile crescent Neolithic B circa 7500 BC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Area of the [[fertile crescent]], circa 7500 BC, with main sites of the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] period.

However, its empires also introduced rigid [[social stratification]], [[slavery]], and organized [[warfare]].\n\n===Cradle of civilization, Sumer and Akkad===\nThe earliest [[civilization]]s in history were established in the region now known as the Middle East around 3500 BC by the [[Sumer]]ians, in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]), widely regarded as the [[cradle of civilization]]. The [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], and later [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] all flourished in this region.\n\n\"In the course of the fourth millennium BC, city-states developed in southern Mesopotamia that were dominated by temples whose priests represented the cities' patron deities. The most prominent of the city-states was Sumer, which gave its language to the area, [presumably the [[History of writing|first written language]],] and became the first great civilization of mankind. About 2340 BC, [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon the Great]] (c. 2360\u20132305 BC) united the city-states in the south and founded the Akkadian dynasty, the world's first empire.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6308/1/Ancient-Civilizations--Mesopotamia.html|title=Ancient Civilizations&nbsp;\u2013 Mesopotamia|first=Albert S.|last=Lyons|publisher=Health Guidance.org|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring this same time period, Sargon the Great appointed his daughter, [[Enheduanna]], as High Priestess of Inanna at Ur.<ref>http://www.ancient.eu/akkad/</ref> Her writings, which established her as the first known author in world history, also helped cement Sargon's position in the region.\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Ancient Egypt}}\nSoon after the Sumerian civilization began, the [[Nile valley]] of [[Lower Egypt|Lower]] and [[Upper Egypt]] was unified under the [[Pharaoh]]s approximately around 3150 BC. Since then, Ancient Egypt experienced 3 high points of civilization, the so-called \"Kingdom\" periods:\n* The [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] (2686\u20132181),\n* The [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2055\u20131650) and, most notably,\n* The [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1550\u20131069).\nThe history of Ancient Egypt is concluded by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (664\u2013332 BC), immediately followed by the history of Egypt in [[Classical Antiquity]], beginning with [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\n===The Levant and Anatolia===\n{{Main|History of the ancient Levant|History of Anatolia}}\nThereafter, civilization quickly spread through the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and throughout the [[Levant]], as well as to [[History of Anatolia|ancient Anatolia]]. Ancient Levantine kingdoms and city states included [[Ebla]] City, [[Ugarit]] City, [[Aram-Damascus|Kingdom of Aram-Damascus]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah]], [[Kingdom of Ammon]], [[Kingdom of Moab]], [[Kingdom of Edom]], and the [[Nabatean kingdom]]. The [[Phoenicia]]n civilization, encompassing several city states, was a [[Thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that established [[Colony|colonial]] cities in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], most notably [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage, in 814 BC]].\n\n===Assyrian empires===\n{{Main|Assyria}}\n[[Mesopotamia]] was home to several powerful empires that came to rule almost the entire Middle East\u2014particularly the [[Assyrian Empire]]s of 1365\u20131076 BC and the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] of 911\u2013605 BC. The Assyrian Empire, at its peak, was the largest the world had seen. It ruled all of what is now Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, and Bahrain\u2014with large swathes of Iran, Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Sudan, and Arabia.\n\"The Assyrian empires, particularly the third, had a profound and lasting impact on the Near East. Before Assyrian hegemony ended, the Assyrians brought the highest civilization to the then known world. From the Caspian to Cyprus, from Anatolia to Egypt, Assyrian imperial expansion would bring into the Assyrian sphere nomadic and barbaric communities, and would bestow the gift of civilization upon them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/brief.html |title=Brief History of Assyrians |first=Peter |last=BetBasoo |year=2007 |publisher=Assyrian International News Agency |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KKWk56jd?url=http://www.aina.org/brief.html |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian and Persian empires===\n{{Main|Babylonia|Persian Empire}}\nFrom the early 6th century BC onwards, several Persian states dominated the region, beginning with the [[Medes]] and non-Persian [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], then their successor the [[Achaemenid Empire]] known as the first Persian Empire, conquered in the late 4th century BC by the very short-lived [[Macedonian Empire]] of [[Alexander the Great]], and then successor kingdoms such as [[History of Egypt|Ptolemaic Egypt]] and the [[Seleucid]] state in Western Asia.\n\nAfter a century of hiatus, the idea of the Persian Empire was revived by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] in the 3rd century BC\u2014and continued by their successors, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] from the 3rd century AD. This empire dominated sizable parts of what is now the Asian part of the Middle East and continued to influence the rest of the Asiatic and African Middle East region, until the Arab [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th&nbsp;century AD. Between the 1st century BC and the early 7th century AD, the region was completely dominated by the Romans and the Parthians and Sassanids on the other hand, which often culminated in various [[Roman-Persian Wars]] over the seven centuries. Eastern Rite, [[Church of the East]] Christianity took hold in [[Asorestan|Persian-ruled Mesopotamia]], particularly in [[Assyria]] from the 1st century AD onwards, and the region became a center of a flourishing [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]]\u2013[[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] literary tradition.\n\n===Greek and Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Macedonian Empire|Roman Empire}}\n[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|right|240px|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent, under [[Trajan]], 117 AD]]\nIn 66\u201363 BC, the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Pompey]] conquered much of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Brief History of the Middle East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krKeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false|first = Christopher|last = Catherwood |publisher = Little, Brown Book Group|date = 2011|isbn = 9781849018074}}</ref> The [[Roman Empire]] united the region with most of Europe and North Africa in a single political and economic unit.

By the 5th century, Christianity was the dominant religion in the Middle East, with other faiths (gradually including ''[[heresy|heretical]]'' Christian sects) being actively repressed. The Middle East's ties to the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] were gradually severed as the Empire [[Roman Empire#Partition of the Empire|split]] into [[Byzantine Empire|East]] and [[Western Roman Empire|West]], with the Middle East tied to the new Roman capital of [[Constantinople]]. The subsequent [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] therefore, had minimal direct impact on the region.\n\n====Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire)====\n{{Main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman Empire, today commonly known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], ruling from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Euphrates]], became increasingly defined by and dogmatic about Christianity, gradually creating religious rifts between the doctrines dictated by the establishment in Constantinople and believers in many parts of the Middle East. By this time, Greek had become the 'lingua franca' of the region, although ethnicities such as the Syriacs and the Hebrew continued to exist. Under Byzantine/Greek rule the area of the [[Levant]] met an era of stability and prosperity.\n\n==Post-classical Middle East{{anchor|Medieval Near East|Post-classical Middle East}}==\n{{see|Post-classical history}}\n\n===Pre-Islam===\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The Byzantine-Sasanian rivalry was also seen through their respective cultures and religions. The Byzantines considered themselves champions of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] and Christianity. Meanwhile, the Sasanians thought themselves heroes of ancient Iranian traditions and of the traditional Persian religion, [[Zoroastrianism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Esposito|1999|pages=1\u20135}}, for the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian rivalry and its cultural/religious overtones.</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman-Persian_Frontier,_5th_century.png|thumb|Map of the Roman\u2013Persian frontier after the division of Armenia in 384. The frontier remained stable throughout the 5th century.]]\n\nThe Arabian peninsula already played a role in the power struggles of the Byzantines and Sasanians. While Byzantium allied itself with the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] in the horn of Africa, the Sasanian Empire assisted the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in what is now [[Yemen]] (southwest Arabia). Thus the clash between the kingdoms of Aksum and Himyar in 525 displayed a higher power struggle between Byzantium and Persia for control of the [[Red Sea]] trade. Territorial wars soon became common, with the Byzantines and Sasanians fighting over upper [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Armenia]] and key cities that facilitated trade from Arabia, India, and China.<ref>{{harvnb|Esposito|1999|pages=1\u20135}}, for the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian struggle with Aksum and Himyar, as well as the territorial wars and focus on trade.</ref> Byzantium, as the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire, continued control of the latter's territories in the Middle East. Since 527, this included Anatolia, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Egypt]]. But in 603 the Sasanians invaded, conquering Damascus and Egypt. It was Emperor [[Heraclius]] who was able to repel these invasions, and in 628 he replaced the Sasanian Great King with a more docile one. But the fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power.{{sfn|Wawro|2008|pages=112\u2013115|ps=, for Byzantine territory, Sasanian invasions, Heraclius' success at repelling invasion, and the exhaustion of both states.}}<ref>{{harvnb|Esposito|1999|pages=1\u20135}}, for the replacement of the Sasanian king by Heraclius.</ref>\n\nThe nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes dominated the Arabian desert, where they worshiped [[Idolatry|idols]] and remained in small clans tied together by kinship. Urbanization and agriculture was limited in Arabia, save for a few regions near the coast. [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] (then called Yathrib) were two such cities that were important hubs for trade between Africa and Eurasia. This commerce was central to city-life, where most inhabitants were merchants.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=138}} Nevertheless, some Arabs saw it fit to migrate to the northern regions of the [[Fertile Crescent]], a Persian region so named for its place between the [[Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates rivers]] that offered it fertile land. This included entire tribal chiefdoms such as the [[Lakhmids]] in a less controlled area of the Sasanian Empire, and the [[Ghassanids]] in a similar area inside of Byzantine territory; these political units of Arab origin offered a surprising stability that was rare in the region and offered Arabia further connections to the outside world. The Lakhmid capital, [[Al-Hirah|Hira]] was a center for Christianity and Jewish craftsmen, merchants, and farmers were common in western Arabia as were Christian monks in central Arabia. Thus pre-Islamic Arabia was no stranger to Abrahamic religions or monotheism, for that matter.{{sfn|Hourani|2013|loc=The world into which the Arabs came|ps=, for Arabian migrations, the Lakhmids & Ghassanids, and religious diversity.}}\n\n===Islamic caliphate===\n{{See also|Caliphate|Muslim conquests|Iranian Intermezzo}}\n\n[[Image:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|350px|Age of the [[Caliph]]s {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], 632\u2013661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]], 661\u2013750}}]]\nWhile the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628|warfare (602\u2013628)]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], [[Rashidun army|Arab armies]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Byzantine territory]] and completely [[Muslim conquest of Persia|engulfing the Persian lands]]. In [[Anatolia]], they were stopped in the [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)]] by the Byzantines, who were helped by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]].\n\nThe Byzantine provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Roman Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|North Africa]], and Sicily, however, could not mount such a resistance, and the Muslim conquerors swept through those regions. At the far west, they crossed the sea taking [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Visigothic Hispania]] before being halted in southern France in the [[Battle of Tours]] by the [[Franks]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Arab Empire]] was the first empire to control the entire Middle East, as well three-quarters of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]], the only other empire besides the Roman Empire to control most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>Subhi Y. Labib (1969), \"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''29''' (1), p. 79\u201396 [80].</ref> It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. The [[Seljuq Empire]] would also later dominate the region.\n\nMuch of North Africa became a peripheral area to the main Muslim centres in the Middle East, but Iberia ([[Al-Andalus]]) and Morocco soon broke away from this distant control and founded one of the world's most advanced societies at the time, along with [[Baghdad]] in the eastern Mediterranean. Between 831 and 1071, the [[Emirate of Sicily]] was one of the major centres of Islamic culture in the Mediterranean. After its conquest by the [[Normans]] the island developed its own distinct culture with the fusion of Arab, Western, and Byzantine influences. [[Palermo]] remained a leading artistic and commercial centre of the Mediterranean well into the Middle Ages.\n\nAfrica was reviving, however, as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later [[Middle Ages]] after the [[Renaissance of the 12th century|Renaissance of the 12th&nbsp;century]]. Motivated by religion and conquest, the kings of Europe launched a number of [[Crusades]] to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the [[Holy Land]]. The Crusades were unsuccessful but were far more effective in weakening the already tottering Byzantine Empire. They also rearranged the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in the Muslim world as Egypt once again emerged as a major power.\n\n===Islamic culture and science===\n{{main|Islamic Golden Age|Early social changes under Islam|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}\n[[File:Interior de la mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the former mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, showing its distinctive arches.]]\n\nReligion always played a prevalent role in Middle Eastern culture, affecting learning, architecture, and the ebb and flow of cultures. When Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture, inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Islam primarily consisted of the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of belief]], including confession of faith, the five prayers a day, to [[Fasting|fast]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]], to pay the tax for charity (the [[zak\u0101t]]), and the [[hajj]], or the pilgrimage that a Muslim needed to take at least once in their lifetime, according to the five (or six) pillars of Islam. Islam also created the need for spectacularly built [[mosque]]s which created a distinct form of architecture. Some of the more magnificent mosques include the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the former [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Mosque of Cordoba]]. Islam unified the Middle East and helped the empires there to remain stable. Missionaries and warriors spread the religion from Arabia to North and Sudanic Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Mesopotamia area. This created a mix of cultures, especially in Africa, and the mawali demographic. Although the mawali would experience discrimination from the Umayyad, they would gain widespread acceptance from the Abbasids and it was because of this that allowed for mass conversions in foreign areas. \"People of the book\" or dhimmi were always treated well; these people included Christians, Jews, [[Hinduism|Hindus]], and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]. However, the crusades started a new thinking in the Islamic empires, that non-Islamic ideas were immoral or inferior; this was primarily perpetrated by the ulama (\u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621) scholars.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=171}}\n\nArabian culture took off during the early Abbasid age, despite the prevalent political issues. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe. The works of [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Euclid]] were saved and distributed throughout the empire (and eventually into Europe) in this manner. Muslim scholars also discovered the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] in their [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|conquests of south Asia]]. The use of this system in Muslim trade and political institutions allowed for the eventual popularization of it around the world; this number system would be critical to the [[Scientific revolution]] in Europe. Muslim intellectuals would become experts in [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[mapmaking]] during the Abbasid Caliphate. In the arts, [[Abbasid architecture]] expanded upon [[Umayyad architecture]], with larger and more extravagant mosques. [[Persian literature]] grew based on ethical values. Astronomy was stressed in art. Much of this learning would find its way to the West. This was especially true during the crusades, as warriors would bring back Muslim treasures, weapons, and medicinal methods.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=159}}\n\n===Turks, Crusaders, and Mongols===\n{{See also|Crusades|History of the Levant|Mongol conquests|History of Jerusalem}}\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. Egypt held out under the [[Fatimid caliph]]s until 1169, when it too fell to the [[Ayyubid Dynasty|Turks]].\n\nDespite massive territorial losses in the 7th century, the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] continued to be a potent military and economic force in the Mediterranean, preventing Arab expansion into much of Europe. The Seljuqs' defeat of the Byzantine military in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in the 11th century and settling in [[Anatolia]] effectively marked the end of Byzantine power. The Seljuks ruled most of the Middle East region for the next 200 years, but their empire soon broke up into a number of smaller sultanates.\n\nChristian Western Europe staged a remarkable economic and demographic recovery in the 11th century since its nadir in the 7th century. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]] responded to pleas from the flagging Byzantine Empire and summoned the European aristocracy to recapture the [[Holy Land]] for Christianity. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291.\n\n====Mongol rule====\n{{main|Ilkhanate|Mongol invasions and conquests#West Asia}}\n\nThe conquest of Baghdad and the death of the caliph in 1258 officiated the end of the Abbasid Caliphate and annexed its territories to the [[Mongol Empire]], excluding Mamluk Egypt and the majority of Arabia.{{sfn|Wawro|2008|pages=146\u2013149}} When the [[Khagan]] (or Great Khan) of the Mongol Empire, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], died in 1259, any further expansion by Hulegu was halted, as he had to return to the Mongol capital [[Karakorum]] for the election of a new khagan. His absence resulted in the first defeat of the Mongols (by the Mamluk Egyptians) during the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260.{{sfn|Guzman|1985|pages=230\u2013233}} Issues began to arise when the Mongols grew increasingly unable to reach a consensus as to whom to elect khagan. Additionally, societal clashing occurred between traditionalists who wished to retain their nomadic culture and Mongols moving towards sedentary agriculture. All of this led to the fragmentation of the empire in 1260.<ref name=\"Rossabi Mongol conquests\">{{cite web|last=Rossabi|first=Morris|title=The Mongol Conquests|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/mongols/conquests/conquests.htm|work=Asian Topics in World History: The Mongols in World History|publisher=Asia for Educators, Columbia University|accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref> Hulegu carved out his Middle Eastern territory into the independent [[Ilkhanate]], which included most of Armenia, Anatolia, Azerbaijan, Mesopotamia, and Iran.\n\nThe Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]]. Based in [[Anatolia]], by 1566 they would conquer the Iraq-Iran region, the Balkans, Greece, Byzantium, most of Egypt, most of north Africa, and parts of Arabia, unifying them under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The rule of the Ottoman sultans marked the end of the Medieval (Postclassical) Era in the Middle East.\n\n==Early Modern Near East==\n{{see|Early modern history}}\n\n===The Ottoman Empire (1299\u20131918)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n{{See also|Ottoman Empire}}\n[[Image:OttomanEmpire1590.png|thumb|The Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent in the Middle East.]]\n[[Image:I Selim.jpg|thumb|[[Selim the Grim]], Ottoman conqueror of the Middle East]]\n[[Image:C) Armenian Girl, Druse, Inhabitant of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Inhabitants of Damascus by the end of the Ottoman era]]\n[[File:Map of the Ottoman empire in 1916 - Banse Ewald - 1919.jpg|300px|thumb|Middle East Map, 1916]]\nBy the early 15th century, a new power had arisen in western Anatolia, the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman khans, who in 1453 captured the Christian Byzantine capitol of Constantinople and made themselves sultans. The Mamluks held the Ottomans out of the Middle East for a century, but in 1514 [[Selim I|Selim the Grim]] began the systematic Ottoman conquest of the region. Syria was occupied in 1516 and Egypt in 1517, extinguishing the Mameluk line. Iraq was conquered almost in 40 years from the Iranian [[Safavids]], who were successors of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]].\n\nThe Ottomans united the whole region under one ruler for the first time since the reign of the [[Abbasid caliphs]] of the 10th century, and they kept control of it for 400 years, despite brief intermissions created by the Iranian Safavids and [[Afsharids]].{{sfn|Quataert|2000}} By this time the Ottomans also held [[Greece]], the [[Balkans]], and most of [[Hungary]], setting the new frontier between east and west far to the north of the [[Danube]].\n\nIn the west, Europe was rapidly expanding, demographically, economically, and culturally. By 1700, the Ottomans had been driven out of Hungary. Although some areas of Ottoman Europe, such as [[Albania]] and [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnia]], saw many conversions to Islam, the area was never culturally absorbed into the Muslim world. From 1768 to 1918, the Ottomans gradually lost territory. By the 19th century, Europe had overtaken the Muslim world in wealth, population, and\u2014most importantly\u2014technology. The [[industrial revolution]] fueled a boom that laid the foundations for the growth of [[capitalism]]. During the 19th century, [[Greece]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], and [[Bulgaria]] claimed independence, and the Ottoman Empire became known as the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\", increasingly under the financial control of European powers. Domination soon turned to outright conquest: the French annexed [[Algeria]] in 1830 and [[Tunisia]] in 1878 and the British occupied Egypt in 1882, though it remained under nominal Ottoman sovereignty. In the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u201313 the Ottomans were driven out of Europe altogether, except for the city of [[Constantinople]] and its hinterland.\n\nThe British also [[British Residency of the Persian Gulf|established effective control]] of the [[Persian Gulf]], and the French extended their influence into [[Lebanon]] and Syria. In 1912, the Italians seized [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese|Dodecanese islands]], just off the coast of the Ottoman heartland of Anatolia. The Ottomans turned to Germany to protect them from the western powers, but the result was increasing financial and military dependence on Germany.\n\n====Ottoman reform efforts====\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Middle Eastern rulers tried to modernize their states to compete more effectively with Europe. In the Ottoman Empire, the [[Tanzimat]] reforms re-invigorated Ottoman rule and were furthered by the [[Young Ottomans]] in the late 19th century, leading to the [[First Constitutional Era]] in the Empire that included the writing of the [[1876 Ottoman constitution|1876 constitution]] and the establishment of the [[Ottoman Parliament]]. The authors of the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|1906 revolution in Persia]] all sought to import versions of the western model of constitutional government, civil law, secular education, and industrial development into their countries. Throughout the region, railways and telegraph lines were constructed, schools and universities were opened, and a new class of army officers, lawyers, teachers, and administrators emerged, challenging the traditional leadership of [[Islamic scholars]].\n\nThis first Ottoman constitutional experiment ended soon after it began, however, when the autocratic Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] abolished the [[Ottoman Parliament|parliament]] and the [[1876 Ottoman constitution|constitution]] in favor of personal rule. Abdul Hamid ruled by decree for the next 30 years, stirring democratic resentment. The reform movement known as the [[Young Turks]] emerged in the 1890s against his rule, which included [[Hamidian massacres|massacres against minorities]]. The Young Turks seized power in the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] and established the [[Second Constitutional Era]], leading to a pluralist and multiparty elections in the Empire for the first time [[1908 Ottoman general election|in 1908]]. The Young Turks split into two parties, the pro-German and pro-centralization [[Committee of Union and Progress]] and the pro-British and pro-decentralization [[Freedom and Accord Party]]. The former was led by an ambitious pair of army officers, [[Enver Pasha|Ismail Enver Bey]] (later Pasha) and [[Djemal Pasha|Ahmed Cemal Pasha]], and a radical lawyer, [[Talaat Pasha|Mehmed Talaat Bey (later Pasha)]]. After a power struggle between the two parties of Young Turks, the Committee [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat|emerged victorious]] and became a ruling junta, with Talaat as Grand Vizier and Enver as War Minister, and established a German-funded modernisation program across the Empire.{{sfn|Mansfield|Pelham|2013|pp=141\u2013147}}\n\nEnver Bey's alliance with Germany, which he considered the most advanced military power in Europe, was enabled by British demands that the Ottoman Empire cede their formal capital [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) to the Bulgarians after losing the [[First Balkan War]], which the Turks saw as a betrayal by Britain.<ref name=\"Z\u00fcrcher\">{{cite book |title=Turkey: A Modern History |author=[[Erik-Jan Z\u00fcrcher]] |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-86064-958-5 |edition=Revised |pages=107 ''ff.''}}</ref> These demands cost Britain the support of the Turks, as the pro-British Freedom and Accord Party was now repressed under the pro-German Committee for, in Enver's words, \"shamefully delivering the country to the enemy\" (Britain) after agreeing to the demands to give up Edirne.<ref name=\"L'Illustration\">{{cite journal |author=Y.R. |date=1 February 1913 |title=Le coup d'\u00e9tat du 23 Janvier |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37526/37526-h/37526-h.htm |journal=[[L'Illustration]] |accessdate=28 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Modern Middle East==\n{{see|Modern history}}\n\n===Final years of the Ottoman Empire===\n{{See also|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Mandatory Palestine|Mandatory Iraq|Modern history of Cyprus|Protectorate of Cyprus|List of modern conflicts in the Middle East}}\n[[Image:Mustafa Kemal November 1918.png|180px|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], Ottoman general and the founder of modern Turkey]]\nIn 1878, as the result of the [[Cyprus Convention]], the United Kingdom took over the government of [[Cyprus]] as a protectorate from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. While the Cypriots at first welcomed [[British Empire|British rule]], hoping that they would gradually achieve prosperity, democracy and national liberation, they soon became disillusioned. The British imposed heavy taxes to cover the compensation they paid to the Sultan for conceding Cyprus to them. Moreover, the people were not given the right to participate in the administration of the island, since all powers were reserved to the [[High Commissioner]] and to London.<ref>{{cite book|last = Tofallis|first = Kypros|title = A history of Cyprus: from the ancient times to the present|page = 98 |date =2002|publisher = Greek Institute|isbn = 9780905313238}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the fall of the Ottomans and the partitioning of Anatolia by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] led to resistance by the Turkish population, under the [[Turkish National Movement]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], the Turkish victory against the invading powers during the [[Turkish War of Independence]], and the founding of the modern [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923. As the first President of Turkey, Atat\u00fcrk embarked on a [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|program of modernisation and secularisation]]. He abolished the [[caliphate]], emancipated women, enforced western dress and the use of a new [[Turkish alphabet]] based on [[Latin script]] in place of the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Arabic alphabet]], and abolished the jurisdiction of the Islamic courts. In effect, Turkey, having given up rule over the Arab world, was now determined to secede from the Middle East and become culturally part of Europe.\n\nAnother turning point came when [[petroleum|oil]] was discovered, first in Persia (1908) and later in [[Saudi Arabia]] (1938) as well as the other Persian Gulf states, [[Libya]], and [[Algeria]]. The Middle East, it turned out, possessed the world's largest easily accessible reserves of [[crude oil]], the most important commodity in the 20th century. While western oil companies pumped and exported nearly all of it to fuel the rapidly expanding automobile industry among other developments, the kings and emirs of these oil states became immensely rich, allowing them to consolidate their hold on power and giving them a stake in preserving western hegemony over the region.<ref name=\"Morton 39\u201354\">{{cite journal|last=Morton |first=Michael Quentin |title=Narrowing the Gulf: Anglo-American Relations and Arabian Oil, 1928\u201374 |journal=Liwa |date=December 2011 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=39\u201354 |url=http://www.ncdr.ae/liwa/issues/LIWA06E.pdf |accessdate=14 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419013816/http://www.ncdr.ae/liwa/issues/LIWA06E.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nA Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil and the decline of British influence led to a growing American interest in the region. Initially, the Western oil companies established a dominance over oil production and extraction. However, indigenous movements towards [[nationalization|nationalizing]] oil assets, oil sharing, and the advent of [[OPEC]] ensured a shift in the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] towards the Arab oil states.<ref name=\"Morton 39\u201354\"/> Oil wealth also had the effect of suffocating whatever economic, political, or social reform might have emerged in the Arab world under the influence of the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|Kemalist revolution]] in Turkey.\n\n===World War I===\n\nIn 1914, [[Enver Pasha]]'s [[Ottoman\u2013German Alliance|alliance with Germany]] led the Ottoman Empire into the fatal step of joining Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[World War I]], against Britain and France. The British saw the Ottomans as the weak link in the enemy alliance, and concentrated on knocking them out of the war. When a direct assault failed at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915, they turned to fomenting revolution in the Ottoman domains, exploiting the awakening force of [[Arab nationalism|Arab]], [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]], and [[Assyrian nationalism]] against the Ottomans.\n\nThe British found an ally in [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]], the hereditary ruler of [[Mecca]] (and believed by Muslims to be a descendant of [[Muhammad]]), who led an [[Arab Revolt]] against Ottoman rule, after being promised independence.\n\nThe Allies, led by Britain, won the war and seized most of the Ottoman territories; Turkey just managed to survive. The war transformed the region in terms of increased British and French involvement; the creation of the Middle Eastern state system as seen in Turkey and Saudi Arabia; the emergence of explicitly more nationalist politics, as seen in Turkey and Egypt; and the rapid growth of the Middle Eastern oil industry.<ref>Matthew F.

In 1920, Syrian forces were defeated by the French in the [[Battle of Maysalun]] and Iraqi forces were defeated by the British when they [[Iraqi revolt against the British|revolted]]. In 1922, the (nominally) independent [[Kingdom of Egypt]] was created following the British government's issuance of the [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence]].\n\nAlthough the Kingdom of Egypt was technically \"neutral\" during World War II, [[Cairo]] soon became a major military base for the British and the country was occupied. The British cited the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] that allowed it to station troops on Egyptian soil to protect the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1941, the [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Rash\u012bd `Al\u012b al-Gayl\u0101n\u012b coup]] in Iraq led to the British to invade, leading to the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]. This was followed by the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|Allied invasion of Syria\u2013Lebanon]] and the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].\n\nIn Palestine, conflicting forces of [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Zionism]] created a situation the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. The rise of German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] had created a new urgency in the Zionist quest to immigrate to Palestine and create a [[Jewish state]]. A Palestinian state was also an attractive alternative to the Arab and Persian leaders, instead of the de facto British, French, and perceived Jewish colonialism or imperialism, under the logic of \"[[the enemy of my enemy is my friend]]\".{{sfn|Lewis|1995|pp=348\u2013350}}\n\n===New states after World War II===\nThe British,<ref>[[Elizabeth Monroe (historian)|Elizabeth Monroe]], ''Britain's Moment in the Middle East, 1914\u20131956'' (1963) [https://www.questia.com/library/954023/britain-s-moment-in-the-middle-east-1914-1956 online]\n</ref> French, and Soviets departed from many parts of the Middle East during and after [[World War II]]. Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the states in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] generally kept their boundaries.  After the war, however, seven Middle East states gained (or regained) their independence:\n* 22 November 1943&nbsp;\u2013 Lebanon\n* 1 January 1944&nbsp;\u2013 Syria\n* 22 May 1946&nbsp;\u2013 Jordan (British mandate ended)\n* 1947&nbsp;\u2013 Iraq (forces of the United Kingdom withdrawn)\n* 1947&nbsp;\u2013 Egypt (forces of the United Kingdom withdrawn to the [[Suez Canal]] area)\n* 1948&nbsp;\u2013 Israel (forces of the United Kingdom withdrawn)\n* August 16, 1960&nbsp;\u2013 Cyprus\n\nThe struggle between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine culminated in the 1947 [[United Nations]] [[1947 UN Partition Plan|plan to partition Palestine]]. This plan sought to create an Arab state and a separate Jewish state in the narrow space between the [[Jordan River]] and the Mediterranean. The Jewish leaders accepted it, but the Arab leaders rejected this plan.\n\nOn 14 May 1948, when the British Mandate expired, the [[Zionist]] leadership declared the [[State of Israel]]. In the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] which immediately followed, the armies of Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia intervened and were defeated by Israel. About 800,000 Palestinians fled from areas annexed by Israel and became [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]] in neighbouring countries, thus creating the \"Palestinian problem\", which has troubled the region ever since. Approximately two-thirds of 758,000\u2013866,000 of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jews expelled or who fled from Arab lands]] after 1948 were absorbed and naturalized by the State of Israel.\n\nOn August 16, 1960, [[Cyprus]] gained its independence from the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]]. Archbishop [[Makarios III]], a charismatic religious and political leader, was elected its first independent president, and in 1961 it became the 99th member of the [[United Nations]].\n\n===Modern states===\n{{See also|Economy of the Middle East|List of modern conflicts in the Middle East}}\n[[File:The Middle East.ogv|thumb|1963 film about contemporary events in the Middle East]]\n\nThe modern Middle East was shaped by three things: departure of European powers, the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|founding of Israel]], and the growing importance of the oil industry. These developments led increased [[United States foreign policy in the Middle East|U.S. involvement in Middle East]]. The United States was the ultimate guarantor of the region's stability as well as the dominant force in the oil industry after the 1950s. When revolutions brought radical [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] regimes to power in Egypt (1954), Syria (1963), Iraq (1968), and [[Libya]] (1969), the [[Soviet Union]], seeking to open a new arena of the [[Cold War]], allied itself with [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] rulers like [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]].\n\nThese regimes gained popular support with promises to destroy the state of Israel, defeat the United States and other \"western imperialists\", and to bring prosperity to the Arab masses. When the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 with Israel ended in a decisive loss for the Muslim side, many viewed defeat as the failure of Arab socialism. This represents a turning point when \"[[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamental]] and [[Islamic terrorism|militant Islam]] began to fill the political vacuum created\".<ref name=\"watson\">Watson, Peter (2006).

New York: Harper Perennial. p. 1096. {{ISBN|0-06-093564-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe United States, in response, felt obliged to defend its remaining allies, the conservative monarchies of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iran, and the Persian Gulf emirates, whose methods of rule were almost as unattractive in western eyes as those of the anti-western regimes. Iran in particular became a key U.S. ally, until a revolution led by the [[Shi'a]] clergy [[Iranian revolution|overthrew the monarchy in 1979]] and established a [[theocracy|theocratic]] regime that was even more anti-western than the secular regimes in Iraq or Syria. This forced the United States into a close alliance with Saudi Arabia. The list of Arab-Israeli wars includes a great number of major wars such as [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], [[1956 Suez War]], 1967 [[Six-Day War]], 1970 [[War of Attrition]], 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], [[1982 Lebanon War]], as well as a number of lesser conflicts.\n\n[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] concluded a peace treaty in 1978.]]\nIn [[Cyprus]] between 1955 and 1974, conflict arising between [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]] led to [[Cypriot intercommunal violence]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. The [[Cyprus dispute]] remains unresolved.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1960s, the [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] led by [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]] took power in both Iraq and Syria. Iraq was first ruled by [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], but was succeeded by [[Saddam Hussein]] in 1979, and Syria was ruled first by a Military Committee led by [[Salah Jadid]], and later [[Hafez al-Assad]] until 2000, when he was succeeded by his son, [[Bashar al-Assad]].\n\nIn 1979, Egypt under Nasser's successor, [[Anwar Sadat]], concluded a peace treaty with Israel, ending the prospects of a united Arab military front. From the 1970s the Palestinians, led by [[Yasser Arafat]]'s [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], resorted to a prolonged campaign of violence against Israel and against American, Jewish, and western targets generally, as a means of weakening Israeli resolve and undermining western support for Israel. The Palestinians were supported in this, to varying degrees, by the regimes in Syria, Libya, Iran, and Iraq. The high point of this campaign came in the 1975 [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] condemning Zionism as a form of racism and the reception given to Arafat by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 4686]].\n\nDue to many of the frantic events of the late 1970s in the Middle East it culminated in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] between neighbouring Iran and Iraq. The war, started by Iraq, who invaded Iranian [[Khuzestan]] in 1980 at the behest of the latter's chaotic state of country due to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, eventually turned into a stalemate with hundreds of thousands of dead on both sides.\n\nThe fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the collapse of [[communism]] in the early 1990s had several consequences for the Middle East. It allowed large numbers of [[Soviet Jews]] to emigrate from [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] to Israel, further strengthening the Jewish state. It cut off the easiest source of credit, armaments, and diplomatic support to the anti-western Arab regimes, weakening their position. It opened up the prospect of cheap oil from Russia, driving down the price of oil and reducing the west's dependence on oil from the Arab states. It discredited the model of development through authoritarian state socialism, which Egypt (under Nasser), Algeria, Syria, and Iraq had followed since the 1960s, leaving these regimes politically and economically stranded. Rulers such as Iraq's Saddam Hussein increasingly relied on [[Arab nationalism]] as a substitute for socialism.\n\nSaddam Hussein led Iraq into a prolonged and [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|costly war with Iran]] from 1980 to 1988, and then into its fateful invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990. Kuwait had been part of the Ottoman province of [[Basra]] before 1918, and thus in a sense part of Iraq, even though Iraq had recognized its [[History of Kuwait#Golden Era (1946\u20131982)|independence in 1961]]. In response, the United States formed a coalition of allies with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria, gained [[United Nations|UN]] approval, and evicted Iraq from Kuwait by force in the [[Gulf War]]. President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.&nbsp;W. Bush]] did not, however, attempt to overthrow Saddam Hussein, which the United States later came to regret.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Gulf War led to a permanent U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, particularly in Saudi Arabia, which offended many Muslims, and was a reason often cited by [[Osama bin Laden]] as justification for the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n===1990s\u2013present===\n[[File:MiddleEast.png|thumb|400px|A map of the Middle East (2003)]]\n\nThe worldwide change of governance in Eastern Europe, Latin America, East Asia, and parts of Africa following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] did not occur in the Middle East. In the whole region, only Israel, Turkey and to some extent Lebanon and the Palestinian territories were considered to be democracies. Some countries had legislative bodies, but these were said to have little power. In the [[Persian Gulf states]] the majority of the population could not vote because they were guest workers rather than citizens.\n\nIn most Middle Eastern countries, the growth of market economies was said to be limited by political restrictions, corruption, and [[cronyism]], overspending on arms and prestige projects and over-dependence on oil revenues. The successful economies were countries that had oil wealth and low populations, such as [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], where the ruling emirs allowed some political and social liberalization, but without giving up any of their own power. Lebanon also rebuilt a fairly successful economy after a prolonged [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] in the 1980s.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, all these factors intensified conflict in the Middle East, which affected the entire world. [[Bill Clinton]]'s failed attempt to broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine at the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David Summit]] in 2000 led directly to the election of [[Ariel Sharon]] as Prime Minister of Israel and to the [[Second Intifada]], which conducted [[suicide bombing]]s on Israeli civilians. This was the first major outbreak of violence since the [[Oslo Peace Accords]] of 1993.\n\nAt the same time, the failures of most of the Arab governments and the bankruptcy of secular Arab radicalism led a section of educated Arabs (and other Muslims) to embrace [[Islamism]], promoted both by Iran's [[Shi'a]] clerics as well as by Saudi Arabia's powerful [[Wahhabist]] sect. Many of the militant Islamists gained their military training while [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|fighting Soviet forces]] in [[Afghanistan]].{{dubious|date=July 2015}} Many of the [[Mujahideen|Afghan jihadists]], though supposedly none of the Arab volunteers, were funded by the United States under [[Operation Cyclone]] as part of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], one of the longest and most expensive [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[covert operations]] ever.<ref name=bergen68>Bergen, Peter, ''Holy War Inc.'', Free Press, (2001), p. 68</ref><ref name=\"Oily\">{{cite news |title=The Oily Americans |date=13 May 2003 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,450997-92,00.html |work=Time |accessdate=2008-07-08 |first1=Donald L. |last1=Barlett |first2=James B. |last2=Steele}}</ref>\n\nOne of these Arab militants was a wealthy Saudi Arabian named [[Osama bin Laden]]. After fighting against the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviets in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, he formed the [[al-Qaida]] organization, which was responsible for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] and the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The September 11 attacks led the [[George W. Bush]] administration to [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invade Afghanistan]] in 2001 to overthrow the [[Taliban]] regime, which had been harbouring Bin Laden and al-Qaida. The United States and its allies described this operation as part of a global \"[[War on Terror]]\".\n\nIn 2002, U.S. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] developed a plan to invade Iraq, remove Saddam from power, and turn Iraq into a democratic state with a free-market economy, which they hoped would serve as a model for the rest of the Middle East. The United States and its principal allies\u2014Britain, Italy, Spain, and Australia\u2014could not secure [[United Nations]] approval for the execution of the numerous UN resolutions, so they launched an invasion of Iraq and deposed Saddam without much difficulty in April 2003.\n\nThe advent of a new western army of occupation in a Middle Eastern capital marked a turning point in the history of the region. Despite successful elections (although boycotted by large portions of Iraq's Sunni population) held in January 2005, much of Iraq had all but disintegrated, due to a post-war insurgency which morphed into persistent ethnic violence that the American army was initially unable to quell. Many of Iraq's intellectual and business elite fled the country, and many Iraqi refugees left as a result of the insurgency, further destabilizing the region. A responsive surge in U.S. forces in Iraq was largely successful in controlling the insurgency and stabilizing the country. U.S. forces [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|withdrew]] from Iraq by December 2011.\n\nBy 2005, President George W. Bush's [[Road map for peace]] between Israel and the Palestinians was stalled, although this situation had begun to change with [[Yasser Arafat]]'s death in 2004. In response, Israel moved towards a unilateral solution, pushing ahead with the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] to protect Israel from Palestinian suicide bombers and proposed unilateral withdrawal from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. The barrier if completed would amount to a ''de facto'' annexation of areas of the [[West Bank]] by Israel. In 2006 a new conflict erupted between Israel and [[Hezbollah]] Shi'a militia in southern Lebanon, further setting back any \"prospects for peace\".\n\nIn the early 2010s, a [[revolutionary wave]] popularly known as the [[Arab Spring]] brought major protests, uprisings, and revolutions to several Middle Eastern countries, followed by prolonged civil wars in [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|Iraq]], [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]], and [[Libyan Civil War (2011\u2013present)|Libya]]. In 2014, a terrorist group and self-proclaimed caliphate calling itself the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] made rapid territorial gains in western Iraq and eastern Syria, prompting [[International military intervention against ISIL|international military intervention]]. At its peak, the group controlled an area containing an estimated 2.8 to 8 million people, 98% of which was lost by December 2017.\n\n== Maps of the Middle East from 1910 to 2010 ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1910.png|The Middle East in 1910 <br /> (Before [[ww1]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1920.png|1920 <br /> (After [[ww1]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1930.png|1930 <br /> (Before [[ww2]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1940.png|1940 <br /> (During [[ww2]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1950.png|1950 <br /> (After [[ww2]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1960.png|1960\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1970.png|1970\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1980.png|1980\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1990.png|1990\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_2000.png|2000\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_2010.png|2010\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of history journals#Middle East]]\n* [[Middle Eastern Empires]]\n* [[Timeline of Middle Eastern history]]\n* The [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises]]\n* [[British foreign policy in the Middle East]]\n* [[United States foreign policy in the Middle East]]\n'''By country:'''\n* [[History of Armenia]]\n* [[History of Azerbaijan]]\n* [[History of Bahrain]]\n* [[History of Egypt]]\n* [[History of Georgia (country)|History of Georgia]]\n* [[History of Iran]]\n* [[History of Iraq]]\n* [[History of Israel]]\n* [[History of Jordan]]\n* [[History of Kuwait]]\n* [[History of Lebanon]]\n* [[History of Oman]]\n* [[History of Palestine]]\n* [[History of Qatar]]\n* [[History of Saudi Arabia]]\n* [[History of Syria]]\n* [[History of Turkey]]\n* [[History of the United Arab Emirates]]\n* [[History of Yemen]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[History of North Africa]]\n* [[History of Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Works cited'''\n* {{citation|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=The Oxford History of Islam|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-19-510799-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imw_KFD5bsQC&pg=PR7|edition=Illustrated|authorlink=John Esposito}}\n* {{citation|last=Guzman|first=Gregory|title=Christian Europe and Mongol Asia: First Medieval Intercultural Contact Between East and West|journal=Essays in Medieval Studies|year=1985|volume=2|url=http://www.illinoismedieval.org/EMS/EMSpdf/V2/V2Guzman.pdf}}\n* {{citation|last=Hourani|first=Albert|title=A History of the Arab Peoples|year=2013|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=978-0-571-30249-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irtb55WDsjMC|edition=Updated|authorlink=Albert Hourani}}\n* {{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|year=2007|title=A Brief History of the World|publisher=[[The Teaching Company]]|authorlink=Peter Stearns}}\n* {{citation|last=Wawro|first=Geoffrey|title=Historical Atlas: A Comprehensive History of the World|year=2008|publisher=Millennium House|location=Elanora Heights, NSW, Australia|isbn=978-1-921209-23-9|authorlink=Geoffrey Wawro}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Cheta, Omar Youssef. \"The economy by other means: The historiography of capitalism in the modern Middle East.\" ''History Compass'' (April 2018) 16#4 DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12444\n* Cleveland, William L. and Martin Bunton.

From the early 7th century BC and onwards, the Iranian [[Medes]] followed by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and other subsequent Iranian states and empires dominated the region. In the 1st century BC, the expanding [[Roman Republic]] absorbed the whole [[Eastern Mediterranean]], which included much of the [[Near East]]. The Eastern Roman Empire, today commonly known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], ruling from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Euphrates]], became increasingly defined by and dogmatic about [[Christianity]], gradually creating religious rifts between the doctrines dictated by the establishment in [[Constantinople]] and believers in many parts of the Middle East. From the 3rd century up to the course of the 7th century&nbsp;AD, the entire Middle East was dominated by the Byzantines and the [[Sasanian Empire]]. From the 7th century, a new power was rising in the Middle East, that of [[Islam]]. The dominance of the [[Arabs]] came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq dynasty]]. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], mainly [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], swept through the region. By the early 15th century, a new power had arisen in western Anatolia, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emirs, linguistically Turkic and religiously Islamic, who in [[Fall of Constantinople|1453 captured the Christian Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] and made themselves [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|sultans]].\n\nLarge parts of the Middle East became a warground between the Ottomans and the Iranian [[Safavid dynasty]] for centuries, starting in the early 16th century. By 1700, the Ottomans had been driven out of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] along the frontier had shifted decisively in favor of the [[Western world]]. The [[British Empire]] also established effective control of the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[French colonial empire]] extended its influence into [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]]. In 1912, the [[Kingdom of Italy]] seized [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese|Dodecanese islands]], just off the coast of the Ottoman heartland of [[Anatolia]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Middle Eastern rulers tried to modernize their states to compete more effectively with the European powers. A turning point in the '''history of the Middle East''' came when [[petroleum|oil]] was discovered, first in Persia in 1908 and later in [[Saudi Arabia]] (in 1938) and the other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]], and also in [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]]. A Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil and the decline of British influence led to a growing American interest in the region.\n\nDuring the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, Syria and Egypt made moves towards independence. The British, the French, and the [[Soviet Union]] departed from many parts of the Middle East during and after [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945). The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] culminated in the 1947 [[United Nations]] [[1947 UN Partition Plan|plan to partition Palestine]]. Later in the midst of [[Cold War]] tensions, the Arabic-speaking countries of [[Western Asia]] and [[Northern Africa]] saw the rise of [[pan-Arabism]]. The departure of the European powers from direct control of the region, the establishment of [[Israel]], and the increasing importance of the [[petroleum industry]], marked the creation of the modern Middle East. In most Middle Eastern countries, the growth of market economies was inhibited by political restrictions, corruption and [[cronyism]], overspending on arms and prestige projects, and over-dependence on oil revenues.

The [[Fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 brought a global security refocus from the [[Cold War]] to a [[War on Terror]]. Starting in the early 2010s, a [[revolutionary wave]] popularly known as the [[Arab Spring]] brought major protests, uprisings, and revolutions to several Middle Eastern and [[Maghreb]] countries.

The Middle East was the first to experience a [[Neolithic Revolution]] (c. the 10th millennium BC), as well as the first to enter the [[Bronze Age]] (c. 3300\u20131200 BC) and [[Iron Age]] (c. 1200\u2013500 BC).\n\nHistorically human populations have tended to settle around bodies of water, which is reflected in modern population density patterns. [[Irrigation]] systems were extremely important for the agricultural Middle East: for Egypt that of the lower [[Nile River]], and for Mesopotamia that of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. Levantine agriculture depended on [[precipitation]] rather than on the river-based irrigation of Egypt and Mesopotamia, resulting in preference for different crops. Since travel was faster and easier by sea, civilizations along the [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Phoenicia]] and later Greece, participated in intense trade. Similarly, [[History of Yemen#Ancient history|Ancient Yemen]], much more conducive to agriculture than the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, sea traded heavily with the [[Horn of Africa]], some of which it lingually Semitized. The [[Adnanite]] Arabs, inhabiting the drier desert areas of the Middle East, were all [[nomadic]] [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] before some began settling in [[city state]]s, with the geo-linguistic distribution today being divided between [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Najd]] and the [[Hejaz]] in the Peninsula, as well as the [[Bedouin]] areas beyond the Peninsula.\n\nSince ancient times the Middle East has had several [[lingua franca]]: [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ({{circa}} 14th\u20138th century BC), [[Aramaic]] ({{circa}} 8th century BC&nbsp;\u2013 8th century AD),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader|first1=Suzanne|last1=Richard|edition=Illustrated|publisher=EISENBRAUNS|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57506-083-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=khR0apPid8gC&pg=PA69 |page=69}}</ref> [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{circa}} 4th century BC&nbsp;\u2013 8th century AD), and [[Arabic]] ({{circa}} 8th century AD&nbsp;\u2013 present).

Initially the ancient inhabitants of the region followed various [[ethnic religion]]s, but most of those began to be gradually replaced at first by Christianity (even before the 313 AD [[Edict of Milan]]) and finally by Islam (after the spread of the [[Muslim conquests]] beyond the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in 634 AD). To this day, however, the Middle East has, in particular, some [[Christianity in the Middle East|sizable, ethnically distinct Christian minority groups]], as well as Jews, concentrated in Israel, and followers of Iranian religions, such as [[Yazd\u00e2nism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]. Some of the smaller [[ethnoreligious]] minorities include the [[Shabak people]], the [[Mandaeans]] and the [[Samaritans]].

However, its empires also introduced rigid [[social stratification]], [[slavery]], and organized [[warfare]].\n\n===Cradle of civilization, Sumer and Akkad===\nThe earliest [[civilization]]s in history were established in the region now known as the Middle East around 3500 BC by the [[Sumer]]ians, in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]), widely regarded as the [[cradle of civilization]]. The [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], and later [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] all flourished in this region.\n\n\"In the course of the fourth millennium BC, city-states developed in southern Mesopotamia that were dominated by temples whose priests represented the cities' patron deities. The most prominent of the city-states was Sumer, which gave its language to the area, [presumably the [[History of writing|first written language]],] and became the first great civilization of mankind. About 2340 BC, [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon the Great]] (c. 2360\u20132305 BC) united the city-states in the south and founded the Akkadian dynasty, the world's first empire.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6308/1/Ancient-Civilizations--Mesopotamia.html|title=Ancient Civilizations&nbsp;\u2013 Mesopotamia|first=Albert S.|last=Lyons|publisher=Health Guidance.org|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring this same time period, Sargon the Great appointed his daughter, [[Enheduanna]], as High Priestess of Inanna at Ur.<ref>http://www.ancient.eu/akkad/</ref> Her writings, which established her as the first known author in world history, also helped cement Sargon's position in the region.\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Ancient Egypt}}\nSoon after the Sumerian civilization began, the [[Nile valley]] of [[Lower Egypt|Lower]] and [[Upper Egypt]] was unified under the [[Pharaoh]]s approximately around 3150 BC.

Ancient Levantine kingdoms and city states included [[Ebla]] City, [[Ugarit]] City, [[Aram-Damascus|Kingdom of Aram-Damascus]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah]], [[Kingdom of Ammon]], [[Kingdom of Moab]], [[Kingdom of Edom]], and the [[Nabatean kingdom]]. The [[Phoenicia]]n civilization, encompassing several city states, was a [[Thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that established [[Colony|colonial]] cities in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], most notably [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage, in 814 BC]].\n\n===Assyrian empires===\n{{Main|Assyria}}\n[[Mesopotamia]] was home to several powerful empires that came to rule almost the entire Middle East\u2014particularly the [[Assyrian Empire]]s of 1365\u20131076 BC and the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] of 911\u2013605 BC. The Assyrian Empire, at its peak, was the largest the world had seen. It ruled all of what is now Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Cyprus, and Bahrain\u2014with large swathes of Iran, Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Sudan, and Arabia.\n\"The Assyrian empires, particularly the third, had a profound and lasting impact on the Near East. Before Assyrian hegemony ended, the Assyrians brought the highest civilization to the then known world.

This empire dominated sizable parts of what is now the Asian part of the Middle East and continued to influence the rest of the Asiatic and African Middle East region, until the Arab [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th&nbsp;century AD. Between the 1st century BC and the early 7th century AD, the region was completely dominated by the Romans and the Parthians and Sassanids on the other hand, which often culminated in various [[Roman-Persian Wars]] over the seven centuries. Eastern Rite, [[Church of the East]] Christianity took hold in [[Asorestan|Persian-ruled Mesopotamia]], particularly in [[Assyria]] from the 1st century AD onwards, and the region became a center of a flourishing [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]]\u2013[[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] literary tradition.\n\n===Greek and Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Macedonian Empire|Roman Empire}}\n[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|right|240px|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent, under [[Trajan]], 117 AD]]\nIn 66\u201363 BC, the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Pompey]] conquered much of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Brief History of the Middle East |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krKeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false|first = Christopher|last = Catherwood |publisher = Little, Brown Book Group|date = 2011|isbn = 9781849018074}}</ref> The [[Roman Empire]] united the region with most of Europe and North Africa in a single political and economic unit.

By the 5th century, Christianity was the dominant religion in the Middle East, with other faiths (gradually including ''[[heresy|heretical]]'' Christian sects) being actively repressed. The Middle East's ties to the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] were gradually severed as the Empire [[Roman Empire#Partition of the Empire|split]] into [[Byzantine Empire|East]] and [[Western Roman Empire|West]], with the Middle East tied to the new Roman capital of [[Constantinople]]. The subsequent [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] therefore, had minimal direct impact on the region.\n\n====Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire)====\n{{Main|Byzantine Empire}}\nThe Eastern Roman Empire, today commonly known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], ruling from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Euphrates]], became increasingly defined by and dogmatic about Christianity, gradually creating religious rifts between the doctrines dictated by the establishment in Constantinople and believers in many parts of the Middle East. By this time, Greek had become the 'lingua franca' of the region, although ethnicities such as the Syriacs and the Hebrew continued to exist. Under Byzantine/Greek rule the area of the [[Levant]] met an era of stability and prosperity.\n\n==Post-classical Middle East{{anchor|Medieval Near East|Post-classical Middle East}}==\n{{see|Post-classical history}}\n\n===Pre-Islam===\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The Byzantine-Sasanian rivalry was also seen through their respective cultures and religions. The Byzantines considered themselves champions of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] and Christianity. Meanwhile, the Sasanians thought themselves heroes of ancient Iranian traditions and of the traditional Persian religion, [[Zoroastrianism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Esposito|1999|pages=1\u20135}}, for the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian rivalry and its cultural/religious overtones.</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman-Persian_Frontier,_5th_century.png|thumb|Map of the Roman\u2013Persian frontier after the division of Armenia in 384.

While Byzantium allied itself with the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] in the horn of Africa, the Sasanian Empire assisted the [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in what is now [[Yemen]] (southwest Arabia). Thus the clash between the kingdoms of Aksum and Himyar in 525 displayed a higher power struggle between Byzantium and Persia for control of the [[Red Sea]] trade. Territorial wars soon became common, with the Byzantines and Sasanians fighting over upper [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Armenia]] and key cities that facilitated trade from Arabia, India, and China.<ref>{{harvnb|Esposito|1999|pages=1\u20135}}, for the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian struggle with Aksum and Himyar, as well as the territorial wars and focus on trade.</ref> Byzantium, as the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire, continued control of the latter's territories in the Middle East. Since 527, this included Anatolia, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Egypt]]. But in 603 the Sasanians invaded, conquering Damascus and Egypt. It was Emperor [[Heraclius]] who was able to repel these invasions, and in 628 he replaced the Sasanian Great King with a more docile one.

Urbanization and agriculture was limited in Arabia, save for a few regions near the coast. [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] (then called Yathrib) were two such cities that were important hubs for trade between Africa and Eurasia. This commerce was central to city-life, where most inhabitants were merchants.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=138}} Nevertheless, some Arabs saw it fit to migrate to the northern regions of the [[Fertile Crescent]], a Persian region so named for its place between the [[Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system|Tigris and Euphrates rivers]] that offered it fertile land. This included entire tribal chiefdoms such as the [[Lakhmids]] in a less controlled area of the Sasanian Empire, and the [[Ghassanids]] in a similar area inside of Byzantine territory; these political units of Arab origin offered a surprising stability that was rare in the region and offered Arabia further connections to the outside world. The Lakhmid capital, [[Al-Hirah|Hira]] was a center for Christianity and Jewish craftsmen, merchants, and farmers were common in western Arabia as were Christian monks in central Arabia.

Labib (1969), \"Capitalism in Medieval Islam\", ''The Journal of Economic History'' '''29''' (1), p. 79\u201396 [80].</ref> It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. The [[Seljuq Empire]] would also later dominate the region.\n\nMuch of North Africa became a peripheral area to the main Muslim centres in the Middle East, but Iberia ([[Al-Andalus]]) and Morocco soon broke away from this distant control and founded one of the world's most advanced societies at the time, along with [[Baghdad]] in the eastern Mediterranean. Between 831 and 1071, the [[Emirate of Sicily]] was one of the major centres of Islamic culture in the Mediterranean. After its conquest by the [[Normans]] the island developed its own distinct culture with the fusion of Arab, Western, and Byzantine influences. [[Palermo]] remained a leading artistic and commercial centre of the Mediterranean well into the Middle Ages.\n\nAfrica was reviving, however, as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later [[Middle Ages]] after the [[Renaissance of the 12th century|Renaissance of the 12th&nbsp;century]]. Motivated by religion and conquest, the kings of Europe launched a number of [[Crusades]] to try to roll back Muslim power and retake the [[Holy Land]]. The Crusades were unsuccessful but were far more effective in weakening the already tottering Byzantine Empire. They also rearranged the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in the Muslim world as Egypt once again emerged as a major power.\n\n===Islamic culture and science===\n{{main|Islamic Golden Age|Early social changes under Islam|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}\n[[File:Interior de la mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the former mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, showing its distinctive arches.]]\n\nReligion always played a prevalent role in Middle Eastern culture, affecting learning, architecture, and the ebb and flow of cultures. When Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture, inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Islam primarily consisted of the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of belief]], including confession of faith, the five prayers a day, to [[Fasting|fast]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]], to pay the tax for charity (the [[zak\u0101t]]), and the [[hajj]], or the pilgrimage that a Muslim needed to take at least once in their lifetime, according to the five (or six) pillars of Islam. Islam also created the need for spectacularly built [[mosque]]s which created a distinct form of architecture. Some of the more magnificent mosques include the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the former [[Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba|Mosque of Cordoba]]. Islam unified the Middle East and helped the empires there to remain stable. Missionaries and warriors spread the religion from Arabia to North and Sudanic Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the Mesopotamia area. This created a mix of cultures, especially in Africa, and the mawali demographic. Although the mawali would experience discrimination from the Umayyad, they would gain widespread acceptance from the Abbasids and it was because of this that allowed for mass conversions in foreign areas. \"People of the book\" or dhimmi were always treated well; these people included Christians, Jews, [[Hinduism|Hindus]], and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]]. However, the crusades started a new thinking in the Islamic empires, that non-Islamic ideas were immoral or inferior; this was primarily perpetrated by the ulama (\u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621) scholars.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=171}}\n\nArabian culture took off during the early Abbasid age, despite the prevalent political issues. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe. The works of [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Euclid]] were saved and distributed throughout the empire (and eventually into Europe) in this manner. Muslim scholars also discovered the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] in their [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|conquests of south Asia]]. The use of this system in Muslim trade and political institutions allowed for the eventual popularization of it around the world; this number system would be critical to the [[Scientific revolution]] in Europe. Muslim intellectuals would become experts in [[chemistry]], [[optics]], and [[mapmaking]] during the Abbasid Caliphate. In the arts, [[Abbasid architecture]] expanded upon [[Umayyad architecture]], with larger and more extravagant mosques. [[Persian literature]] grew based on ethical values. Astronomy was stressed in art. Much of this learning would find its way to the West. This was especially true during the crusades, as warriors would bring back Muslim treasures, weapons, and medicinal methods.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|page=159}}\n\n===Turks, Crusaders, and Mongols===\n{{See also|Crusades|History of the Levant|Mongol conquests|History of Jerusalem}}\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. Egypt held out under the [[Fatimid caliph]]s until 1169, when it too fell to the [[Ayyubid Dynasty|Turks]].\n\nDespite massive territorial losses in the 7th century, the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] continued to be a potent military and economic force in the Mediterranean, preventing Arab expansion into much of Europe. The Seljuqs' defeat of the Byzantine military in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in the 11th century and settling in [[Anatolia]] effectively marked the end of Byzantine power. The Seljuks ruled most of the Middle East region for the next 200 years, but their empire soon broke up into a number of smaller sultanates.\n\nChristian Western Europe staged a remarkable economic and demographic recovery in the 11th century since its nadir in the 7th century. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1095, [[Pope Urban II]] responded to pleas from the flagging Byzantine Empire and summoned the European aristocracy to recapture the [[Holy Land]] for Christianity. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291.\n\n====Mongol rule====\n{{main|Ilkhanate|Mongol invasions and conquests#West Asia}}\n\nThe conquest of Baghdad and the death of the caliph in 1258 officiated the end of the Abbasid Caliphate and annexed its territories to the [[Mongol Empire]], excluding Mamluk Egypt and the majority of Arabia.{{sfn|Wawro|2008|pages=146\u2013149}} When the [[Khagan]] (or Great Khan) of the Mongol Empire, [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]], died in 1259, any further expansion by Hulegu was halted, as he had to return to the Mongol capital [[Karakorum]] for the election of a new khagan. His absence resulted in the first defeat of the Mongols (by the Mamluk Egyptians) during the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] in 1260.{{sfn|Guzman|1985|pages=230\u2013233}} Issues began to arise when the Mongols grew increasingly unable to reach a consensus as to whom to elect khagan. Additionally, societal clashing occurred between traditionalists who wished to retain their nomadic culture and Mongols moving towards sedentary agriculture. All of this led to the fragmentation of the empire in 1260.<ref name=\"Rossabi Mongol conquests\">{{cite web|last=Rossabi|first=Morris|title=The Mongol Conquests|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/mongols/conquests/conquests.htm|work=Asian Topics in World History: The Mongols in World History|publisher=Asia for Educators, Columbia University|accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref> Hulegu carved out his Middle Eastern territory into the independent [[Ilkhanate]], which included most of Armenia, Anatolia, Azerbaijan, Mesopotamia, and Iran.\n\nThe Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]]. Based in [[Anatolia]], by 1566 they would conquer the Iraq-Iran region, the Balkans, Greece, Byzantium, most of Egypt, most of north Africa, and parts of Arabia, unifying them under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The rule of the Ottoman sultans marked the end of the Medieval (Postclassical) Era in the Middle East.\n\n==Early Modern Near East==\n{{see|Early modern history}}\n\n===The Ottoman Empire (1299\u20131918)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n{{See also|Ottoman Empire}}\n[[Image:OttomanEmpire1590.png|thumb|The Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent in the Middle East.]]\n[[Image:I Selim.jpg|thumb|[[Selim the Grim]], Ottoman conqueror of the Middle East]]\n[[Image:C) Armenian Girl, Druse, Inhabitant of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Inhabitants of Damascus by the end of the Ottoman era]]\n[[File:Map of the Ottoman empire in 1916 - Banse Ewald - 1919.jpg|300px|thumb|Middle East Map, 1916]]\nBy the early 15th century, a new power had arisen in western Anatolia, the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman khans, who in 1453 captured the Christian Byzantine capitol of Constantinople and made themselves sultans. The Mamluks held the Ottomans out of the Middle East for a century, but in 1514 [[Selim I|Selim the Grim]] began the systematic Ottoman conquest of the region. Syria was occupied in 1516 and Egypt in 1517, extinguishing the Mameluk line. Iraq was conquered almost in 40 years from the Iranian [[Safavids]], who were successors of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]].\n\nThe Ottomans united the whole region under one ruler for the first time since the reign of the [[Abbasid caliphs]] of the 10th century, and they kept control of it for 400 years, despite brief intermissions created by the Iranian Safavids and [[Afsharids]].{{sfn|Quataert|2000}} By this time the Ottomans also held [[Greece]], the [[Balkans]], and most of [[Hungary]], setting the new frontier between east and west far to the north of the [[Danube]].\n\nIn the west, Europe was rapidly expanding, demographically, economically, and culturally. By 1700, the Ottomans had been driven out of Hungary. Although some areas of Ottoman Europe, such as [[Albania]] and [[Bosnia Eyalet|Bosnia]], saw many conversions to Islam, the area was never culturally absorbed into the Muslim world. From 1768 to 1918, the Ottomans gradually lost territory. By the 19th century, Europe had overtaken the Muslim world in wealth, population, and\u2014most importantly\u2014technology. The [[industrial revolution]] fueled a boom that laid the foundations for the growth of [[capitalism]]. During the 19th century, [[Greece]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], and [[Bulgaria]] claimed independence, and the Ottoman Empire became known as the \"[[sick man of Europe]]\", increasingly under the financial control of European powers. Domination soon turned to outright conquest: the French annexed [[Algeria]] in 1830 and [[Tunisia]] in 1878 and the British occupied Egypt in 1882, though it remained under nominal Ottoman sovereignty. In the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u201313 the Ottomans were driven out of Europe altogether, except for the city of [[Constantinople]] and its hinterland.\n\nThe British also [[British Residency of the Persian Gulf|established effective control]] of the [[Persian Gulf]], and the French extended their influence into [[Lebanon]] and Syria. In 1912, the Italians seized [[Libya]] and the [[Dodecanese|Dodecanese islands]], just off the coast of the Ottoman heartland of Anatolia. The Ottomans turned to Germany to protect them from the western powers, but the result was increasing financial and military dependence on Germany.\n\n====Ottoman reform efforts====\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Middle Eastern rulers tried to modernize their states to compete more effectively with Europe. In the Ottoman Empire, the [[Tanzimat]] reforms re-invigorated Ottoman rule and were furthered by the [[Young Ottomans]] in the late 19th century, leading to the [[First Constitutional Era]] in the Empire that included the writing of the [[1876 Ottoman constitution|1876 constitution]] and the establishment of the [[Ottoman Parliament]]. The authors of the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|1906 revolution in Persia]] all sought to import versions of the western model of constitutional government, civil law, secular education, and industrial development into their countries. Throughout the region, railways and telegraph lines were constructed, schools and universities were opened, and a new class of army officers, lawyers, teachers, and administrators emerged, challenging the traditional leadership of [[Islamic scholars]].\n\nThis first Ottoman constitutional experiment ended soon after it began, however, when the autocratic Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] abolished the [[Ottoman Parliament|parliament]] and the [[1876 Ottoman constitution|constitution]] in favor of personal rule. Abdul Hamid ruled by decree for the next 30 years, stirring democratic resentment. The reform movement known as the [[Young Turks]] emerged in the 1890s against his rule, which included [[Hamidian massacres|massacres against minorities]]. The Young Turks seized power in the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] and established the [[Second Constitutional Era]], leading to a pluralist and multiparty elections in the Empire for the first time [[1908 Ottoman general election|in 1908]]. The Young Turks split into two parties, the pro-German and pro-centralization [[Committee of Union and Progress]] and the pro-British and pro-decentralization [[Freedom and Accord Party]]. The former was led by an ambitious pair of army officers, [[Enver Pasha|Ismail Enver Bey]] (later Pasha) and [[Djemal Pasha|Ahmed Cemal Pasha]], and a radical lawyer, [[Talaat Pasha|Mehmed Talaat Bey (later Pasha)]]. After a power struggle between the two parties of Young Turks, the Committee [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat|emerged victorious]] and became a ruling junta, with Talaat as Grand Vizier and Enver as War Minister, and established a German-funded modernisation program across the Empire.{{sfn|Mansfield|Pelham|2013|pp=141\u2013147}}\n\nEnver Bey's alliance with Germany, which he considered the most advanced military power in Europe, was enabled by British demands that the Ottoman Empire cede their formal capital [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) to the Bulgarians after losing the [[First Balkan War]], which the Turks saw as a betrayal by Britain.<ref name=\"Z\u00fcrcher\">{{cite book |title=Turkey: A Modern History |author=[[Erik-Jan Z\u00fcrcher]] |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-86064-958-5 |edition=Revised |pages=107 ''ff.''}}</ref> These demands cost Britain the support of the Turks, as the pro-British Freedom and Accord Party was now repressed under the pro-German Committee for, in Enver's words, \"shamefully delivering the country to the enemy\" (Britain) after agreeing to the demands to give up Edirne.<ref name=\"L'Illustration\">{{cite journal |author=Y.R. |date=1 February 1913 |title=Le coup d'\u00e9tat du 23 Janvier |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37526/37526-h/37526-h.htm |journal=[[L'Illustration]] |accessdate=28 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Modern Middle East==\n{{see|Modern history}}\n\n===Final years of the Ottoman Empire===\n{{See also|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Mandatory Palestine|Mandatory Iraq|Modern history of Cyprus|Protectorate of Cyprus|List of modern conflicts in the Middle East}}\n[[Image:Mustafa Kemal November 1918.png|180px|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], Ottoman general and the founder of modern Turkey]]\nIn 1878, as the result of the [[Cyprus Convention]], the United Kingdom took over the government of [[Cyprus]] as a protectorate from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. While the Cypriots at first welcomed [[British Empire|British rule]], hoping that they would gradually achieve prosperity, democracy and national liberation, they soon became disillusioned. The British imposed heavy taxes to cover the compensation they paid to the Sultan for conceding Cyprus to them. Moreover, the people were not given the right to participate in the administration of the island, since all powers were reserved to the [[High Commissioner]] and to London.<ref>{{cite book|last = Tofallis|first = Kypros|title = A history of Cyprus: from the ancient times to the present|page = 98 |date =2002|publisher = Greek Institute|isbn = 9780905313238}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the fall of the Ottomans and the partitioning of Anatolia by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] led to resistance by the Turkish population, under the [[Turkish National Movement]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], the Turkish victory against the invading powers during the [[Turkish War of Independence]], and the founding of the modern [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923. As the first President of Turkey, Atat\u00fcrk embarked on a [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|program of modernisation and secularisation]]. He abolished the [[caliphate]], emancipated women, enforced western dress and the use of a new [[Turkish alphabet]] based on [[Latin script]] in place of the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Arabic alphabet]], and abolished the jurisdiction of the Islamic courts. In effect, Turkey, having given up rule over the Arab world, was now determined to secede from the Middle East and become culturally part of Europe.\n\nAnother turning point came when [[petroleum|oil]] was discovered, first in Persia (1908) and later in [[Saudi Arabia]] (1938) as well as the other Persian Gulf states, [[Libya]], and [[Algeria]]. The Middle East, it turned out, possessed the world's largest easily accessible reserves of [[crude oil]], the most important commodity in the 20th century. While western oil companies pumped and exported nearly all of it to fuel the rapidly expanding automobile industry among other developments, the kings and emirs of these oil states became immensely rich, allowing them to consolidate their hold on power and giving them a stake in preserving western hegemony over the region.<ref name=\"Morton 39\u201354\">{{cite journal|last=Morton |first=Michael Quentin |title=Narrowing the Gulf: Anglo-American Relations and Arabian Oil, 1928\u201374 |journal=Liwa |date=December 2011 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=39\u201354 |url=http://www.ncdr.ae/liwa/issues/LIWA06E.pdf |accessdate=14 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419013816/http://www.ncdr.ae/liwa/issues/LIWA06E.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nA Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil and the decline of British influence led to a growing American interest in the region. Initially, the Western oil companies established a dominance over oil production and extraction. However, indigenous movements towards [[nationalization|nationalizing]] oil assets, oil sharing, and the advent of [[OPEC]] ensured a shift in the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] towards the Arab oil states.<ref name=\"Morton 39\u201354\"/> Oil wealth also had the effect of suffocating whatever economic, political, or social reform might have emerged in the Arab world under the influence of the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|Kemalist revolution]] in Turkey.\n\n===World War I===\n\nIn 1914, [[Enver Pasha]]'s [[Ottoman\u2013German Alliance|alliance with Germany]] led the Ottoman Empire into the fatal step of joining Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[World War I]], against Britain and France. The British saw the Ottomans as the weak link in the enemy alliance, and concentrated on knocking them out of the war. When a direct assault failed at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] in 1915, they turned to fomenting revolution in the Ottoman domains, exploiting the awakening force of [[Arab nationalism|Arab]], [[Armenian nationalism|Armenian]], and [[Assyrian nationalism]] against the Ottomans.\n\nThe British found an ally in [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]], the hereditary ruler of [[Mecca]] (and believed by Muslims to be a descendant of [[Muhammad]]), who led an [[Arab Revolt]] against Ottoman rule, after being promised independence.\n\nThe Allies, led by Britain, won the war and seized most of the Ottoman territories; Turkey just managed to survive. The war transformed the region in terms of increased British and French involvement; the creation of the Middle Eastern state system as seen in Turkey and Saudi Arabia; the emergence of explicitly more nationalist politics, as seen in Turkey and Egypt; and the rapid growth of the Middle Eastern oil industry.<ref>Matthew F.

The British in 1917 announced the [[Balfour Declaration]] promised the international [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement their support in re-creating the historic Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\nWhen the Ottomans departed, the Arabs proclaimed an independent state in [[Damascus]], but were too weak, militarily and economically, to resist the European powers for long, and Britain and France soon established control and re-arranged the Middle East to suit themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crethiplethi.com/the-sykes-picot-agreement-1916/historical-documents/2009/|title=Skyes Picot Agreement: Division of Territory|year=2009|publisher=Crethi Plethi|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Syria]] became a French protectorate as a [[League of Nations mandate]].

The Jewish population of Palestine which numbered less than 8 percent in 1918 was given free rein to immigrate, buy land from absentee landlords, set up a shadow government in waiting and establish the nucleus of a state under the protection of the British Army which suppressed a Palestinian revolt in 1936.<ref>{{cite book|first = Justin|last = McCarthy|title = The Population of Palestine: Population History and Statistics of the Late Ottoman Period and the Mandate|date = 1990|publisher = Columbia University Press|isbn = 9780231939782}}</ref> Most of the Arabian peninsula fell to another British ally, [[Ibn Saud]].

While Zaghloul would later become Prime Minister, the British repression of the anticolonial riots led to around 800 deaths. In 1920, Syrian forces were defeated by the French in the [[Battle of Maysalun]] and Iraqi forces were defeated by the British when they [[Iraqi revolt against the British|revolted]]. In 1922, the (nominally) independent [[Kingdom of Egypt]] was created following the British government's issuance of the [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence]].\n\nAlthough the Kingdom of Egypt was technically \"neutral\" during World War II, [[Cairo]] soon became a major military base for the British and the country was occupied. The British cited the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936|1936 treaty]] that allowed it to station troops on Egyptian soil to protect the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1941, the [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|Rash\u012bd `Al\u012b al-Gayl\u0101n\u012b coup]] in Iraq led to the British to invade, leading to the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]. This was followed by the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|Allied invasion of Syria\u2013Lebanon]] and the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]].\n\nIn Palestine, conflicting forces of [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Zionism]] created a situation the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. The rise of German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] had created a new urgency in the Zionist quest to immigrate to Palestine and create a [[Jewish state]]. A Palestinian state was also an attractive alternative to the Arab and Persian leaders, instead of the de facto British, French, and perceived Jewish colonialism or imperialism, under the logic of \"[[the enemy of my enemy is my friend]]\".{{sfn|Lewis|1995|pp=348\u2013350}}\n\n===New states after World War II===\nThe British,<ref>[[Elizabeth Monroe (historian)|Elizabeth Monroe]], ''Britain's Moment in the Middle East, 1914\u20131956'' (1963) [https://www.questia.com/library/954023/britain-s-moment-in-the-middle-east-1914-1956 online]\n</ref> French, and Soviets departed from many parts of the Middle East during and after [[World War II]].

This plan sought to create an Arab state and a separate Jewish state in the narrow space between the [[Jordan River]] and the Mediterranean. The Jewish leaders accepted it, but the Arab leaders rejected this plan.\n\nOn 14 May 1948, when the British Mandate expired, the [[Zionist]] leadership declared the [[State of Israel]]. In the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] which immediately followed, the armies of Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia intervened and were defeated by Israel. About 800,000 Palestinians fled from areas annexed by Israel and became [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]] in neighbouring countries, thus creating the \"Palestinian problem\", which has troubled the region ever since. Approximately two-thirds of 758,000\u2013866,000 of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jews expelled or who fled from Arab lands]] after 1948 were absorbed and naturalized by the State of Israel.\n\nOn August 16, 1960, [[Cyprus]] gained its independence from the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]].

Iran in particular became a key U.S. ally, until a revolution led by the [[Shi'a]] clergy [[Iranian revolution|overthrew the monarchy in 1979]] and established a [[theocracy|theocratic]] regime that was even more anti-western than the secular regimes in Iraq or Syria. This forced the United States into a close alliance with Saudi Arabia. The list of Arab-Israeli wars includes a great number of major wars such as [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], [[1956 Suez War]], 1967 [[Six-Day War]], 1970 [[War of Attrition]], 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], [[1982 Lebanon War]], as well as a number of lesser conflicts.\n\n[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] concluded a peace treaty in 1978.]]\nIn [[Cyprus]] between 1955 and 1974, conflict arising between [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]] led to [[Cypriot intercommunal violence]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. The [[Cyprus dispute]] remains unresolved.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1960s, the [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] led by [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Din al-Bitar]] took power in both Iraq and Syria. Iraq was first ruled by [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], but was succeeded by [[Saddam Hussein]] in 1979, and Syria was ruled first by a Military Committee led by [[Salah Jadid]], and later [[Hafez al-Assad]] until 2000, when he was succeeded by his son, [[Bashar al-Assad]].\n\nIn 1979, Egypt under Nasser's successor, [[Anwar Sadat]], concluded a peace treaty with Israel, ending the prospects of a united Arab military front. From the 1970s the Palestinians, led by [[Yasser Arafat]]'s [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], resorted to a prolonged campaign of violence against Israel and against American, Jewish, and western targets generally, as a means of weakening Israeli resolve and undermining western support for Israel. The Palestinians were supported in this, to varying degrees, by the regimes in Syria, Libya, Iran, and Iraq. The high point of this campaign came in the 1975 [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] condemning Zionism as a form of racism and the reception given to Arafat by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 4686]].\n\nDue to many of the frantic events of the late 1970s in the Middle East it culminated in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] between neighbouring Iran and Iraq. The war, started by Iraq, who invaded Iranian [[Khuzestan]] in 1980 at the behest of the latter's chaotic state of country due to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, eventually turned into a stalemate with hundreds of thousands of dead on both sides.\n\nThe fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the collapse of [[communism]] in the early 1990s had several consequences for the Middle East. It allowed large numbers of [[Soviet Jews]] to emigrate from [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] to Israel, further strengthening the Jewish state. It cut off the easiest source of credit, armaments, and diplomatic support to the anti-western Arab regimes, weakening their position. It opened up the prospect of cheap oil from Russia, driving down the price of oil and reducing the west's dependence on oil from the Arab states. It discredited the model of development through authoritarian state socialism, which Egypt (under Nasser), Algeria, Syria, and Iraq had followed since the 1960s, leaving these regimes politically and economically stranded. Rulers such as Iraq's Saddam Hussein increasingly relied on [[Arab nationalism]] as a substitute for socialism.\n\nSaddam Hussein led Iraq into a prolonged and [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|costly war with Iran]] from 1980 to 1988, and then into its fateful invasion of [[Kuwait]] in 1990. Kuwait had been part of the Ottoman province of [[Basra]] before 1918, and thus in a sense part of Iraq, even though Iraq had recognized its [[History of Kuwait#Golden Era (1946\u20131982)|independence in 1961]]. In response, the United States formed a coalition of allies with Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria, gained [[United Nations|UN]] approval, and evicted Iraq from Kuwait by force in the [[Gulf War]]. President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.&nbsp;W. Bush]] did not, however, attempt to overthrow Saddam Hussein, which the United States later came to regret.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Gulf War led to a permanent U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, particularly in Saudi Arabia, which offended many Muslims, and was a reason often cited by [[Osama bin Laden]] as justification for the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n===1990s\u2013present===\n[[File:MiddleEast.png|thumb|400px|A map of the Middle East (2003)]]\n\nThe worldwide change of governance in Eastern Europe, Latin America, East Asia, and parts of Africa following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] did not occur in the Middle East. In the whole region, only Israel, Turkey and to some extent Lebanon and the Palestinian territories were considered to be democracies. Some countries had legislative bodies, but these were said to have little power. In the [[Persian Gulf states]] the majority of the population could not vote because they were guest workers rather than citizens.\n\nIn most Middle Eastern countries, the growth of market economies was said to be limited by political restrictions, corruption, and [[cronyism]], overspending on arms and prestige projects and over-dependence on oil revenues. The successful economies were countries that had oil wealth and low populations, such as [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], where the ruling emirs allowed some political and social liberalization, but without giving up any of their own power. Lebanon also rebuilt a fairly successful economy after a prolonged [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] in the 1980s.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, all these factors intensified conflict in the Middle East, which affected the entire world. [[Bill Clinton]]'s failed attempt to broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine at the [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David Summit]] in 2000 led directly to the election of [[Ariel Sharon]] as Prime Minister of Israel and to the [[Second Intifada]], which conducted [[suicide bombing]]s on Israeli civilians. This was the first major outbreak of violence since the [[Oslo Peace Accords]] of 1993.\n\nAt the same time, the failures of most of the Arab governments and the bankruptcy of secular Arab radicalism led a section of educated Arabs (and other Muslims) to embrace [[Islamism]], promoted both by Iran's [[Shi'a]] clerics as well as by Saudi Arabia's powerful [[Wahhabist]] sect. Many of the militant Islamists gained their military training while [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|fighting Soviet forces]] in [[Afghanistan]].{{dubious|date=July 2015}} Many of the [[Mujahideen|Afghan jihadists]], though supposedly none of the Arab volunteers, were funded by the United States under [[Operation Cyclone]] as part of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], one of the longest and most expensive [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[covert operations]] ever.<ref name=bergen68>Bergen, Peter, ''Holy War Inc.'', Free Press, (2001), p. 68</ref><ref name=\"Oily\">{{cite news |title=The Oily Americans |date=13 May 2003 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,450997-92,00.html |work=Time |accessdate=2008-07-08 |first1=Donald L. |last1=Barlett |first2=James B. |last2=Steele}}</ref>\n\nOne of these Arab militants was a wealthy Saudi Arabian named [[Osama bin Laden]]. After fighting against the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviets in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, he formed the [[al-Qaida]] organization, which was responsible for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]] and the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The September 11 attacks led the [[George W. Bush]] administration to [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invade Afghanistan]] in 2001 to overthrow the [[Taliban]] regime, which had been harbouring Bin Laden and al-Qaida. The United States and its allies described this operation as part of a global \"[[War on Terror]]\".\n\nIn 2002, U.S. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] developed a plan to invade Iraq, remove Saddam from power, and turn Iraq into a democratic state with a free-market economy, which they hoped would serve as a model for the rest of the Middle East. The United States and its principal allies\u2014Britain, Italy, Spain, and Australia\u2014could not secure [[United Nations]] approval for the execution of the numerous UN resolutions, so they launched an invasion of Iraq and deposed Saddam without much difficulty in April 2003.\n\nThe advent of a new western army of occupation in a Middle Eastern capital marked a turning point in the history of the region. Despite successful elections (although boycotted by large portions of Iraq's Sunni population) held in January 2005, much of Iraq had all but disintegrated, due to a post-war insurgency which morphed into persistent ethnic violence that the American army was initially unable to quell. Many of Iraq's intellectual and business elite fled the country, and many Iraqi refugees left as a result of the insurgency, further destabilizing the region. A responsive surge in U.S. forces in Iraq was largely successful in controlling the insurgency and stabilizing the country. U.S. forces [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|withdrew]] from Iraq by December 2011.\n\nBy 2005, President George W. Bush's [[Road map for peace]] between Israel and the Palestinians was stalled, although this situation had begun to change with [[Yasser Arafat]]'s death in 2004. In response, Israel moved towards a unilateral solution, pushing ahead with the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] to protect Israel from Palestinian suicide bombers and proposed unilateral withdrawal from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. The barrier if completed would amount to a ''de facto'' annexation of areas of the [[West Bank]] by Israel. In 2006 a new conflict erupted between Israel and [[Hezbollah]] Shi'a militia in southern Lebanon, further setting back any \"prospects for peace\".\n\nIn the early 2010s, a [[revolutionary wave]] popularly known as the [[Arab Spring]] brought major protests, uprisings, and revolutions to several Middle Eastern countries, followed by prolonged civil wars in [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|Iraq]], [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]], and [[Libyan Civil War (2011\u2013present)|Libya]]. In 2014, a terrorist group and self-proclaimed caliphate calling itself the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] made rapid territorial gains in western Iraq and eastern Syria, prompting [[International military intervention against ISIL|international military intervention]]. At its peak, the group controlled an area containing an estimated 2.8 to 8 million people, 98% of which was lost by December 2017.\n\n== Maps of the Middle East from 1910 to 2010 ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1910.png|The Middle East in 1910 <br /> (Before [[ww1]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1920.png|1920 <br /> (After [[ww1]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1930.png|1930 <br /> (Before [[ww2]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1940.png|1940 <br /> (During [[ww2]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1950.png|1950 <br /> (After [[ww2]])\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1960.png|1960\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1970.png|1970\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1980.png|1980\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_1990.png|1990\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_2000.png|2000\nFile:The_Middle_East_in_2010.png|2010\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of history journals#Middle East]]\n* [[Middle Eastern Empires]]\n* [[Timeline of Middle Eastern history]]\n* The [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises]]\n* [[British foreign policy in the Middle East]]\n* [[United States foreign policy in the Middle East]]\n'''By country:'''\n* [[History of Armenia]]\n* [[History of Azerbaijan]]\n* [[History of Bahrain]]\n* [[History of Egypt]]\n* [[History of Georgia (country)|History of Georgia]]\n* [[History of Iran]]\n* [[History of Iraq]]\n* [[History of Israel]]\n* [[History of Jordan]]\n* [[History of Kuwait]]\n* [[History of Lebanon]]\n* [[History of Oman]]\n* [[History of Palestine]]\n* [[History of Qatar]]\n* [[History of Saudi Arabia]]\n* [[History of Syria]]\n* [[History of Turkey]]\n* [[History of the United Arab Emirates]]\n* [[History of Yemen]]\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[History of North Africa]]\n* [[History of Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Works cited'''\n* {{citation|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=The Oxford History of Islam|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-19-510799-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imw_KFD5bsQC&pg=PR7|edition=Illustrated|authorlink=John Esposito}}\n* {{citation|last=Guzman|first=Gregory|title=Christian Europe and Mongol Asia: First Medieval Intercultural Contact Between East and West|journal=Essays in Medieval Studies|year=1985|volume=2|url=http://www.illinoismedieval.org/EMS/EMSpdf/V2/V2Guzman.pdf}}\n* {{citation|last=Hourani|first=Albert|title=A History of the Arab Peoples|year=2013|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=978-0-571-30249-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irtb55WDsjMC|edition=Updated|authorlink=Albert Hourani}}\n* {{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|year=2007|title=A Brief History of the World|publisher=[[The Teaching Company]]|authorlink=Peter Stearns}}\n* {{citation|last=Wawro|first=Geoffrey|title=Historical Atlas: A Comprehensive History of the World|year=2008|publisher=Millennium House|location=Elanora Heights, NSW, Australia|isbn=978-1-921209-23-9|authorlink=Geoffrey Wawro}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Cheta, Omar Youssef. \"The economy by other means: The historiography of capitalism in the modern Middle East.\" ''History Compass'' (April 2018) 16#4 DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12444\n* Cleveland, William L. and Martin Bunton.

Events usually take place in a carnival-like format with many booths from different companies, performers from various [[list of disability organisations in Singapore|disability organisations in Singapore]], as well as the marching of contingents.\n\nThe event has been held each year in Singapore from 2013 to 2015 at [[Speakers Corner]] in [[Hong Lim Park]], as well as the [[Fountain of Wealth]] in [[Suntec City]] since 2016 on a Saturday in October or November. The 2019 event was held on 2 November.\n\n==History==\nThe Purple Parade was first conceived as an event for the inclusion of people with special needs back in 2013, with 40 organisations and the [[Central Singapore Community Development Council]] coming together to commemorate the [[International Day of Persons with Disabilities]], which falls on 3 December every year. In previous years, various organisations celebrated that in small groups, rendering the approach ineffective and without impact. In order to promote the event, a social media movement led by [[Denise Phua]], along with several [[list of members of the 12th Parliament of Singapore|parliamentarians]] (including [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and then Acting [[Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth|Minister for Culture, Community and Youth]] [[Lawrence Wong]]) was started to get support for the event.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kok |first1=Xing Hui |title=40 organisations band together for disabled people |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/40-organisations-band-together-disabled-people |website=Today |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kok |first1=Xing Hui |title=Purple Parade publicises through social media |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/purple-parade-publicises-through-social-media |website=Today |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=29 November 2013}}</ref> The first event was eventually held on 30 November 2013.<ref name=\"PP2013\">{{cite web |last1=Sim |first1=Royston |title=Over 4,000 turn up at event to raise awareness about special needs community |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-4000-turn-up-at-event-to-raise-awareness-about-special-needs-community |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=1 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe colour purple symbolises royalty, with the square logo representing a call for equality for those with special needs in all areas of society.<ref name=\"PP2013\"/>\n\nSince then, a total of seven Purple Parade events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in October or November.\n\n==Events==\nEach event took place on a Saturday.

Events usually take place in a carnival-like format with many booths from different companies, performers from various [[list of disability organisations in Singapore|disability organisations in Singapore]], as well as the marching of contingents.\n\nThe event has been held each year in Singapore from 2013 to 2015 at [[Speakers Corner]] in [[Hong Lim Park]], as well as the [[Fountain of Wealth]] in [[Suntec City]] on a Saturday in October or November. The 2019 event was held on 2 November.\n\n==History==\nThe Purple Parade was first conceived as an event for the inclusion of people with special needs back in 2013, with 40 organisations and the [[Central Singapore Community Development Council]] coming together to commemorate the [[International Day of Persons with Disabilities]], which falls on 3 December every year. In previous years, various organisations celebrated that in small groups, rendering the approach ineffective and without impact. In order to promote the event, a social media movement led by [[Denise Phua]], along with several [[list of members of the 12th Parliament of Singapore|parliamentarians]] (including [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and then Acting [[Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth|Minister for Culture, Community and Youth]] [[Lawrence Wong]]) was started to get support for the event.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kok |first1=Xing Hui |title=40 organisations band together for disabled people |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/40-organisations-band-together-disabled-people |website=Today |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kok |first1=Xing Hui |title=Purple Parade publicises through social media |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/purple-parade-publicises-through-social-media |website=Today |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=29 November 2013}}</ref> The first event was eventually held on 30 November 2013.<ref name=\"PP2013\">{{cite web |last1=Sim |first1=Royston |title=Over 4,000 turn up at event to raise awareness about special needs community |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/over-4000-turn-up-at-event-to-raise-awareness-about-special-needs-community |website=The Straits Times |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=1 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe colour purple symbolises royalty, with the square logo representing a call for equality for those with special needs in all areas of society.<ref name=\"PP2013\"/>\n\nSince then, a total of seven Purple Parade events have been held in Singapore, occurring annually on Saturdays in October or November.\n\n==Events==\nEach event took place on a Saturday.
