Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"columns\". While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it. After a column lands, if three or more of the same symbols are connected in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this resettlement causes three or more other symbols to align, they too disappear and the cycle repeats. Occasionally, a special column with a multicolor Magic Jewel appears. It destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it. The columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with jewels, which ends the game. Players can score up to 99,999,999 points.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-points-total-on-columns-(mega-drive-version)/|title=Highest points total on Columns (Mega Drive version)|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>\n\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Ports, sequels, and clones==\n''Columns'' was the first [[pack-in game]] for the [[Sega Game Gear]]. This version was slightly different from the [[Sega Genesis]] version and its soundtrack was transposed and rearranged due to the limitations of the handheld's sound chip. While the columns themselves were updated for the Genesis version, the overall decoration was less like a cartoon in the Game Gear version and instead more artistically designed. Lastly, the Game Gear version had a feature that let the player change the jewels to fruit, squares, dice, or card shapes (clubs, diamonds, spades).\n\nMany [[sequel]]s and spin-offs were produced: ''[[Columns II|Columns II: The Voyage Through Time]]'', ''[[Columns III|Columns III: Revenge of Columns]]'', ''[[Columns '97]]'', ''[[Sakura Taisen: Hanagumi Taisen Columns]] 1 & 2'', and many compilations and re-releases (''Columns Arcade Collection'', ''[[Sega Ages#Sega Ages (Sega Saturn)|Sega Ages Vol. 07: Columns]]'') as well.

Initially, mail services were handled by the military authorities and then by the Master Attendant in 1823.  The volume of mail was very small in those days and letters were collected and delivered from a single mail office.  The Post Office, as it was then known, shared a room with the Master Attendant's Marine Office and the clerk to the Registrar of Import and Export.  The whole establishment of the post office in the 1830s consisted of one European clerk, one local writer and a peon.\n\nTo cope with the increasing volume of mail, the Post Office, then known as the Singapore Post Office, later General Post Office, was moved in 1854 to its own building near the Town Hall by the side of the Singapore River.  Although it was more spacious, there were frequent complaints regarding its location.  The Commercial Square (business sector) was on the opposite side of the river, so going to the Post office was inconvenient as one had to cross the river by boat. After 1856, a footbridge was constructed across the river and a toll of {{frac|1|4}} cent was levied.\n\nAs trade flourished in Singapore and both postal and marine traffic grew heavier, the Post Office was separated from the Marine Office and it became a separate department in October 1858.  During the period 1819 and 1858, letters for posting had to be handed in at the Post Office.  No postage stamps were used but a register was kept of all letters received at the Post Office and of the names of sailing ships on which they were conveyed.\n\nStamped receipts were also given for all letters sent to the Post Office for dispatch.  For the convenience of the residents, a register was kept of their individual postage accounts on the understanding that all postage due would be regularly settled every month.  The first postage stamps were introduced for payment of postage only in 1854.  In the early days, the flagstaff at Government Hill (now Fort Canning) was eagerly watched as flying of a flag at daylight, or the firing of a gun at night, signified the arrival of a ship with mail.  This infused new life into the quiet community.\n\nOn receipt of letters from incoming ships, the Post Office sorters would proceed to register alphabetically all the letters before sending them out through the postmen for delivery.  Postal delivery services by means of bullock cart, horse carriage or on foot, were first restricted to the town area.  Posting boxes were later installed in the town area for the posting of mail which were then collected by horse-drawn mail coaches.\n\nIn 1873, a new General Post office was built on the site of the former Fort Fullerton, a location which was much nearer to the commercial centre of the town.  However, the British Government failed to foresee the needs of the future, with the result that the building had to be replaced by another on practically the same site.  The new General Post Office was completed in 1885, three years after approval was obtained.\n\nThe General Post Office was closed on 23 April 1921.  All the equipment were moved to a building on the recently reclaimed land at Collyer Quay, and staff worked at this temporary post office during the construction of Fullerton Building.  The post office was transferred back to Fullerton Building on 23 July 1928 and has remained there since.\n\nThe latter part of the 19th century marked the modern phase of the development in the history of the Singapore postal service.  Services were extended to include a parcel post service, money order and postal order services and a post office savings bank.  1897 saw the establishment of the first sub-post offices, and by 1938, some 20 sub-post offices were already providing decentralised postal facilities on the island.  The horse-drawn mail coaches were withdrawn and replaced by motor vans in 1914 as the mail traffic handled steadily increased.\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1982, the Postal Services Department merged with the then ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'', also known as Telecoms.\n\nIn 1992, the ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'' was split into three entities:\n# The reconstituted Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS, now part of the [[Infocomm Media Development Authority]] (IMDA))\n# Singapore Telecommunications Limited (now [[Singtel]]) and\n# Singapore Post Private Limited, an associated company of Singapore Telecommunications (as of Jun 2012).\n\nSingapore Post Limited was listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (SGX-ST) on 13 May 2003.\n<!--The company was incorporated on [[28 March 1992]], and listed on 13 May 2003-->\nSingapore Post is the first Public Postal Licensee. TAS granted the licence in 1992 in accordance with section 42 of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Act 1992. As a licensee, Singapore Post is empowered to operate postal services with the exclusive privilege of receiving, collecting and delivering letters and postcards from one place to another until 31 March 2007.\n\nSingPost was fined S$100,000 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-100000-for-failing-to-meet-local-mail-delivery-standards-in-2017|title=SingPost fined $100k for failing to meet local mail delivery standards in 2017|date=7 February 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> and S$300,000 in 2018<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-record-300000-for-failing-to-meet-2018-service-standards|title=SingPost fined record $300,000 for failing to meet service standards in 2018|date=29 March 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> for failing to meet mail delivery standards by IMDA.\n\n==Growth==\nSingPost has made several acquisitions to strengthen and grow its business. In 2009, it acquired the remaining 50% stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac (G3AP),<ref>{{cite web|title=SingPost acquires stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac|url=http://postandparcel.info/23900/news/singpost-acquires-stake-in-g3-worldwide-aspac/}}</ref> thereby giving the company presence in 10 countries (including Singapore).

After 1856, a footbridge was constructed across the river and a toll of {{frac|1|4}} cent was levied.\n\nAs trade flourished in Singapore and both postal and marine traffic grew heavier, the Post Office was separated from the Marine Office and it became a separate department in October 1858.  During the period 1819 and 1858, letters for posting had to be handed in at the Post Office.  No postage stamps were used but a register was kept of all letters received at the Post Office and of the names of sailing ships on which they were conveyed.\n\nStamped receipts were also given for all letters sent to the Post Office for dispatch.  For the convenience of the residents, a register was kept of their individual postage accounts on the understanding that all postage due would be regularly settled every month.  The first postage stamps were introduced for payment of postage only in 1854.  In the early days, the flagstaff at Government Hill (now Fort Canning) was eagerly watched as flying of a flag at daylight, or the firing of a gun at night, signified the arrival of a ship with mail.  This infused new life into the quiet community.\n\nOn receipt of letters from incoming ships, the Post Office sorters would proceed to register alphabetically all the letters before sending them out through the postmen for delivery.  Postal delivery services by means of bullock cart, horse carriage or on foot, were first restricted to the town area.  Posting boxes were later installed in the town area for the posting of mail which were then collected by horse-drawn mail coaches.\n\nIn 1873, a new General Post office was built on the site of the former Fort Fullerton, a location which was much nearer to the commercial centre of the town.  However, the British Government failed to foresee the needs of the future, with the result that the building had to be replaced by another on practically the same site.  The new General Post Office was completed in 1885, three years after approval was obtained.\n\nThe General Post Office was closed on 23 April 1921.  All the equipment were moved to a building on the recently reclaimed land at Collyer Quay, and staff worked at this temporary post office during the construction of Fullerton Building.  The post office was transferred back to Fullerton Building on 23 July 1928 and has remained there since.\n\nThe latter part of the 19th century marked the modern phase of the development in the history of the Singapore postal service.  Services were extended to include a parcel post service, money order and postal order services and a post office savings bank.  1897 saw the establishment of the first sub-post offices, and by 1938, some 20 sub-post offices were already providing decentralised postal facilities on the island.  The horse-drawn mail coaches were withdrawn and replaced by motor vans in 1914 as the mail traffic handled steadily increased.\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1982, the Postal Services Department merged with the then ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'', also known as Telecoms.\n\nIn 1992, the ''Telecommunication Authority of Singapore'' was split into three entities:\n# The reconstituted Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS, now part of the [[Infocomm Media Development Authority]] (IMDA))\n# Singapore Telecommunications Limited (now [[Singtel]]) and\n# Singapore Post Private Limited, an associated company of Singapore Telecommunications (as of Jun 2012).\n\nSingapore Post Limited was listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (SGX-ST) on 13 May 2003.\n<!--The company was incorporated on [[28 March 1992]], and listed on 13 May 2003-->\nSingapore Post is the first Public Postal Licensee. TAS granted the licence in 1992 in accordance with section 42 of the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore Act 1992. As a licensee, Singapore Post is empowered to operate postal services with the exclusive privilege of receiving, collecting and delivering letters and postcards from one place to another until 31 March 2007.\n\nSingPost was fined S$100,000 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-100000-for-failing-to-meet-local-mail-delivery-standards-in-2017|title=SingPost fined $100k for failing to meet local mail delivery standards in 2017|date=7 February 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> and S$300,000 in 2018<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Tiffany Fumiko|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singpost-fined-record-300000-for-failing-to-meet-2018-service-standards|title=SingPost fined record $300,000 for failing to meet service standards in 2018|date=29 March 2019|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> for failing to meet mail delivery standards by IMDA.\n\n==Growth==\nSingPost has made several acquisitions to strengthen and grow its business. In 2009, it acquired the remaining 50% stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac (G3AP),<ref>{{cite web|title=SingPost acquires stake in G3 Worldwide Aspac|url=http://postandparcel.info/23900/news/singpost-acquires-stake-in-g3-worldwide-aspac/}}</ref> thereby giving the company presence in 10 countries (including Singapore).

Both parties also signed an agreement to pursue a joint venture in the business of e-commerce logistics.\n\nIn October 2015, SingPost acquired a 96.3 per cent stake in TradeGlobal for US$168.6 million (S$230 million), thereby expanding its e-commerce footprint in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singpost-acquires-us-e/2193930.html|title=SingPost acquires US e-commerce provider TradeGlobal for S$236m|accessdate=22 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041444/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singpost-acquires-us-e/2193930.html|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=dead|publisher=Channel NewsAsia}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Postage stamps and postal history of Singapore]]\n*[[Postal codes in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.singpost.com/ Singapore Post Limited official website]\n*[http://quantiumsolutions.com/ Quantium Solutions official website]\n*[http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-its-the-postman Singapore Drone Mail Delivery Trial]\n{{Postal administrations of Asia}}\n\n[[Category:Postal organizations]]\n[[Category:Logistics companies of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Postal system of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1819]]\n[[Category:Singaporean brands]]\n[[Category:Philately of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Government-owned companies of Singapore]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Singapore Exchange]]\n", "name_user": "Lise Hereford", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Post"}

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]].

''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (\u00a312,930 per annum in 2019/20). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J.

In accordance with its founder's wishes, MGS has remained a predominantly academic school and belongs to the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].\n\nIn the post-war period, MGS was a [[direct-grant grammar school]]. It chose to become an independent school in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] abolished the Direct Grant System.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1978/mar/22/direct-grant-schools | house=House of Commons | date=22 March 1978 |title=Direct Grant Schools |speaker=Miss Margaret Jackson |position=[[Under-Secretary of State]] | column_start=582W | column_end=586W }}</ref>  Fees for 2016\u20132017 were \u00a311,970 per annum.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance |title=Fees and Assistance |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Motto, coat of arms and school badges==\n[[File:Sapere avde.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sapere Aude]], the Manchester Grammar School school motto]]\n\nThe school's [[motto]] is ''[[wikt:sapere aude|Sapere Aude]]'' (\"Dare to be Wise\"), which was also the motto of the [[County Borough Council|council]] of the former [[County Borough of Oldham]] (now, with the same coat of arms, the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]]),<ref name=\"Bentley\"/> granted on 7 November 1894. ''Sapere aude'' is a quotation from [[Horace]], famously used by [[Immanuel Kant]] and also the motto of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"COA\">{{cite web|title=The Coat of Arms|url=https://www.mgsarchives.org/the-coat-of-arms|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Senior School badge is an outline of an owl, carrying a banner with the word \"dom\" on it. This is a [[Canting arms|heraldic \"canting\"]] reference to its founder, Hugh Oldham, and the badge should be read as \"owl-dom\". This suggests that he pronounced his name, as the local accent in Oldham still tends to do, as \"Ow[l]dem\". Owls are also to be seen in the shield of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Borough of Oldham]].<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\nThere is possibly a second significance to the \"dom\" of which Hugh Oldham, as a bishop, would have been very well aware. D.O.M. was and is a standard abbreviation for ''Deo Optimo Maximo'' meaning \"To God, the Best and the Greatest\", a phrase of dedication often required to be written by schoolboys before the Reformation and in Roman Catholic education since, at the head of a new piece of work, a practice continued into adult life by many as they committed a new undertaking into God's hands. This badge replaced the original one when the school colours changed from red, black and yellow to dark and light blue to reflect its connection with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe Junior School badge, which depicts the face of an owl, was introduced to blazers and ties in 2008.<ref name=\"COA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n[[Image:HrXhrm6hrs580h9.JPG|upright|right|thumb|A drawing of the Chetham's Gatehouse circa 1600.]]\nThe founder, Hugh Oldham, a Manchester-born man, attended [[Exeter College, Oxford]] and [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], after having been tutored in the house of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]. Historical accounts suggest that he was not a particularly learned man, but was in Royal service, being a favoured prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]], mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and became recognised for his administrative abilities. He was appointed [[Bishop of Exeter]] in 1505. His great wealth came from his water-powered corn mills on the [[River Irk]] near Manchester, which were subsequently used to fund the school's endowment.\n\nOn 2 July 1515 he signed an endowment trust deed establishing the Manchester Free Grammar School for Lancashire Boys. A site was purchased in September 1516 and construction took place between April 1517 and August 1518. The combined cost was \u00a3218.13s.5d, largely given by Oldham, but with the help of his and the Bexwyke (Beswick) family who had provided an earlier endowment for a school within the parish church. A more elaborate deed in 1525 set the detailed rules for the school until the late 19th century.\n\nThe original deed promoted \"Godliness and good learning\" and established that any boy showing sufficient academic ability, regardless of background, might attend, free of charge. The school was situated between [[Manchester Cathedral]], then a collegiate church, and the church's domestic quarters, subsequently [[Chetham's School of Music]].\n\nLater, Oldham's great friend [[Richard Foxe]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], wished to found a monastery. Oldham, however, convinced him instead to found [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] in Oxford and contributed 6000 marks. Oldham also had a hand in the founding of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].\n\n===Early history===\nThe original foundation provided a school house in the curtilage of Manchester's Parish Church and two graduates (the 'High Master' and the 'Usher') to teach Latin and later Greek, to any children who presented themselves. The school was intended to prepare pupils for university and eventually the Church or the legal profession. Typically, pupils would have stayed for 8 to 10 years before leaving for university. There was often enough money to fund bursaries or exhibitions for pupils.\n\nIn 1654, the world's first free public library was formed next door to MGS in what had been the church's living quarters. This was facilitated by a bequest from a wealthy businessman (and ex-pupil) [[Humphrey Chetham]], which also served to create a [[Charity school|bluecoat]] orphanage there, schooling 40 poor boys.\n\nBy the 18th century, there are thought to have been between 50 and 100 boys in the grammar school at any one time, three or four of whom each year were awarded exhibitions to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. An extra room had been built onto the school house for boys who needed instruction in English before they started [[Latin]], and another master was employed to teach them.\n\n[[File:Manchester Grammar School class in 1908.jpg|thumb|right|Classroom at the old site]]\nThe 1515 building was replaced on the same site in 1776. This was on two levels, an Upper School for the Latin and Greek pupils, a Lower School for the English pupils. Boarding-houses were added and many of the Upper School pupils were boarders from surrounding counties. When De Quincy came as a boarder in 1800, classes were held at roughly 7.00am to 9.00, 9.30 to 12.00 and 3.00pm to 5.00.<ref>Most of the material in the first part of this section is taken from ''The Manchester Grammar School 1515\u20131965'', edited by J A Graham and B A Phythian (both of whom were members of the school's teaching staff at the time), Manchester University Press, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1808 consideration was being given to moving from the site, as it was becoming insalubrious, but this proved impossible as the deed could not be changed except by Act of Parliament.\n\n<blockquote>\nGoing from the Old Church to Long Millgate&nbsp;... one is in an almost undisguised working men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness&nbsp;... [The Irk, immediately beside the school,] is a narrow, coal black, foul smelling stream full of debris and refuse.<ref>[[Engels]], quoted in ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Chethams manchester exterior.jpg|right|thumb|Manchester Grammar extension built in the 1870s (The old site)]]\nA commercial school, in parallel with the classical school, and more suited to Manchester's business climate, was established in the 1830s. By this time the school was getting richer on the proceeds of the mills which provided its funding and had a growing surplus on account. Its 'feoffees' (or governors) were mostly landed gentry from outside Manchester and they were heavily criticised for running the school to suit the needs of their offspring rather than as originally intended, the poor of Manchester. This led to a long running suit at the Court of Chancery, which eventually promoted the commercial side at the expense of the classical side of the school.\n\nThe area around the school continued to change. During the 1840s, [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria railway station]] was completed opposite the school and the church became [[Manchester Cathedral]]. Then, in the 1870s, a new building, the Manchester Grammar Extension, was built, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and including new classrooms, laboratories and a gymnasium, reflecting the wider curriculum that had developed since the 1830s. It was connected to the original by a first-storey bridge. It was said that the bridge's purpose was not for ease of movement between the parts of the school, but rather to dwarf Chetham's gatehouse both in terms of size and grandeur.\n\nThe tenure of [[Michael George Glazebrook]] as High Master, beginning in 1888, saw the introduction of three changes according to pupil [[Ernest Barker]]: a system of [[prefects#Academic|prefects]] to keep order, the singing of [[school song]]s conducted by [[John Farmer (1835-1901)|John Farmer]], and the wearing of school-caps and school-hats.<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1953) ''Age and Youth'', page 267, [[Oxford University Press]]</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nBy the early 20th century the school was increasingly receiving funding from the state. This was negligible in 1901, fees providing three quarters of the income, most of the remainder being from the foundation. But by 1931, state grants contributed nearly 30% of the total, and the number of pupils had increased to 1,100.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nIn 1930 the school moved out of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] to accommodate a growing pupil body and provide a wider range of facilities. The new location chosen was in [[Rusholme]], off Old Hall Lane, where the school still stands today.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nBoth of the school's earlier buildings lay empty, and while the former was destroyed in the [[Second World War]], the latter, renamed the Long Millgate Building, became a teacher training college in the 1950s. In 1969, [[Chetham's School of Music]] was founded and occupied what had been the orphanage. When the teacher training college closed in 1978, Chetham's took over the premises.<ref name=\"Bentley\" />\n\nAfter the [[Education Act 1944]], MGS became a [[direct grant grammar school]], which meant that the bulk of funding was provided by government. Entry was by merit (based on examination) and parents were means-tested and fees paid primarily by local education authorities on a sliding scale. Fees paid by parents amounted to less than 20% of the total income. It reverted to independent status in 1976 after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] \u2013 in the person of Education Secretary [[Shirley Williams]] \u2013 abolished the direct-grant funding system. Bursaries continue to support the merit based recruitment system, by abating fees for less well off pupils.<ref>Figures from ''MGS 1515\u20131965'' referenced above</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] was rescinded in the late 1990s, MGS was the first school to react with a seminal \"Bursary Appeal\", whose patron is [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]. The appeal has accumulated a value of over \u00a317.5m and finances bursaries, given to boys whose parents are unable to afford the school fees (\u00a312,930 per annum in 2019/20). Scholarships are not awarded.\n\nIn 2015 the school walked 500 miles to celebrate its 500 years anniversary. Boys and teachers were asked to raise money for the \"Bursary Appeal\" and walk a mile each. Over 240 pupils currently receive help from the fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fees and Assistance - The Manchester Grammar School|url = http://www.mgs.org/209/fees-and-assistance|website = www.mgs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref>\n<!-- (by which one quarter of the places were directly funded by central government with the rest attracting fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority, some by private pupils and a few funded by so-called Foundation Scholarships awarded on the basis of performance in the school entrance examinations).-->\n\n== Buildings ==\n=== Main building ===\n[[Image:MGS Main Building in Snow.jpg|right|thumb|MGS main building in 2007]]\nThe main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and [[Percy Worthington]]. In keeping with the style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock tower cupola. There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since become part of the Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir [[Nicholas Hytner]] (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought [[Alan Bennett]] and the actors from ''[[The History Boys]]'' to launch the campaign in 2006.\n\nThe main building also houses the Parker Art Hall which is a three-storey arts studio, situated in the south side of the main building. It is named after former High Master J.G. Parker. It includes a ceramics department with two kilns on the ground floor and also a dark room for photography.\n\nSince opening in 1931 the site at Fallowfield has seen many additions to the accommodation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Mason building ====\nThis is the school's language department, named after P.G. Mason, a former High Master, during whose tenure the building was erected. On the ground floor there are the Language Labs, two suites of listening stations, mainly used to practise the listening parts of national exams. This building was originally the school's Sixth Form block, and was built in 1966\u201367. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] on the occasion of her visit in 1965. By 1970 the shoddiness of the workmanship and materials used was revealed by the cracks which had already started appearing in the internal walls. It is joined to the main building on the ground floor by the Paton Library.\n\n==== Marks building ====\nNamed after former pupil [[Simon Marks]] son of Michael Marks, founder of the [[Marks & Spencer]] empire. It is just west of the main building, and was erected in 1958. Major extensions were made by addition of the first floor (after a gift of \u00a350,000 from Lord Marks) and the [[Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff|Israel Sieff]] Lecture Theatre (after a gift of \u00a35,000 from Lord Marks' brother-in-law), which were opened on 19 September 1962.<ref>Ulula Autumn 1962</ref> It currently hosts the following departments: Physics, General Science (taken by Year 7 and 8 pupils \u2013 before the subject splits into the usual three divisions), Geography, Computing and Mathematics. There are five physics laboratories, including one for radioactive experimentation, on the ground floor. The main computer room is situated on the first floor of the Marks building.\n\n====Theatres and drama  ====\nSieff Theatre is named after former pupil, [[Israel Sieff]], is situated at the end of the Marks Building and was refurbished in 2006; it is used for lectures and assemblies, as well as being the venue to Muslim Friday prayers.\n\n==== Sports hall and rectory building====\nThe Michael Atherton Sports Hall was opened by [[Mike Atherton]] (a former pupil) in 1997 and subsequently used by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in recording of a live CD. The sports hall was severely damaged in a gale in February 2014 and had to be demolished. There are also 2 squash courts adjacent to the sports hall. The former rectory of St James's Birch-in-Rusholme (the adjacent redundant church) it is located near the Sports Hall, and is the home of the Biology Department. However, only A-level biology is taught there. A new sports hall was opened in 2016.<ref name=\"new sports hall\">{{cite web|title=Ex-England cricket captain Mike Atherton returns to Manchester Grammar School to open new sports hall|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mike-atherton-cricket-manchester-grammar-10482508|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Music school ====\nLocated at the rear of the school, it is the building where the music department is based. There is a music library in the basement as well as a dozen or so music practice rooms, each having a piano, used for private lessons. It contains a keyboard suite allowing first and second years to learn basic keyboard playing and a hall on the west side used primarily for orchestra rehearsals. The original part of the building where the practice rooms are now located had been used in the 1950s and '60s as a bicycle shed.<ref>Len Brown, Old Mancunian, 1952\u201358</ref>\n\n=== Junior School buildings ===\n[[File:MGS Bexwyke Lodge.jpg|thumb|Bexwyke Lodge]]\nIn September 2008, MGS opened a Junior School for pupils in Years 5 and 6 and its doors open to Years 3 and 4 in September 2011; boys entering the Junior School do not sit an entrance exam but attend an assessment day and gain automatic admission into Year 7. The Junior School buildings are both state-of-the-art timber buildings, constructed from sustainable materials imported from [[Estonia]].\n\nJunior School pupils in Years 3, 4 and 5 are located in Plessyngton Lodge. Year 6 pupils work in Bexwyke Lodge, and 1 class of year 5 previously worked in Bexyke Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360&Itemid=320 |title=Bexwyke and Plessyngton Lodges |publisher=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328180304/http://mgs.org/the-mgs-junior-school/the-lodges |archivedate=28 March 2014 |title=The Lodges |work=The Manchester Grammar School |year=2015 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Outdoor Study and Pursuits Centres===\nThe school owns the '''Owls' Nest''', a large hut situated in [[Disley]], south of Manchester, near to [[Lyme Park]]. The original ex-Army hut was opened at Christmas 1920, but it was destroyed by a [[Manchester Blitz|German bomb on 23 December 1940]], and a replacement was provided in 1950.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121&Itemid=116 |title=Owls' Nest page |work=The Manchester Grammar School |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> The building is used by forms and activity groups of the school as a base for outdoor trips and camping expeditions. It is most frequently used by classes in Years 7 and 8, who spend a weekend there with their form teacher and form prefects. Wide games such as \"British Bulldog\" take place in the surrounding fields, and [[orienteering]] challenges in nearby Lyme Park. It is also used by school clubs such as the MGS Astronomical Society who use it for observational weekends because it is away from the lights of Manchester. The name refers to the school's logo of the owl.\n\nThere are four annual '''School Camps''', which have been in existence for many decades. They are held at [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], [[River Wye|Wye (Herefordshire)]], [[Bassenthwaite]] and [[Borrowdale]]. In Grasmere, the school has its own campsite donated by Old Mancunians in 1931. Visits to camps take part in the annual Activities Week, which is a week in which an impressive array of co-curricular activities are on offer to pupils.\n\nIn 2009 MGS opened the Old School House, its new outdoor study and pursuits centre in [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria. Set on a hillside with stunning views of the [[Vale of Eden]] and the [[Lake District]] [[fell]]s, the facility offers opportunities such as [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|D of E expeditions]], choral and concert practice, art workshops and courses on the Theory of Knowledge. The purchase of the Old School House was partially financed by Old Mancunian, John Young and his wife Elizabeth.\n\n==School organisation==\n===Academic life===\nThe school was among the first in the UK to adopt the International Mathematics GCSE.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Soon afterwards, MGS also adopted the three Sciences and today it offers the IGCSE in most subjects. The main difference between IGCSE and GCSE is that the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education|IGCSE]] does not have a compulsory coursework element, primarily because it would be too costly to moderate around the world. The maths and science departments decided that pupils were finding the coursework (which forms a fifth of the marks awarded in the national GCSE) undemanding and tedious and so made the switch in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4745367.stm|title=School drops 'tedious' maths GCSE|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2005}}</ref> In 2009 the GCSE was replaced by the IGCSE in most subjects (see below). At the same time the school began to offer additional GCSEs in Electronics and Mandarin Chinese, as well as Economics at A Level. \n\nSubjects available at GCSE/IGCSE are:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/175/academic-departments|title=Academic Departments - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n* Art and Design (GCSE)\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Classical Civilisation (GCSE)\n* Classical Greek (GCSE)\n* Computer Science\n* Drama (GCSE)\n* English Language\n* English Literature\n* Electronics (GCSE)\n* Geography\n* History\n* Latin (GCSE)\n* Mathematics & Further Mathematics (GCSE)\n* Modern Languages (French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian (GCSE), Mandarin Chinese (GCSE))\n* Music\n* Physics\n* Religious Studies\n\nAll the above subjects are available as Post-16 Qualifications (A-Level, International A-Level or Pre-U) as well as Politics and Economics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe school is known for its outstanding academic results. In 2017 91% of all A-Level grades were A*-B and at GCSE/IGCSE 68% of all grades were at the A* level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/177/results|title=Results - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Community Action===\nVolunteering or \"Community Action\" at the school is an important part of school life. Pupils visit many primary schools in less fortunate areas during their lunch breaks to help younger children to read. Every Christmas, presents donated by the local community are distributed by MGS pupils in [[City of Salford|Salford]] to families who would otherwise not be able to afford presents for their children. During sixth form options, some pupils hold a coffee morning at a residential care home for the elderly in Salford. Other activities include paired reading at primary schools, distribution of food at Harvest and gifts at Christmas in deprived areas of Salford, visiting the elderly, teaching English as an additional language, recycling schemes, gardening, working with specialist schools or volunteering at the [[Chinatown, Manchester|Manchester Chinese Centre]] and many more. Lots of MGS boys take part in the Millennium Volunteers V scheme (now 'Vinvolved') and receive certificates for logging their volunteering activities. There are plans for many more community action projects, including the launching of a new Community Action website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mgs.org/188/service|title=Service - The Manchester Grammar School|website=www.mgs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Partnerships with local schools===\nTwo girls' schools are situated nearby: [[Manchester High School for Girls]] and [[Withington Girls' School]]. MGS often collaborates with them particularly in music and drama events.\n\nIn 2013 the school founded in partnership with [[Manchester City Council]] and [[Urban Splash]], [[New Islington]] Free School.\n\n===Partnerships in Africa===\nMGS is also twinned with a school in [[Uganda]]. MGS became linked with the [[Busoga College|Busoga College Mwiri]] in 1990 as a consequence of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, Headmasters and Deputy Heads from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.\n\n==Publications==\nThere are three publications focusing on the school.\n\n'''''Ulula''''' is an annual full-colour magazine detailing life at MGS during the year. It contains a comprehensive review of activities of the societies, results achieved by the sports teams, dramatic and musical performances, as well as a selection of literary and fine art work made by the boys. It also serves to announce new appointments, retirements and departures of staff members. For those pupils who leave in the year prior to the issue of Ulula, the universities to which they are moving is listed.\n\n''''MGS News'''' is an annual 20-page glossy magazine published in October. It illustrates articles on the successes of MGS pupils, along with features on Old Mancunians and school events and activities. It is produced in-house by the Public Relations Department for promulgation to visitors at open events, current and prospective parents and teachers and the wider MGS community.\n\nThe '''''New Mancunian''''', is the school pupil newspaper which is written and produced by pupils and has won several national awards.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070504211734/http://www.mgs.org/view_page.asp?sel_sub_menu_id=526&sel_menu_id=152&section_id=4&page_id=852 MGS.org ]</ref> This is twinned in nomenclature with the '''''Old Mancunian''''' which is a monthly pamphlet sent out to ex-pupils.\n\nSpecialist publications are produced by societies, such as the Philsoc and Docsoc (science and medical societies respectively) magazines.\n\n==Old Mancunians \u2013 notable alumni==\n{{Main|List of Old Mancunians}}\n{{maincat|People educated at Manchester Grammar School}}\nThe school's alumni are called \"Old Mancunians\", or informally ''Old Mancs'', and include academics, politicians, mathematicians, sportsmen, such as former England cricket captain [[Mike Atherton]], former Lancashire Captain, [[Mark Chilton]], and former Lancashire and England batsman, [[John Crawley]], several notable writers, such as [[Thomas de Quincey]], playwright [[Robert Bolt]], author [[Alan Garner]], after whom the school's Junior Library is named, and journalist and broadcaster [[Martin Sixsmith]]. Other Old Mancunians are [[John Charles Polanyi]] (b. 1929) who won the 1986 [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry, actors [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Robert Powell]], historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], popular science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]], concert organist [[Daniel Moult]], comic [[Chris Addison]], and cryptographers [[Clifford Cocks]] and [[Malcolm J.

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nIn 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nThe [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801\u20131802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203\u2013208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military \"Julian Revolution\" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]].\n\n===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\n{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n\n====President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims====\nSince Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - Divisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Len\u00edn Moreno]], first lady [[Roc\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin.

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n* '''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]]. This land contains most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].\n* '''La Amazon\u00eda''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or \"the east\": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumb\u00edos Province|Sucumb\u00edos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n* '''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region.

It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Oso andino Porcon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ecuador is one of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world, it also has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation, and is one of the highest [[endemism]] worldwide.

Faced with the growth of the tourism sector, in June 1994, the decision was taken to separate tourism from information, so that it is exclusively dedicated to promoting and strengthening this activity.\n\nEcuador is a country with vast natural wealth. The diversity of its four regions has given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna. It has around 1640 kinds of birds. The species of butterflies border the 4,500, the reptiles 345, the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258, among others. Not in vain, Ecuador is considered one of the 17 countries where the planet's highest biodiversity is concentrated, being also the largest country with diversity per km2 in the world. Most of its fauna and flora lives in 26 protected areas by the State. Also, it has a huge culture spectrum. Since 2007, with the government of Rafael Correa, the tourism brand \"Ecuador Ama la Vida\" has been transformed, with which the nation's tourism promotion would be sold. Focused on considering it as a country friendly and respectful of the nature, natural biodiversity and cultural diversity of the peoples. And for this, means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy.\n\nThe country has two cities UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Quito and Cuenca, as well as two natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Galapagos Islands and Sangay National Park in addition to one [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve]], such as the Cajas massif. Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.\n\nAmong the main tourist destinations are:\n\n*Nature attractions: [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]].\n*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its Mama Negra festival.\n*Snowy mountains: [[Antisana]] volcano, [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] volcano, [[Chimborazo]] volcano, [[Cotopaxi]] volcano, [[Illiniza]]s volcanoes.\n*Beaches: [[Atacames]], [[Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez]], Crucita, [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]], [[Monta\u00f1ita]], [[Playas, Ecuador|Playas]], [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Quito Trole 06 2011 1933.jpg|thumb|The [[Trolleybuses in Quito|Troleb\u00fas]] bus rapid transit system that runs through [[Quito]].

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\n[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

However, as more and more North Americans are discovering Ecuador's potential, property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago, particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Ca\u00f1ari people 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ca\u00f1ari]] children with the typical Andean indigenous clothes]]\n\nEcuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and, like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Kichwa]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\n\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ceviche ecuador.JPG\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg\n| width2 = 154\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.\n}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad.

Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a \"m\u00e9dico\" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.\n\n[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]\n\nThis new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\n\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nIn 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nThe [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801\u20131802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203\u2013208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military \"Julian Revolution\" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]].\n\n===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\n{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n\n====President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims====\nSince Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - Divisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Len\u00edn Moreno]], first lady [[Roc\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.\n\nDue to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are Marshall Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and General [[Eloy Alfaro]].

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n* '''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]]. This land contains most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].\n* '''La Amazon\u00eda''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or \"the east\": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumb\u00edos Province|Sucumb\u00edos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n* '''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region.

It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Oso andino Porcon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ecuador is one of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world, it also has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation, and is one of the highest [[endemism]] worldwide.

Faced with the growth of the tourism sector, in June 1994, the decision was taken to separate tourism from information, so that it is exclusively dedicated to promoting and strengthening this activity.\n\nEcuador is a country with vast natural wealth. The diversity of its four regions has given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna. It has around 1640 kinds of birds. The species of butterflies border the 4,500, the reptiles 345, the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258, among others. Not in vain, Ecuador is considered one of the 17 countries where the planet's highest biodiversity is concentrated, being also the largest country with diversity per km2 in the world. Most of its fauna and flora lives in 26 protected areas by the State. Also, it has a huge culture spectrum. Since 2007, with the government of Rafael Correa, the tourism brand \"Ecuador Ama la Vida\" has been transformed, with which the nation's tourism promotion would be sold. Focused on considering it as a country friendly and respectful of the nature, natural biodiversity and cultural diversity of the peoples. And for this, means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy.\n\nThe country has two cities UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Quito and Cuenca, as well as two natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Galapagos Islands and Sangay National Park in addition to one [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve]], such as the Cajas massif. Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.\n\nAmong the main tourist destinations are:\n\n*Nature attractions: [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]].\n*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its Mama Negra festival.\n*Snowy mountains: [[Antisana]] volcano, [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] volcano, [[Chimborazo]] volcano, [[Cotopaxi]] volcano, [[Illiniza]]s volcanoes.\n*Beaches: [[Atacames]], [[Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez]], Crucita, [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]], [[Monta\u00f1ita]], [[Playas, Ecuador|Playas]], [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Quito Trole 06 2011 1933.jpg|thumb|The [[Trolleybuses in Quito|Troleb\u00fas]] bus rapid transit system that runs through [[Quito]].

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\n[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

However, as more and more North Americans are discovering Ecuador's potential, property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago, particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Ca\u00f1ari people 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ca\u00f1ari]] children with the typical Andean indigenous clothes]]\n\nEcuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and, like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Kichwa]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\n\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ceviche ecuador.JPG\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg\n| width2 = 154\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.\n}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad.

Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a \"m\u00e9dico\" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.\n\n[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]\n\nThis new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\n\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.
