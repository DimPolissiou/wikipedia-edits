Maude]] and Niel Gunson had both assumed it to be the very whaler ''Mary,'' as owned by a John Lydekker (1778\u20131832) and that her captain, a Edward Reed Lacy, had named the island. The one entry for August 5, 1824, of that ''Mary's'' logbook, however, makes no mention of a discovery or a vessel ''Ph\u0153nix''. The ''Mary'' that was truly there that day (her captain was presumably Abijah Lock) happened to be also a whaler from London yet was actually owned by ''Hill, Boulcott & Hill'', a firm consisting of the two brothers James & Amon Hill and their brother-in-law [[John Ellerker Boulcott]]. The latter was married to a Mary Boulcott, n\u00e9e Hill, and it was she whom this island was named for, but because it wasn't correctly penned down as \"Mary Boulcott's Island\" by William Dalton from the get-go that day, it was thenceforth predominately depicted in both deviated and abbreviated spelling-viarants. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LraODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=the+armchair+navigator&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuj6WOhsLkAhWNa1AKHSxFBeEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=THE ARMCHAIR NAVIGATOR I: Supplements to Post-Spanish Discoveries in The Pacific|last=Dehner|first=Steve|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dalton|first=William|title=The Dalton Journal.

During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments.

Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities.

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J.

This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes.

That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty.

Maude]] and Niel Gunson had both assumed it to be the very whaler ''Mary,'' as owned by a John Lydekker (1778\u20131832) and that her captain, a Edward Reed Lacy, had named the island. The one entry for August 5, 1824, of that ''Mary's'' logbook, however, makes no mention of a discovery or a vessel ''Ph\u0153nix''. The ''Mary'' that was truly there that day (her captain was presumably Abijah Lock) happened to be also a whaler from London yet was actually owned by ''Hill, Boulcott & Hill'', a firm consisting of the two brothers James & Amon Hill and their brother-in-law [[John Ellerker Boulcott]]. The latter was married to a Mary Boulcott, n\u00e9e Hill, and it was she whom this island was named for, but because it wasn't correctly penned down as \"Mary Boulcott's Island\" by William Dalton from the get-go, it was thenceforth predominately depicted in both deviated and abbreviated spelling-viarants. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LraODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=the+armchair+navigator&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjuj6WOhsLkAhWNa1AKHSxFBeEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=THE ARMCHAIR NAVIGATOR I: Supplements to Post-Spanish Discoveries in The Pacific|last=Dehner|first=Steve|publisher=|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dalton|first=William|title=The Dalton Journal.

During this time, the American party claimed the island for the United States, erecting a small monument with two American flags. According to one account, the British warship [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HMS ''Wellington'']] fired a shot across the bow of the [[USS Avocet (AVP-4)|USS ''Avocet'']], when the latter refused to cede the choicest anchorage spot to the British vessel.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> The American ship allegedly responded in kind, following which both captains agreed to \"cease fire\" until instructions could be received from their respective governments.

Although the British ambassador to the United States requested removal of markers claiming U.S. sovereignty, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] formally placed the island under control of the U.S. Interior department on 3&nbsp;March 1938. Both parties continued to press their competing claims until 6&nbsp;April 1939, when the U.S. and Britain agreed to hold Kanton under joint control for the next fifty years as the [[Canton and Enderbury Islands]] [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. The U.S./U.K. tenure proved cordial and cooperative thereafter, with each party enjoying the other's hospitality and working together to ensure smooth operation of island facilities.

[[British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines]] (BCPA), Australia's first trans-Pacific airline, served the island via a cooperative agreement with [[Australian National Airways]] (ANA) initially with Douglas DC-4's on a routing of Sydney - Auckland - Fiji - Kanton Island - Honolulu - San Francisco - Vancouver, with the inaugural flight departing Australia on 15&nbsp;September 1946.  BCPA then began flying luxurious [[Douglas DC-6B]]s on the Sydney to Vancouver route. [[Qantas]] took over this service shortly thereafter as BCPA subsequently ceased all operations and went out of business. [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] also used the island as well for its Douglas DC-4 service between Vancouver and the southern hemisphere.<ref>Degener & Gillaspy, p. 12.</ref> A full-scale community was established to support these airline operations, including an electrical power station, a hotel for the airline passengers' use, a medical dispensary, school for dependent children of station personnel, and other necessary facilities. The island was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British and American post offices were both operated from a single building. The American administrator, who was an employee of the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (predecessor to the [[FAA]]) and island manager for that agency, also served as the U.S. resident administrator under the Department of the Interior and as a U.S. special deputy marshal under the Department of Justice. William J.

This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft N743PA and N744PA, which provided feeder service from Auckland to three points on the jet service schedules. The last Pan Am flight was in November 1965 when the final DC-7C returned to Miami after the opening of a new airport in Auckland, enabling New Zealand to be added to Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] jet routes.

That year marked the complete end of the American presence; the airfield was abandoned and all U.S. personnel were removed.<ref>http://www.tighar.org/TTracks/14_1/Kanton_Mission.html.</ref> The British closed their [[post office]], ending their presence on Kanton as well. With the independence of [[Kiribati]] from Britain in 1979, the Anglo-American condominium was formally terminated, and the island transferred to Kiribati sovereignty.
