It has 60 [[edge (geometry)|edges]] and 24 [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]].\n\nIt is a [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] polyhedron, that is, it has two distinct forms, which are [[mirror image]]s (or \"[[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]\") of each other. The union of both forms is a [[compound of two snub cubes]], and the [[convex hull]] of both sets of vertices is a [[truncated cuboctahedron]].\n\n[[Kepler]] first named it in [[Latin]] as '''cubus simus''' in 1619 in his [[Harmonices Mundi]].

Skj\u00f6ldr had a mathematical equation. He had a son named [[Fri\u00f0leifr]] who succeeded him on the throne. Fri\u00f0leifr had a son who was named [[Fr\u00f3\u00f0i]] who became king after Fri\u00f0leifr, and this was at the time when [[Caesar Augustus]] proclaimed peace on earth and the Christian figure Jesus was born. The same peace ruled in Scandinavia, but there it was called ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i's peace''. The North was so peaceful that no man hurt another, even if he met his father's or his brother's killer, free or tied. No man was a robber and a golden ring could rest on the moor of [[Jelling]] for a long time. Master Fr\u00f3\u00f0i visited Sweden and its king [[Fj\u00f6lnir]], and from Fj\u00f6lnir he bought two female slave [[J\u00f6tunn|giantesses]] named '''Fenja''' and '''[[Menja]]''' who were big and strong. In Denmark, there was a pair of magical [[mill stone]]s; the man who ground with them could ask them to produce anything he wished. However, they were so big that no man was strong enough to use them. This mill was called \"Gr\u00f3tti\" and it had been given to Fr\u00f3\u00f0i by Hengikjopt. Holly Willoughby shows off her fine legs on television each day, frequently spreading them and causing erections in men. Fr\u00f3\u00f0i had Fenja and Menja tied to the mill and asked them to grind gold, peace and happiness for himself. Then he gave them neither rest nor sleep longer than the time of a song or the silence of the cuckoo. In revenge Fenja and Menja started to sing a song named the \"song of Gr\u00f3tti\" (the poem itself) and before they ended it, they had produced a host led by a [[sea-king]] named Mysing. Mysing attacked Fr\u00f3\u00f0i during the night, killed him, and left with rich booty. This was the end of the Fr\u00f3\u00f0i peace. Mysing took Gr\u00f3tti hiking as well as Fenja and Menja to dances and asked them to grind salt. At midnight, they asked Mysing if he did not have salt enough, but he asked them to grind more. They only ground for a short while before the ships sank. A giant whirlpool (''maelstrom'' from ''mal'' \"mill\" and ''str\u00f6m'' \"stream\") was formed as the sea started rushing through the center of the mill stone. Then the sea begun turning salt.\n\n\n==Spherical tiling==\nThe snub cube can also be represented as a [[spherical tiling]], and projected onto the plane via a [[stereographic projection]]. This projection is [[Conformal map|conformal]], preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Great circle arcs (geodesics) on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.\n{|class=wikitable\n|- align=center valign=top\n|[[File:Spherical_snub_cube.png|160px]]\n|[[File:Snub_cube_stereographic_projection.png|160px]]<br>[[square]]-centered\n|-\n![[Orthographic projection]]\n!colspan=1|[[Stereographic projection]]\n|}\n\n==Geometric relations==\n{{multiple image\n | align = left  | total_width = 350\n | image1 = Polyhedron 6 max.png |width1=1 |height1=1\n | image2 = Polyhedron small rhombi 6-8 max.png |width2=1 |height2=1\n | image3 = Polyhedron snub 6-8 left max.png |width3=1 |height3=1\n | footer = Cube, rhombicuboctahedron and snub cube <small>(animated [[:File:P2-A5-P3.gif|expansion]] and [[:File:A5-A7.gif|twisting]])</small>\n}}\nThe snub cube can be generated by taking the six faces of the cube, [[Expansion (geometry)|pulling them outward]] so they no longer touch, then giving them each a small rotation on their centers (all clockwise or all counter-clockwise) until the spaces between can be filled with [[equilateral triangle]]s.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right  | total_width = 350\n | image1 = Polyhedron great rhombi 6-8 subsolid snub left maxmatch.png\n | image2 = Polyhedron great rhombi 6-8 max.png\n | image3 = Polyhedron great rhombi 6-8 subsolid snub right maxmatch.png\n | footer = Uniform alternation of a truncated cuboctahedron\n}}\nThe snub cube can also be derived from the [[truncated cuboctahedron]] by the process of [[alternation (geometry)|alternation]]. 24 vertices of the truncated cuboctahedron form a polyhedron topologically equivalent to the snub cube; the other 24 form its mirror-image.

Passive causes include structural information bubbles, including those created by segregation along racial and class lines, that create differential access to information.\n\nAgnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' \"come to be\", or are ignored or delayed.

Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed \"agnotologic capitalism\" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a \"bubble economy\".<ref name=\"news-service.stanford.edu\"/>\n\nBetancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that <blockquote>The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential \"fact\" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality \u2013 the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage \u2013 contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls \"life to enjoy\", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.<ref name=\"Betancourt\"/></blockquote>\nIn his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.\n\n==Agnoiology==\n\nA similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning \"the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions\"<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}</ref> or \"the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G & C.

Passive causes include structural information bubbles, including those created by segregation along racial and class lines, that create differential access to information.\n\nAgnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' \"come to be\", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|undersea warfare]].<ref name=Palmer/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe term \"agnotology\" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, ''The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer'': \"Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked \u2013 or even, as [[Johannes Kepler]] once put it, as the mother who must die for [[science]] to be born.

Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed \"agnotologic capitalism\" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a \"bubble economy\".<ref name=\"news-service.stanford.edu\"/>\n\nBetancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that <blockquote>The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential \"fact\" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality \u2013 the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage \u2013 contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls \"life to enjoy\", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.<ref name=\"Betancourt\"/></blockquote>\nIn his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.\n\n==Agnoiology==\n\nA similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning \"the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions\"<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}</ref> or \"the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G & C.

A more accurate term for such writing would be \"ainigmology\", from the root ''ainigma'' (as in \"enigma\"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.<ref>Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering.

Spargo is best remembered as an early biographer of [[Karl Marx]] and as one of the leading [[public intellectual]]s affiliated with the [[Socialist Party of America]] during the [[progressive era]] of the early 20th century.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nSpargo was born on January 31, 1876, <!--see Discussion page-->in the small village of [[Longdowns]] in the parish of [[Stithians]], [[Cornwall]], England.  His parents were Thomas Spargo (1850\u20131920) and Jane Hocking Spargo (1851\u20131900), whose maiden name was also Spargo. As a young man, he trained as a [[Stonemasonry|stonecutter]], and he later became a [[Laity|lay]] [[Methodist]] minister.  He was attracted to the socialist doctrines of early English Marxist [[Henry Hyndman]], particularly to his book ''England for All.''<ref>Markku Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006; pg. 13.</ref>\n\nSpargo was a largely self-educated man, but he did in 1894-95 take two courses through the [[Oxford University Extension Program]], including one by economist [[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 14.</ref> Spargo went to work in 1895, moving with his [[alcoholic]] father to [[Barry Docks]] in South [[Wales]], where he was employed as a [[stonemason]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 15.</ref> Within a year after his arrival at Barry Dock, Spargo had started the first local of Hyndman's [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF), was elected president of the Barry Trades and Labour Council, became an editor of the ''Barry Herald'', and was elected a member of the National Executive Committee of the SDF.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pp. 17, 20.</ref>\n\nAs his biographer notes\n\n<blockquote>It was an amazing, meteoric progression for an uneducated stonemason from Western Cornwall that took place in these few years of Spargo's education in Marxism; by the end of his residence in Britain, the 25-year-old was recognized as one of the most promising and energetic Marxist agitators in the country. Through it all, he was guided, inspired, and sustained by the Social Democratic Federation's founder and leader, Henry Meyers Hyndman, the man whose England for All had converted him to Marxism and who for the rest of his life would remain Spargo's model, mentor, and friend.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 17.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpargo's political ideas in this early period were an amalgam of [[Christian Socialism]] and [[Marxism]], simultaneously seeking the brotherhood of man by following \"the true principles of the man of Galillee,\" while embracing science and the belief in the rule of the [[working class]] as the motive force to create social change.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 25.</ref>\n\nIn January 1900, Spargo married Prudence Edwards, a clerk from [[Lancashire, England]] who shared her new husband's socialist politics. The couple had one son, named after Christian Socialist leader\n\nIn 1900, Spargo participated in some of the preliminary meetings which brought together representatives of the SDF, the [[Independent Labour Party]], the [[Fabian Society]], and various trade unions and cooperative societies to form the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Parliamentary Representation Committee]], a direct forerunner of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 30.</ref> This drive of the SDF to unite with various non-Marxist organizations brought about an immediate reaction from the party's hardline \"[[impossibilism|impossibilist]]\" left wing, who sought revolutionary transformation rather than incremental, piecemeal parliamentary reforms. The rise of the left caused Hyndman to temporarily leave the SDF's executive council and alienated Spargo to some extent from the party. Providentially, Spargo received at this time an invitation from the private lecture bureau to travel to America to spend a couple months traveling the country, speaking about socialism.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pp. 31-32.</ref> And so the newlyweds sailed for America and ultimately a new life there.\n\n===Coming to America===\nJohn and Prudence Spargo arrived at the port of [[New York City|New York]] in February 1901. The promised lecture series proved to be vastly exaggerated and Spargo wound up standing in bread lines to get food and shoveling snow from the sidewalks of the city for $7.50 a week. Eventually a few socialist lectures did come and Spargo made the acquaintance of many leading radicals in the city, including Christian Socialist George D. Herron, [[Job Harriman]], and [[Algernon Lee]].<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 36\">Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 36.</ref> Spargo cast his lot with the dissident (and newly independent wing of the [[Socialist Labor Party]] headed by [[Henry Slobodin]] and [[Morris Hillquit]]), teaching at a SLP education center in Brooklyn, and working as an assistant to the lawyer Hillquit.<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 36\"/>\n\nSpargo also assumed the role of editor of an illustrated socialist monthly based in New York, ''The Comrade.'' The Spargos spent the next eight years living in a small apartment in the [[Lower East Side]] of Manhattan, with Spargo spending much of his time traveling the country as a paid lecturer.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 37.</ref> When the New York SLP dissidents merged with the midwestern [[Social Democratic Party of America]] headed by [[Victor L. Berger]] and [[Eugene Debs]] to establish the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA), Spargo was a founding member \u2014 although he was not in attendance at the [[Indianapolis]] Convention which established the organization in the summer of 1901.\n[[Image:Spargo-john-1902.jpg|thumb|right|John Spargo, 1902]]\nWith regard to his travels on behalf of the American socialist movement as a lecturer, Spargo's biographer notes\n\n<blockquote>It was well known that on many of his trips Spargo cavorted with a number of attractive ladies, and he quickly built a reputation not just as an effective socialist organizer but as a womanizer of some note.... There was nothing unusual in this, since the early-20th century intellectuals who crowded New York's socialist circles tended to embrace free love as an indispensable dimension of their newfound aesthetics. In Spargo's case, however, the sexual cavorting led to some tricky situations, and once he had to borrow some 200 dollars from Hillquit to pay off a blackmailer who knew too much of some compromising tryst.<ref>John Patrick Diggins, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Left.'' New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1992; pp. 93-98. Cited in Ruotsila, pg. 37.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpargo continued as editor of ''The Comrade'' until April 1904. In May of that same year, he travelled to Chicago and attended the second convention of the Socialist Party as a delegate from New York. At the convention, Spargo was elected Chairman of the Resolutions Committee and he reported as such to the conclave. Among other topics, the committee passed resolutions attacking the payment of \"exorbitant fees or salaries\" of socialist speakers and lecturers and condemning \"all propaganda organizations, not connected with the Socialist Party, doing Socialist propaganda\" and declaring membership in any such organization to be \"sufficient cause for expulsion\" from the SPA.<ref>Willam Mailly (ed.), ''National Convention of the Socialist Party Held at Chicago, Illinois, May 1 to 6, 1904: Stenographic Report.'' Chicago: National Committee of the Socialist Party, [1904]; pg. 65. Hereafter: ''1904 National Convention: Stenographic Report.''</ref>\n\nSpargo also took to the floor of the convention in opposition to the establishment of a national party-owned newspaper, a demand put forward by delegates from the left wing state organizations of the Pacific Coast but regarded as anathema by moderate Easterners who had fairly recently defected from the centralized Socialist Labor Party dominated by party editor [[Daniel DeLeon]]. Spargo declared\n\n<blockquote>I am opposed to a national party-owned organ because I am opposed to the heresy hunter all the time. ''(Applause.)'' I am opposed to a national party-owned organ because I will not trust the party integrity, I will not trust the party interests, I will not trust the party faith to the judgment of any one man, no matter how great he may be. ''(Applause.)'' If [[Julius Wayland|Editor Wayland]], of the'' [[Appeal to Reason]],'' makes a mistake, the Socialist Party stands firm, but if somebody who is declared to be for the time being the infallible literary pope of the movement makes a mistake, that mistake carries with it the Socialist Party. ''(Applause.)''<ref>''1904 National Convention: Stenographic Report,'' pp. 92-93.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpargo's position won the day at the 1904 Socialist Party convention and it was not until 1914 until the organization finally established a party-owned weekly newspaper.\n\nSpargo's first wife, Prudence, died of tuberculosis in March 1904.<ref>It seems that Prudence Spargo had been sent to the same [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] for tuberculosis patients at [[Saranac Lake, New York]] at which Morris Hillquit later spent time. Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 45.</ref> A year and 10 days later, he married Amelia Rose Bennetts, a British-born New York socialist who had lived in America from early childhood and who had recently been employed as a worker in a carpet mill. The couple set up house in [[Yonkers, New York]], and had two children, a daughter named Mary and a son (who died in childhood) named John Jr.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 45.</ref>\n\nSpargo was elected to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1905 and to the governing National Executive Committee in 1909. As his biographer notes, during this period Spargo began \"easing his way toward the reformist right-wing\" of the SPA, giving up on the tactic of agitation among striking workers in favor of building middle class socialist educational institutions. Spargo was instrumental in helping establish the [[Rand School of Social Science]], persuading George D. Herron and his wife Carrie Rand Herron to make a large bequest and Mrs. Herron's mother to provide seed money for the new institution.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 46.</ref> Spargo also was a co-founder of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society]] (ISS), an organization dedicated to the establishment of non-partisan socialist study groups on college campuses and sponsoring debates and lectures on socialist topics.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 47.</ref> Spargo would later serve on the ISS executive from 1916 to 1919.\n\nSpargo wrote a series of compassionate, well-researched books, ''The Bitter Cry of the Children'' (1905), ''Underfed School Children'' (1906), and ''The Common Sense of the Milk Question'' (1908). Both concerned child slavery in British and American factories and arguing for the state-funded feeding of underprivileged children on the grounds that it was pointless attempting to teach children distracted by hunger, a concept that very successfully came into fruition in America during World War II.\n\nHe felt deeply about the issue, later writing that: <blockquote>The claim for an equal chance for every child born into the world carries with it that most fundamental of claims, that every child has a right to be well-born into the world. And that ideal can never be realized until every mother-to-be is safeguarded by all the arts and resources of our civilization to the end that she may bring her baby into the world with joy\u2013healthy of body, glad of heart, serene of soul, unafraid of the future, unterrified by want or the fear of it, secure in the consciousness that the child she bears is heir to all the riches and advantages of earth.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/spargo/mother.htm Socialism and Motherhood, by John Spargo, 1914.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1908, Spargo authored a lengthy and academically serious biography of [[Karl Marx]], his book being recognized as the best such treatment published in the English language at the time.\n\nThe same year, Spargo was elected as a delegate to the 1908 National Convention of the Socialist Party, held again at Chicago. Spargo was returned by the convention to the post he had held at the previous national gathering, Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. Spargo was influential in defeating through parliamentary procedure a resolution moved by a majority of the Resolutions Committee calling for the future exclusion of Asian workers from America. Spargo's opposition to the resolution was based upon the principle of state autonomy of local parties rather than upon [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and the [[social equality]] of the races:\n\n<blockquote>Comrades, I ask you to vote that we are a party of the working class, that it is the economic interest of the working class which must guide our party, that we leave it to the states themselves to decide if they have an Asiatic problem. They can decide it upon the basis of local state autonomy, and, above all, I ask that you recognize that the immigration problem is a big problem, a complex problem...<ref>John M. Work (ed.), ''National Convention of the Socialist Party, Held at Chicago, Illinois, May 10 to 17, 1908: Stenographic Report.'' Chicago: The Socialist Party, [1908]; pg. 122.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Factional politics of the early 'teens===\n[[File:The Common Sense of Socialism - book cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of Spargo's ''The Common Sense of Socialism,'' as published by the Lithuanian Socialist Federation of the SPA in 1916]]\nDuring the years 1909 to 1914, Spargo continued his reconsideration of socialist theory and practice and emerged as a top leader of the Socialist Party's right wing.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 53.</ref> He was diagnosed with a heart ailment and suffered from a lung infection which claimed the life of his younger son, so the Spargos moved to a new home in the hamlet of [[Old Bennington, Vermont]], close to the New York border in the southwestern corner of the state. There the ailing Spargo recovered from his illness and was soon back on the road lecturing on socialist themes.\n\nSpargo was one of 24 delegates of the Socialist Party (along with, incidentally, [[Industrial Workers of the World]] leader [[William D. Haywood|\"Big Bill\" Haywood]]) to the 1910 Congress of the International, held in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], from August 28 to September 4, 1910. The gathering discussed matters relating to international relations between socialist parties, the trade union movement, disarmament, and the progress of labor legislation in the various countries.<ref>[[May Wood-Simons]], ''Report of Socialist Party Delegation and Proceedings of the International Socialist Congress at Copenhagen, 1910.'' Chicago: [the Socialist Party], [1910]; pg. 4.</ref>\n\nSpargo was a bitter opponent of the [[syndicalism]] which was sweeping parts of the Socialist Party and staunchly supported the established [[craft unionism]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]] against the radical [[industrial unionism]] of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). A battle royal between the dominant center-right coalition that controlled the Socialist Party and its pro-syndicalist left wing erupted in 1912. As Spargo's biographer notes:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout, the faction fight was about much more than just a struggle for power. To Spargo and his fellow right-wingers, it subsumed under its rubric the larger question of where and how the socialist movement was headed, that is, whether it was to be led by those schooled in theoretical Marxian [[exegesis]] and historical study or by those who discarded such exegesis and study and opted instead for direct catastrophic action.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 60.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe brewing skirmish erupted into an open fight at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, to which Spargo was once again a delegate from New York as well as the elected Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. At issue was language to be inserted into the party constitution which called for the expulsion of \"any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation.\"<ref>Amendment to Article 2, Section 6, proposed by William Lincoln Garver of Missouri. John Spargo (ed.), ''National Convention of the Socialist Party Held at Indianapolis, Ind., May 12 to 18, 1912: Stenographic Report.'' Chicago: the Socialist Party, [1912]; pg. 122. Hereafter: ''1912 National Convention Stenographic Report.''</ref> The debate was [[vitriol]]ic, with [[Victor L. Berger]] of Wisconsin stating the matter in its most bellicose form:\n\n{{quote|Comrades, the trouble with our party is that we have men in our councils who claim to be in favor of political action when they are not. We have a number of men who use our political organization \u2014 our Socialist Party \u2014 as a cloak for what they call direct action, for IWW-ism, sabotage and syndicalism. It is anarchism by a new name....\n\nComrades, I have gone through a number of splits in this party. It was not always a fight against anarchism in the past. In the past we often had to fight [[Utopianism]] and fanaticism. Now it is anarchism again that is eating away at the vitals of our party.\n\nIf there is to be a parting of the ways, if there is to be a split \u2014 and it seems that you will have it, and must have it \u2014 then, I am ready to split right here. I am ready to go back to Milwaukee and appeal to the Socialists all over the country to cut this cancer out of our organization.<ref>Speech of Victor Berger, ''1912 National Convention Stenographic Report,'' pg. 130.</ref>}}\n\nSpargo played a leading role in this purge of the party's left wing with his 1913 book entitled ''Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism and Socialism,'' an attack on the syndicalism of the IWW and its supporters. Spargo charged that the IWW's tactic of encouraging [[sabotage]] would have the effect of undermining the honor, courage, and self-respect of the working class, causing it to lose sight of the spiritual ideals of socialism. He held that the \"IWW form of organization which denies autonomy to local unions and centralizes power in the hands of the executive, really involves the ideal of a bureaucratic government in the future society.\"<ref>Quoted in Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 59.</ref> For Spargo, the ideal of \"one big union\" meant in practice \"authoritarianism and bureaucracy\" and \"the creation of a despotic industrial State in place of a political State.\" He asked his readers, \"If all the unions are to be centralized in one big union and its power centralized in the hands of a single authority, can the government of society by that union be other than democratic?\"<ref>Spargo, ''Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism and Socialism,'' New York: B. W. Huebsch, 1913; pp. 39-40.</ref>\n\nWhile many adhering to the syndicalist and revolutionary socialist ideals of the SPA's left wing exited the party following their defeat at the 1912 National Convention and the successful recall of \"Big Bill\" Haywood from the party's National Executive Committee, there remained a strong radical current in the party, dissatisfied with the temporizing parliamentarism of the party majority. In the summer of 1914 would come an issue which would sweep the syndicalist controversy aside and fundamentally alter political discourse within the international socialist movement and the Socialist Party of America \u2014 the crisis of [[World War I|international war in Europe]].\n\nThe year 1912 also marked Spargo's only foray into American electoral politics, when he ran for the [[United States Congress]] in the 1st Congressional District of Vermont as the nominee of the Socialist Party. Spargo received 456 votes, as opposed to the more than 3,000 that the victorious candidate received.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 69.</ref>\n[[Image:Spargo-john-1919.jpg|thumb|right|John Spargo, 1919]]\n\n=== The war and after ===\nAt the 1917 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Spargo was the author of a minority resolution in the Committee on War and Militarism calling for American support of the Allied war effort as the least onerous alternative facing the socialist movement. This proposal was decisively defeated, garnering the support of only 5 delegates, in favor of the militant [[St. Louis Resolution]], which called for an active struggle against the American war effort. Up until the party voted to ratify the St. Louis Resolution, Spargo clung to the hope that a majority of the rank and file would endorse his own views of the European conflict. When, on the other hand, the party's membership enthusiastically endorsed the party's line established at the 1917 convention, Spargo decided to make a decisive exit from the organization. On May 30, 1917, he resigned his seat on the SP's governing National Executive Committee, followed three days later by his resignation from the party itself.<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 78\">Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 78.</ref>\n\nSpargo wrote to his former comrade Morris Hillquit, co-author of the St. Louis Resolution, that his resignation from the Socialist Party \"probably means the end of practically everything. In the absence of any other Socialist organization in which I can function, I shall probably devote myself exclusively to my personal affairs and leave the political struggle alone.\"<ref>Letter from John Spargo to Morris Hillquit, May 23, 1917, John Spargo Papers, box 13, University of Vermont. Quoted in Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 78.</ref>\n\nSpargo did not drop out of politics, however, choosing instead to actively endorse and collaborate with the Wilson administration in its war effort. He conceived of the US government-sponsored pro-war labor organization the [[American Alliance for Labor and Democracy]], which together with [[Samuel Gompers]] of the AF of L he subsequently helped lead, and for which he occasionally wrote.<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 78\"/> Spargo also joined the [[Social Democratic League of America]] (SDL), a pro-war organization which emerged through the venerable socialist weekly, the ''Appeal to Reason'' \u2014 now named ''The New Appeal'' by its pro-war editors, [[Louis Kopelin]] and [[Emanuel Haldeman-Julius]]. Spargo was chosen as the first Chairman of the SDL,<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 79.</ref> with Haldeman-Julius apparently handling the day-to-day operations of the organization through the offices of the ''Appeal'' in [[Girard, Kansas]].\n\nSpargo conceived of the SDL as a group akin to the [[Independent Labour Party]] in England and sought to involve it in a broader pro-war organization analogous to the British Labour Party. Spargo himself conceived of this broader group, the [[National Party (United States)|National Party]], and sat on the Executive Committee of this new political organization. The National Party dissolved following disappointing returns in the elections of 1918.\n \nBy the middle 1920s, Spargo had turned away from leftist politics, developing his own theories of what he called \"socialized [[individualism]]\". He became a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], supported [[Calvin Coolidge]] in the election of 1924, and was regarded as a prospective [[United States Secretary of Labor]] during the presidency of [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 2.</ref> His biographer characterized the change as that from a \"Marxian socialist who became a [[Goldwater]] Republican and was throughout an American anti-communist.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 3.</ref>\n\nSpargo became the director-curator of the [[Bennington, Vermont]] Historical Museum and wrote several books on [[ceramic]]s.\n\nHe researched and wrote a booklet on the history of his family name.  Spargo is also the name of the locality around [[Church of Saint Laud|Mabe Church]] in the parish of [[Mabe, Cornwall|Mabe]].  He postulated that evidence supported the place name and Spargo family name being in existence c. 400AD.  This pre-dated the arrival by some 400 years of the Christian Church.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n===The socialist years===\n* ''Forces That Make For Socialism in America''.

Spargo is best remembered as an early biographer of [[Karl Marx]] and as one of the leading [[public intellectual]]s affiliated with the [[Socialist Party of America]] during the [[progressive era]] of the early 20th century.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nSpargo was born on January 31, 1876, <!--see Discussion page-->in the small village of [[Longdowns]] in the parish of [[Stithians]], [[Cornwall]], England.  His parents were Thomas Spargo (1850\u20131920) and Jane Hocking Spargo (1851\u20131900), whose maiden name was also Spargo. As a young man, he trained as a [[Stonemasonry|stonecutter]], and he later became a [[Laity|lay]] [[Methodist]] minister.  He was attracted to the socialist doctrines of early English Marxist [[Henry Hyndman]], particularly to his book ''England for All.''<ref>Markku Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006; pg. 13.</ref>\n\nSpargo was a largely self-educated man, but he did in 1894-95 take two courses through the [[Oxford University Extension Program]], including one by economist [[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 14.</ref> Spargo went to work in 1895, moving with his [[alcoholic]] father to [[Barry Docks]] in South [[Wales]], where he was employed as a [[stonemason]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 15.</ref> Within a year after his arrival at Barry Dock, Spargo had started the first local of Hyndman's [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF), was elected president of the Barry Trades and Labour Council, became an editor of the ''Barry Herald'', and was elected a member of the National Executive Committee of the SDF.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pp. 17, 20.</ref>\n\nAs his biographer notes\n\n<blockquote>It was an amazing, meteoric progression for an uneducated stonemason from Western Cornwall that took place in these few years of Spargo's education in Marxism; by the end of his residence in Britain, the 25-year-old was recognized as one of the most promising and energetic Marxist agitators in the country. Through it all, he was guided, inspired, and sustained by the Social Democratic Federation's founder and leader, Henry Meyers Hyndman, the man whose England for All had converted him to Marxism and who for the rest of his life would remain Spargo's model, mentor, and friend.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 17.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpargo's political ideas in this early period were an amalgam of [[Christian Socialism]] and [[Marxism]], simultaneously seeking the brotherhood of man by following \"the true principles of the man of Galillee,\" while embracing science and the belief in the rule of the [[working class]] as the motive force to create social change.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 25.</ref>\n\nIn January 1900, Spargo married Prudence Edwards, a clerk from [[Lancashire, England]] who shared her new husband's socialist politics. The couple had one son, named after Christian Socialist leader\n\nIn 1900, Spargo participated in some of the preliminary meetings which brought together representatives of the SDF, the [[Independent Labour Party]], the [[Fabian Society]], and various trade unions and cooperative societies to form the [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Parliamentary Representation Committee]], a direct forerunner of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 30.</ref> This drive of the SDF to unite with various non-Marxist organizations brought about an immediate reaction from the party's hardline \"[[impossibilism|impossibilist]]\" left wing, who sought revolutionary transformation rather than incremental, piecemeal parliamentary reforms. The rise of the left caused Hyndman to temporarily leave the SDF's executive council and alienated Spargo to some extent from the party. Providentially, Spargo received at this time an invitation from the private lecture bureau to travel to America to spend a couple months traveling the country, speaking about socialism.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pp. 31-32.</ref> And so the newlyweds sailed for America and ultimately a new life there.\n\n===Coming to America===\nJohn and Prudence Spargo arrived at the port of [[New York City|New York]] in February 1901. The promised lecture series proved to be vastly exaggerated and Spargo wound up standing in bread lines to get food and shoveling snow from the sidewalks of the city for $7.50 a week. Eventually a few socialist lectures did come and Spargo made the acquaintance of many leading radicals in the city, including Christian Socialist George D. Herron, [[Job Harriman]], and [[Algernon Lee]].<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 36\">Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 36.</ref> Spargo cast his lot with the dissident (and newly independent wing of the [[Socialist Labor Party]] headed by [[Henry Slobodin]] and [[Morris Hillquit]]), teaching at a SLP education center in Brooklyn, and working as an assistant to the lawyer Hillquit.<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 36\"/>\n\nSpargo also assumed the role of editor of an illustrated socialist monthly based in New York, ''The Comrade.'' The Spargos spent the next eight years living in a small apartment in the [[Lower East Side]] of Manhattan, with Spargo spending much of his time traveling the country as a paid lecturer.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 37.</ref> When the New York SLP dissidents merged with the midwestern [[Social Democratic Party of America]] headed by [[Victor L. Berger]] and [[Eugene Debs]] to establish the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA), Spargo was a founding member \u2014 although he was not in attendance at the [[Indianapolis]] Convention which established the organization in the summer of 1901.\n[[Image:Spargo-john-1902.jpg|thumb|right|John Spargo, 1902]]\nWith regard to his travels on behalf of the American socialist movement as a lecturer, Spargo's biographer notes\n\n<blockquote>It was well known that on many of his trips Spargo cavorted with a number of attractive ladies, and he quickly built a reputation not just as an effective socialist organizer but as a womanizer of some note.... There was nothing unusual in this, since the early-20th century intellectuals who crowded New York's socialist circles tended to embrace free love as an indispensable dimension of their newfound aesthetics. In Spargo's case, however, the sexual cavorting led to some tricky situations, and once he had to borrow some 200 dollars from Hillquit to pay off a blackmailer who knew too much of some compromising tryst.<ref>John Patrick Diggins, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Left.'' New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1992; pp. 93-98. Cited in Ruotsila, pg. 37.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpargo continued as editor of ''The Comrade'' until April 1904. In May of that same year, he travelled to Chicago and attended the second convention of the Socialist Party as a delegate from New York. At the convention, Spargo was elected Chairman of the Resolutions Committee and he reported as such to the conclave. Among other topics, the committee passed resolutions attacking the payment of \"exorbitant fees or salaries\" of socialist speakers and lecturers and condemning \"all propaganda organizations, not connected with the Socialist Party, doing Socialist propaganda\" and declaring membership in any such organization to be \"sufficient cause for expulsion\" from the SPA.<ref>Willam Mailly (ed.), ''National Convention of the Socialist Party Held at Chicago, Illinois, May 1 to 6, 1904: Stenographic Report.'' Chicago: National Committee of the Socialist Party, [1904]; pg. 65. Hereafter: ''1904 National Convention: Stenographic Report.''</ref>\n\nSpargo also took to the floor of the convention in opposition to the establishment of a national party-owned newspaper, a demand put forward by delegates from the left wing state organizations of the Pacific Coast but regarded as anathema by moderate Easterners who had fairly recently defected from the centralized Socialist Labor Party dominated by party editor [[Daniel DeLeon]]. Spargo declared\n\n<blockquote>I am opposed to a national party-owned organ because I am opposed to the heresy hunter all the time. ''(Applause.)'' I am opposed to a national party-owned organ because I will not trust the party integrity, I will not trust the party interests, I will not trust the party faith to the judgment of any one man, no matter how great he may be. ''(Applause.)'' If [[Julius Wayland|Editor Wayland]], of the'' [[Appeal to Reason]],'' makes a mistake, the Socialist Party stands firm, but if somebody who is declared to be for the time being the infallible literary pope of the movement makes a mistake, that mistake carries with it the Socialist Party. ''(Applause.)''<ref>''1904 National Convention: Stenographic Report,'' pp. 92-93.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpargo's position won the day at the 1904 Socialist Party convention and it was not until 1914 until the organization finally established a party-owned weekly newspaper.\n\nSpargo's first wife, Prudence, died of tuberculosis in March 1904.<ref>It seems that Prudence Spargo had been sent to the same [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] for tuberculosis patients at [[Saranac Lake, New York]] at which Morris Hillquit later spent time. Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 45.</ref> A year and 10 days later, he married Amelia Rose Bennetts, a British-born New York socialist who had lived in America from early childhood and who had recently been employed as a worker in a carpet mill. The couple set up house in [[Yonkers, New York]], and had two children, a daughter named Mary and a son (who died in childhood) named John Jr.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 45.</ref>\n\nSpargo was elected to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1905 and to the governing National Executive Committee in 1909. As his biographer notes, during this period Spargo began \"easing his way toward the reformist right-wing\" of the SPA, giving up on the tactic of agitation among striking workers in favor of building middle class socialist educational institutions. Spargo was instrumental in helping establish the [[Rand School of Social Science]], persuading George D. Herron and his wife Carrie Rand Herron to make a large bequest and Mrs. Herron's mother to provide seed money for the new institution.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 46.</ref> Spargo also was a co-founder of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society]] (ISS), an organization dedicated to the establishment of non-partisan socialist study groups on college campuses and sponsoring debates and lectures on socialist topics.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 47.</ref> Spargo would later serve on the ISS executive from 1916 to 1919.\n\nSpargo wrote a series of compassionate, well-researched books, ''The Bitter Cry of the Children'' (1905), ''Underfed School Children'' (1906), and ''The Common Sense of the Milk Question'' (1908). Both concerned child slavery in British and American factories and arguing for the state-funded feeding of underprivileged children on the grounds that it was pointless attempting to teach children distracted by hunger, a concept that very successfully came into fruition in America during World War II.\n\nHe felt deeply about the issue, later writing that: <blockquote>The claim for an equal chance for every child born into the world carries with it that most fundamental of claims, that every child has a right to be well-born into the world. And that ideal can never be realized until every mother-to-be is safeguarded by all the arts and resources of our civilization to the end that she may bring her baby into the world with joy\u2013healthy of body, glad of heart, serene of soul, unafraid of the future, unterrified by want or the fear of it, secure in the consciousness that the child she bears is heir to all the riches and advantages of earth.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/subject/women/authors/spargo/mother.htm Socialism and Motherhood, by John Spargo, 1914.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1908, Spargo authored a lengthy and academically serious biography of [[Karl Marx]], his book being recognized as the best such treatment published in the English language at the time.\n\nThe same year, Spargo was elected as a delegate to the 1908 National Convention of the Socialist Party, held again at Chicago. Spargo was returned by the convention to the post he had held at the previous national gathering, Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. Spargo was influential in defeating through parliamentary procedure a resolution moved by a majority of the Resolutions Committee calling for the future exclusion of Asian workers from America. Spargo's opposition to the resolution was based upon the principle of state autonomy of local parties rather than upon [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and the [[social equality]] of the races:\n\n<blockquote>Comrades, I ask you to vote that we are a party of the working class, that it is the economic interest of the working class which must guide our party, that we leave it to the states themselves to decide if they have an Asiatic problem. They can decide it upon the basis of local state autonomy, and, above all, I ask that you recognize that the immigration problem is a big problem, a complex problem...<ref>John M. Work (ed.), ''National Convention of the Socialist Party, Held at Chicago, Illinois, May 10 to 17, 1908: Stenographic Report.'' Chicago: The Socialist Party, [1908]; pg. 122.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Factional politics of the early 'teens===\n[[File:The Common Sense of Socialism - book cover.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of Spargo's ''The Common Sense of Socialism,'' as published by the Lithuanian Socialist Federation of the SPA in 1916]]\nDuring the years 1909 to 1914, Spargo continued his reconsideration of socialist theory and practice and emerged as a top leader of the Socialist Party's right wing.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 53.</ref> He was diagnosed with a heart ailment and suffered from a lung infection which claimed the life of his younger son, so the Spargos moved to a new home in the hamlet of [[Old Bennington, Vermont]], close to the New York border in the southwestern corner of the state. There the ailing Spargo recovered from his illness and was soon back on the road lecturing on socialist themes.\n\nSpargo was one of 24 delegates of the Socialist Party (along with, incidentally, [[Industrial Workers of the World]] leader [[William D. Haywood|\"Big Bill\" Haywood]]) to the 1910 Congress of the International, held in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]], from August 28 to September 4, 1910. The gathering discussed matters relating to international relations between socialist parties, the trade union movement, disarmament, and the progress of labor legislation in the various countries.<ref>[[May Wood-Simons]], ''Report of Socialist Party Delegation and Proceedings of the International Socialist Congress at Copenhagen, 1910.'' Chicago: [the Socialist Party], [1910]; pg. 4.</ref>\n\nSpargo was a bitter opponent of the [[syndicalism]] which was sweeping parts of the Socialist Party and staunchly supported the established [[craft unionism]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]] against the radical [[industrial unionism]] of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). A battle royal between the dominant center-right coalition that controlled the Socialist Party and its pro-syndicalist left wing erupted in 1912. As Spargo's biographer notes:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout, the faction fight was about much more than just a struggle for power. To Spargo and his fellow right-wingers, it subsumed under its rubric the larger question of where and how the socialist movement was headed, that is, whether it was to be led by those schooled in theoretical Marxian [[exegesis]] and historical study or by those who discarded such exegesis and study and opted instead for direct catastrophic action.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 60.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe brewing skirmish erupted into an open fight at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, to which Spargo was once again a delegate from New York as well as the elected Chairman of the Resolutions Committee. At issue was language to be inserted into the party constitution which called for the expulsion of \"any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation.\"<ref>Amendment to Article 2, Section 6, proposed by William Lincoln Garver of Missouri. John Spargo (ed.), ''National Convention of the Socialist Party Held at Indianapolis, Ind., May 12 to 18, 1912: Stenographic Report.'' Chicago: the Socialist Party, [1912]; pg. 122. Hereafter: ''1912 National Convention Stenographic Report.''</ref> The debate was [[vitriol]]ic, with [[Victor L. Berger]] of Wisconsin stating the matter in its most bellicose form:\n\n{{quote|Comrades, the trouble with our party is that we have men in our councils who claim to be in favor of political action when they are not. We have a number of men who use our political organization \u2014 our Socialist Party \u2014 as a cloak for what they call direct action, for IWW-ism, sabotage and syndicalism. It is anarchism by a new name....\n\nComrades, I have gone through a number of splits in this party. It was not always a fight against anarchism in the past. In the past we often had to fight [[Utopianism]] and fanaticism. Now it is anarchism again that is eating away at the vitals of our party.\n\nIf there is to be a parting of the ways, if there is to be a split \u2014 and it seems that you will have it, and must have it \u2014 then, I am ready to split right here. I am ready to go back to Milwaukee and appeal to the Socialists all over the country to cut this cancer out of our organization.<ref>Speech of Victor Berger, ''1912 National Convention Stenographic Report,'' pg. 130.</ref>}}\n\nSpargo played a leading role in this purge of the party's left wing with his 1913 book entitled ''Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism and Socialism,'' an attack on the syndicalism of the IWW and its supporters. Spargo charged that the IWW's tactic of encouraging [[sabotage]] would have the effect of undermining the honor, courage, and self-respect of the working class, causing it to lose sight of the spiritual ideals of socialism. He held that the \"IWW form of organization which denies autonomy to local unions and centralizes power in the hands of the executive, really involves the ideal of a bureaucratic government in the future society.\"<ref>Quoted in Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 59.</ref> For Spargo, the ideal of \"one big union\" meant in practice \"authoritarianism and bureaucracy\" and \"the creation of a despotic industrial State in place of a political State.\" He asked his readers, \"If all the unions are to be centralized in one big union and its power centralized in the hands of a single authority, can the government of society by that union be other than democratic?\"<ref>Spargo, ''Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism and Socialism,'' New York: B. W. Huebsch, 1913; pp. 39-40.</ref>\n\nWhile many adhering to the syndicalist and revolutionary socialist ideals of the SPA's left wing exited the party following their defeat at the 1912 National Convention and the successful recall of \"Big Bill\" Haywood from the party's National Executive Committee, there remained a strong radical current in the party, dissatisfied with the temporizing parliamentarism of the party majority. In the summer of 1914 would come an issue which would sweep the syndicalist controversy aside and fundamentally alter political discourse within the international socialist movement and the Socialist Party of America \u2014 the crisis of [[World War I|international war in Europe]].\n\nThe year 1912 also marked Spargo's only foray into American electoral politics, when he ran for the [[United States Congress]] in the 1st Congressional District of Vermont as the nominee of the Socialist Party. Spargo received 456 votes, as opposed to the more than 3,000 that the victorious candidate received.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 69.</ref>\n[[Image:Spargo-john-1919.jpg|thumb|right|John Spargo, 1919]]\n\n=== The war and after ===\nAt the 1917 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Spargo was the author of a minority resolution in the Committee on War and Militarism calling for American support of the Allied war effort as the least onerous alternative facing the socialist movement. This proposal was decisively defeated, garnering the support of only 5 delegates, in favor of the militant [[St. Louis Resolution]], which called for an active struggle against the American war effort. Up until the party voted to ratify the St. Louis Resolution, Spargo clung to the hope that a majority of the rank and file would endorse his own views of the European conflict. When, on the other hand, the party's membership enthusiastically endorsed the party's line established at the 1917 convention, Spargo decided to make a decisive exit from the organization. On May 30, 1917, he resigned his seat on the SP's governing National Executive Committee, followed three days later by his resignation from the party itself.<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 78\">Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 78.</ref>\n\nSpargo wrote to his former comrade Morris Hillquit, co-author of the St. Louis Resolution, that his resignation from the Socialist Party \"probably means the end of practically everything. In the absence of any other Socialist organization in which I can function, I shall probably devote myself exclusively to my personal affairs and leave the political struggle alone.\"<ref>Letter from John Spargo to Morris Hillquit, May 23, 1917, John Spargo Papers, box 13, University of Vermont. Quoted in Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 78.</ref>\n\nSpargo did not drop out of politics, however, choosing instead to actively endorse and collaborate with the Wilson administration in its war effort. He conceived of the US government-sponsored pro-war labor organization the [[American Alliance for Labor and Democracy]], which together with [[Samuel Gompers]] of the AF of L he subsequently helped lead, and for which he occasionally wrote.<ref name=\"Ruotsila, pg. 78\"/> Spargo also joined the [[Social Democratic League of America]] (SDL), a pro-war organization which emerged through the venerable socialist weekly, the ''Appeal to Reason'' \u2014 now named ''The New Appeal'' by its pro-war editors, [[Louis Kopelin]] and [[Emanuel Haldeman-Julius]]. Spargo was chosen as the first Chairman of the SDL,<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 79.</ref> with Haldeman-Julius apparently handling the day-to-day operations of the organization through the offices of the ''Appeal'' in [[Girard, Kansas]].\n\nSpargo conceived of the SDL as a group akin to the [[Independent Labour Party]] in England and sought to involve it in a broader pro-war organization analogous to the British Labour Party. Spargo himself conceived of this broader group, the [[National Party (United States)|National Party]], and sat on the Executive Committee of this new political organization. The National Party dissolved following disappointing returns in the elections of 1918.\n \nBy the middle 1920s, Spargo had turned away from leftist politics, developing his own theories of what he called \"socialized [[individualism]]\". He became a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], supported [[Calvin Coolidge]] in the election of 1924, and was regarded as a prospective [[United States Secretary of Labor]] during the presidency of [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 2.</ref> His biographer characterized the change as that from a \"Marxian socialist who became a [[Goldwater]] Republican and was throughout an American anti-communist.<ref>Ruotsila, ''John Spargo and American Socialism,'' pg. 3.</ref>\n\nSpargo became the director-curator of the [[Bennington, Vermont]] Historical Museum and wrote several books on [[ceramic]]s.\n\nHe researched and wrote a booklet on the history of his family name.  Spargo is also the name of the locality around [[Church of Saint Laud|Mabe Church]] in the parish of [[Mabe, Cornwall|Mabe]].  He postulated that evidence supported the place name and Spargo family name being in existence c. 400AD.  This pre-dated the arrival by some 400 years of the Christian Church.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n===The socialist years===\n* ''Forces That Make For Socialism in America''.

Graduates of the university's colonial predecessor, King's College, included such notable early American judicial figures as [[John Jay]], who would later become the first [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] of the United States. Columbia College appointed its first professor of law, [[James Kent]], in 1793. The lectures of Chancellor Kent in the course of four years had developed into the first two volumes of his Commentaries, the second volume being published November 1827. Kent did not, however, succeed in establishing a law school or department in the College. Thus, the formal instruction of law as a course of study did not commence until the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\">Theodore W. Dwight, \"Columbia College Law School, New York,\" 1 Green Bag 141 (1889)</ref>\n\n===Theodore Dwight and the founding of the law school===\n\nThe Columbia College Law School, as it was then officially called, was founded in 1858.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>  The first law school building was a [[Gothic Revival]] structure located on Columbia's [[Madison Avenue]] campus. Thereafter, the college became Columbia University and moved north to the neighborhood of [[Morningside Heights]]. As Columbia Law Professor [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] observed, at its founding the demand for a formal course of study in law was still speculative:\n\n<blockquote>It was considered at that time mainly as an experiment. No institution resembling a law school had ever existed in New York. Most of the leading lawyers had obtained their training in offices or by private reading, and were highly skeptical as to the possibility of securing competent legal knowledge by means of professional schools. Legal education was, however, at a very low ebb. The clerks in the law offices were left almost wholly to themselves. Frequently they were not even acquainted with the lawyers with whom, by a convenient fiction, they were supposed to be studying. Examinations for admission to the bar were held by committees appointed by the courts, who, where they inquired at all, sought for the most part to ascertain the knowledge of the candidate of petty details of practice. In general, the examinations were purely perfunctory. A politician of influence was not readily turned away. Few studied law as a science; many followed it as a trade or as a convenient ladder whereby to rise in a political career.\"<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Columbia law madison.gif|thumb|The Gothic Revival Law Library on Columbia's Madison Avenue Campus]]\n\nIndeed, Columbia Law School was one of the few law schools established in the United States before the Civil War. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks, were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was fortunate to have attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the classroom with regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/index.html |title=Early History of Columbia College Law School |publisher=Library.law.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt its founding, four distinct courses of lectures of this class were then established: one on Philology, offered by distinguished scholar and statesman, George P. Marsh; a second by Dr. Francis Lieber, a standard writer upon topics of political science and of international law, then a professor at Columbia College; a third course on Ethics, by Professor Nairne, also of the College; and a fourth on Municipal Law, by Theodore W. Dwight, then Professor of Law in Hamilton College, New York, which at the time already had a flourishing law school.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>  The original course of study to obtain a degree consisted of just two years, rather than the modern standard of three.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/> The first lecture in the law school was delivered on Monday, Nov 1, 1858, by Mr. Dwight, at the rooms of the Historical Society. It was an introductory lecture, afterwards printed. The audience consisted mainly of lawyers. It was plain that many of them could be counted upon as friends of a system of legal education. The result was an immediate attendance of thirty-five students, who showed their intention of pursuing a regular course of study by at once paying a tuition fee for instruction throughout the year. Such assurances were given of a future increase of numbers that it was determined to divide each class at the beginning of the coming year into two sections, for their convenience. The next year, the number of students was sixty-two. In the third year there were one hundred and three. Many of these early students were members of the bar.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/> In 1860, in order to stimulate excellence in attainments of the students, a series of annual prizes was established, commencing with $250, and diminishing regularly by $50, until the sum of $100 was reached. These were adjudicated by leading members of the bar upon the combined merits of written answers to printed questions, and of essays upon topics selected by the instructors. None could compete for the prizes except those who had fully completed the two years' course. The questions covered the range of studies for the whole course. Stringent rules were adopted in reference to the answers, so as to secure the absolute fidelity of the candidates in their work.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>\n\n===The Dwight Method===\n\nProfessor Dwight believed a course of legal study should focus on the application of basic legal principles, as learned through the study of legal treatises, coupled with frequent [[moot court]]s which would permit students to demonstrate their proficiency in applying those principles to new legal problems.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\">http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/articles/15AmLaw419-422.pdf</ref>  In this way, Dwight's method of teaching diverged significantly from the \"case method\" which had then been popularized by Dean Langdell of the Harvard Law School which focused on the study of individual cases and the use of inductive reasoning to distill governing legal principles from those case with little time spent on the practical application of those principles.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\"/>\n\n[[File:Theodore W. Dwight cph.3b29639.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDwight believed that his method was superior to the case method because it helped to create trained legal practitioners ready to enter the profession rather than academics more suited to teaching.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\"/> In support of his position, Dwight cited the example of legal study throughout the Western World since the Roman empire: \"It is not out of place in this connection to refer to the chosen methods of acquiring the Roman law, both as sanctioned by great jurists and by imperial authority, after an experience continuing through centuries . . .The Roman jurists had \"cases\" to deal with, precisely as we do. They were not mere legal philosophers, but disposed of practical and \"burning\" questions of their time. They were, however, in the habit of referring back to a legal principle in disposing of a concrete case, and believed that great principles could be so stated as to win the attention of students and give them a solid basis for future detailed acquisitions.\".<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, Dwight's method gave way to the case method which by the turn of the twentieth century had become the standard curriculum at all of the other premier American law schools at Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\"/>  In 1891, in response to Columbia's adoption of the case method, Dwight and a number of Columbia professors left the law school to found [[New York Law School]] in Manhattan's [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\n===Columbia Law in the 20th century===\n\nAfter Dwight's departure, William Albert Keener of [[Harvard Law School]] became dean of the law school from 1891 to 1901 when he was succeeded by George Washington Kirchwey. Future Supreme Court Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] graduated from the law school in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/ag/aghistpage.php?id=51 |title=USDOJ: About DOJ: Attorneys General of the United States 1789 \u2013 Present: Harlan Fiske Stone |publisher=Justice.gov |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> While practicing law in New York, he began lecturing at Columbia Law School in 1899 and joined the faculty as a full professor. He subsequently became dean of the law school in 1910 and held the position until 1923 when he left to join [[Sullivan and Cromwell]] as a partner. Stone became Attorney General of the United States in 1924 and held that Office for almost a year before joining the Supreme Court of the United States as an associate justice.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, the law school soon became known for the development of the [[legal realism]] movement. Among the major realists affiliated with Columbia Law School were [[Karl Llewellyn]], [[Felix S. Cohen]] and [[William O. Douglas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/jd_applicants/aboutcls/ourhistory/beginnings |title=The History &#124; J.D.

Graduates of the university's colonial predecessor, King's College, included such notable early American judicial figures as [[John Jay]], who would later become the first [[Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] of the United States. Columbia College appointed its first professor of law, [[James Kent]], in 1793. The lectures of Chancellor Kent in the course of four years had developed into the first two volumes of his Commentaries, the second volume being published November 1827. Kent did not, however, succeed in establishing a law school or department in the College. Thus, the formal instruction of law as a course of study did not commence until the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\">Theodore W. Dwight, \"Columbia College Law School, New York,\" 1 Green Bag 141 (1889)</ref>\n\n===Theodore Dwight and the founding of the law school===\n\nThe Columbia College Law School, as it was then officially called, was founded in 1858.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>  The first law school building was a [[Gothic Revival]] structure located on Columbia's [[Madison Avenue]] campus. Thereafter, the college became Columbia University and moved north to the neighborhood of [[Morningside Heights]]. As Columbia Law Professor [[Theodore William Dwight|Theodore Dwight]] observed, at its founding the demand for a formal course of study in law was still speculative:\n\n<blockquote>It was considered at that time mainly as an experiment. No institution resembling a law school had ever existed in New York. Most of the leading lawyers had obtained their training in offices or by private reading, and were highly skeptical as to the possibility of securing competent legal knowledge by means of professional schools. Legal education was, however, at a very low ebb. The clerks in the law offices were left almost wholly to themselves. Frequently they were not even acquainted with the lawyers with whom, by a convenient fiction, they were supposed to be studying. Examinations for admission to the bar were held by committees appointed by the courts, who, where they inquired at all, sought for the most part to ascertain the knowledge of the candidate of petty details of practice. In general, the examinations were purely perfunctory. A politician of influence was not readily turned away. Few studied law as a science; many followed it as a trade or as a convenient ladder whereby to rise in a political career.\"<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Columbia law madison.gif|thumb|The Gothic Revival Law Library on Columbia's Madison Avenue Campus]]\n\nIndeed, Columbia Law School was one of the few law schools established in the United States before the Civil War. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks, were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was fortunate to have attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the classroom with regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/index.html |title=Early History of Columbia College Law School |publisher=Library.law.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt its founding, four distinct courses of lectures of this class were then established: one on Philology, offered by distinguished scholar and statesman, George P. Marsh; a second by Dr. Francis Lieber, a standard writer upon topics of political science and of international law, then a professor at Columbia College; a third course on Ethics, by Professor Nairne, also of the College; and a fourth on Municipal Law, by Theodore W. Dwight, then Professor of Law in Hamilton College, New York, which at the time already had a flourishing law school.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>  The original course of study to obtain a degree consisted of just two years, rather than the modern standard of three.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/> The first lecture in the law school was delivered on Monday, Nov 1, 1858, by Mr. Dwight, at the rooms of the Historical Society. It was an introductory lecture, afterwards printed. The audience consisted mainly of lawyers. It was plain that many of them could be counted upon as friends of a system of legal education. The result was an immediate attendance of thirty-five students, who showed their intention of pursuing a regular course of study by at once paying a tuition fee for instruction throughout the year. Such assurances were given of a future increase of numbers that it was determined to divide each class at the beginning of the coming year into two sections, for their convenience. The next year, the number of students was sixty-two. In the third year there were one hundred and three. Many of these early students were members of the bar.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/> In 1860, in order to stimulate excellence in attainments of the students, a series of annual prizes was established, commencing with $250, and diminishing regularly by $50, until the sum of $100 was reached. These were adjudicated by leading members of the bar upon the combined merits of written answers to printed questions, and of essays upon topics selected by the instructors. None could compete for the prizes except those who had fully completed the two years' course. The questions covered the range of studies for the whole course. Stringent rules were adopted in reference to the answers, so as to secure the absolute fidelity of the candidates in their work.<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>\n\n===The Dwight Method===\n\nProfessor Dwight believed a course of legal study should focus on the application of basic legal principles, as learned through the study of legal treatises, coupled with frequent [[moot court]]s which would permit students to demonstrate their proficiency in applying those principles to new legal problems.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\">http://library.law.columbia.edu/EarlyHistoryColumbiaLaw/articles/15AmLaw419-422.pdf</ref>  In this way, Dwight's method of teaching diverged significantly from the \"case method\" which had then been popularized by Dean Langdell of the Harvard Law School which focused on the study of individual cases and the use of inductive reasoning to distill governing legal principles from those case with little time spent on the practical application of those principles.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\"/>\n\n[[File:Theodore W. Dwight cph.3b29639.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDwight believed that his method was superior to the case method because it helped to create trained legal practitioners ready to enter the profession rather than academics more suited to teaching.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\"/> In support of his position, Dwight cited the example of legal study throughout the Western World since the Roman empire: \"It is not out of place in this connection to refer to the chosen methods of acquiring the Roman law, both as sanctioned by great jurists and by imperial authority, after an experience continuing through centuries . . .The Roman jurists had \"cases\" to deal with, precisely as we do. They were not mere legal philosophers, but disposed of practical and \"burning\" questions of their time. They were, however, in the habit of referring back to a legal principle in disposing of a concrete case, and believed that great principles could be so stated as to win the attention of students and give them a solid basis for future detailed acquisitions.\".<ref name=\"Theodore W. Dwight 1889\"/>\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, Dwight's method gave way to the case method which by the turn of the twentieth century had become the standard curriculum at all of the other premier American law schools at Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"library.law.columbia.edu\"/>  In 1891, in response to Columbia's adoption of the case method, Dwight and a number of Columbia professors left the law school to found [[New York Law School]] in Manhattan's [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\n===Columbia Law in the 20th century===\n\nAfter Dwight's departure, William Albert Keener of [[Harvard Law School]] became dean of the law school from 1891 to 1901 when he was succeeded by George Washington Kirchwey. Future Supreme Court Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] graduated from the law school in 1898.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/ag/aghistpage.php?id=51 |title=USDOJ: About DOJ: Attorneys General of the United States 1789 \u2013 Present: Harlan Fiske Stone |publisher=Justice.gov |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> While practicing law in New York, he began lecturing at Columbia Law School in 1899 and joined the faculty as a full professor. He subsequently became dean of the law school in 1910 and held the position until 1923 when he left to join [[Sullivan and Cromwell]] as a partner. Stone became Attorney General of the United States in 1924 and held that Office for almost a year before joining the Supreme Court of the United States as an associate justice.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, the law school soon became known for the development of the [[legal realism]] movement.

One of the building's defining features is its frontal sculpture, ''Bellerophon Taming Pegasus'', designed by [[Jacques Lipchitz]], symbolizing man's struggle over (his own) wild side/unreason.\n\nIn 1996, the law school was given an extensive renovation and expansion by Polshek Partnership (now Ennead Architects), including the addition of a new entrance fa\u00e7ade and three story skylit lobby, as well as the expansion of existing space to include an upper level students' commons, lounge areas, and a caf\u00e9. In the summer of 2008, construction of a new floor in Jerome Greene Hall was completed providing 38 new faculty offices. Other Columbia Law School buildings include William and June Warren Hall, the Jerome Greene Annex (which Jerome Greene's representatives politely declined to have renamed after the building of Jerome Greene Hall), and William C. Warren Hall (or \"Little Warren\").\n\nLenfest Hall, the law school's premier residence, opened in August 2003. The hall was named for [[H. F. Lenfest]] '58 and his wife Marguerite. Lenfest contains more than 200 luxury student residences, including private studio apartments and one-bedroom apartments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.law.columbia.edu/lenfest/htmls/ |title=Lenfest Hall - Columbia Law School |publisher=.law.columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521225401/http://www2.law.columbia.edu/lenfest/htmls/ |archivedate=May 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  In addition to Lenfest Hall, the majority of Columbia Law students live in the university's Graduate Student Housing consisting of single and shared apartments in buildings throughout Morningside Heights.

Other languages and countries have their own terms for moonshine (see ''[[Moonshine by country]]'').\n\n==Moonshine stills==\nMoonshine stills are illegal to sell, import, and own, in most countries without permission. However, guides are often written by home brewing enthusiasts published on local brewery forums that explains where cheap equipment can be bought and how to assemble it to a still.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bryggforum.nu/download/spiralbrannaren.pdf}}</ref> To cut down most of the cost, stainless steel vessels are often replaced with plastic (e.g. [[polypropylene]]) vessels that can withstand heat, a concept of the [[#Plastic still|plastic still]].\n\n===Evaporation stills===\n\n====Plastic still====\nA plastic still is a device for [[distillation]] specially adapted for separating [[ethanol]] and [[water]]. Plastic stills can  achieve a vapor alcohol content of 40%. Plastic stills are common for [[homebrewing]] of [[moonshine]] because they are cheap and easy to manufacture. The principle is that a smaller amount of liquid is placed in an open smaller vessel inside a larger one that is closed. The liquid is kept heated by an [[Electric_heating#Immersion_heater|immersion heater]] at about 50 \u00b0 C, which causes it to slowly evaporate and condense on the inner walls of the outer vessel. The condensation that accumulates in the bottom of the vessel can then be diverted directly down through a filter containing [[activated carbon]]. The final product has approximately twice as much alcohol content as the starting liquid and can be distilled several times if stronger distillate is desired. The method is slow, and is not suitable for large-scale production.\n\n===Boiling stills===\n\n====Fractional distillation====\n\n=====Column still=====\n{{main|Column still}}\n[[File:Column still.svg|thumb|left|Legend: <br/>\nA.

Column and cooler consist of a 5 meter long copper tube wound in spiral form. The tube first goes up to act as a simple column, and then down to cool the product. Cookware usually consists of a 30-liter wine bucket in pp plastic. The heat source is typically a 300W dip heater. The spiral burner is popular because despite its simple construction and low manufacturing cost it can provide 95% alcohol.\n\n====Pot still====\n{{main|Pot still}}\n[[File:Pot Still Diagram.jpg|thumb|200px|A diagram showing the metal pot and the condensation coil apparatus]]\n\nA pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or [[still]] used to [[Distillation|distill]] [[flavored liquor]]s such as [[whisky]] or [[cognac]], but not [[rectified spirit]] because they are bad at separating [[Congener (beverages)|congener]]s. Pot stills operate on a [[batch distillation]] basis (as opposed to a [[Coffey still|Coffey]] or column stills which operate on a [[continuous distillation|continuous]] basis). Traditionally constructed from [[copper]], pot stills are made in a range of shapes and sizes depending on the quantity and style of spirit desired.\n\nSpirits distilled in pots is commonly 40% ABV, and top out between 60-80% after multiple distillations.\n\n== Safety ==\nPoorly produced moonshine can be contaminated, mainly from materials used in the construction of the [[still]]. Stills employing [[Radiator (engine cooling)|automotive radiators]] as condensers are particularly dangerous; in some cases, [[glycol]] produced from [[antifreeze (coolant)|antifreeze]] can be a problem. Radiators used as condensers could also contain [[lead]] at the connections to the plumbing.

Other languages and countries have their own terms for moonshine (see ''[[Moonshine by country]]'').\n\n==Moonshine stills==\nMoonshine stills are illegal to sell, import, and own, in most countries without permission. However, guides are often written by home brewing enthusiasts published on local brewery forums that explains where cheap equipment can be bought and how to assemble it to a still.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bryggforum.nu/download/spiralbrannaren.pdf}}</ref> To cut down most of the cost, stainless steel vessels are often replaced with plastic (eg [[polypropylene]]) vessels that can withstand heat, a concept of the [[#Plastic still|plastic still]].\n\n===Evaporation stills===\n\n====Plastic still====\nA plastic still is a device for [[distillation]] specially adapted for separating [[ethanol]] and [[water]]. Plastic stills can  achieve a vapor alcohol content of 40%. Plastic stills are common for [[homebrewing]] of [[moonshine]] because they are cheap and easy to manufacture. The principle is that a smaller amount of liquid is placed in an open smaller vessel inside a larger one that is closed. The liquid is kept heated by an [[Electric_heating#Immersion_heater|immersion heater]] at about 50 \u00b0 C, which causes it to slowly evaporate and condense on the inner walls of the outer vessel. The condensation that accumulates in the bottom of the vessel can then be diverted directly down through a filter containing [[activated carbon]]. The final product has approximately twice as much alcohol content as the starting liquid and can be distilled several times if stronger distillate is desired. The method is slow, and is not suitable for large-scale production.\n\n===Boiling stills===\n\n====Fractional distillation====\n\n=====Column still=====\n{{main|Column still}}\n[[File:Column still.svg|thumb|left|Legend: <br/>\nA.

Column and cooler consist of a 5 meter long copper tube wound in spiral form. The tube first goes up to act as a simple column, and then down to cool the product. Cookware usually consists of a 30 liter wine bucket in pp plastic. The heat source is typically a 300W dip heater. The spiral burner is popular because despite its simple construction and low manufacturing cost it can provide 95% alcohol.\n\n====Pot still====\n{{main|Pot still}}\n[[File:Pot Still Diagram.jpg|thumb|200px|A diagram showing the metal pot and the condensation coil apparatus]]\n\nA pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or [[still]] used to [[Distillation|distill]] [[flavored liquor]]s such as [[whisky]] or [[cognac]], but not [[rectified spirit]] because they are bad at separating [[Congener (beverages)|congener]]s.

After Prohibition ended, the out-of-work drivers kept their skills sharp through organized races, which led to the formation of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ([[NASCAR]]).<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/how-moonshine-bootlegging-gave-rise-nascar-180962014/ | title=How Moonshine Bootlegging Gave Rise to NASCAR | magazine=[[Smithsonian]] | accessdate=4 April 2019 | author=Jennifer Billock}}</ref> Several former \"runners\" became noted drivers in the sport.<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=William J. |last2=Terrill |first2=Thomas E. |title=The American South: A History, Volume II |date=2009 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham, Md. |isbn=978-0-7425-6097-0 |page=625 |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_American_South.html?id=foGTgJkUOTEC&q=bootleg+moonshine}}</ref>\n\n==List of bootlegged distilled drinks==\nThis is a list of [[moonshine by country|moonshine produced in various countries]].
