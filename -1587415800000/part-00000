The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again. YA MA IS WAREHAM!\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.<ref name=\"wtc\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Wareham changed hands several times between the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] soldiers besieging the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]] held the [[Bloody Assizes]], with five rebels being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\">{{harvnb|Ladle|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=35}}</ref> This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next [[Ascension Day]] [[John, King of England|King John]]'s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and [[Hanging|hanged]] together with his son.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\"/>\n\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture]] with red brick and [[Purbeck limestone]], following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]). Both are [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's<ref name=\"Davis 1997 15\"/> and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham [[United Reformed Church]] in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr [[Roman Catholic]] church on Shatters Hill, Wareham [[Methodist]] Church in North St. and the [[Evangelical]] Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the [[First World War]] and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Wareham North Street.JPG|thumb|North St.]]\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area.

The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.<ref name=\"wtc\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Wareham changed hands several times between the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] soldiers besieging the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]] held the [[Bloody Assizes]], with five rebels being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\">{{harvnb|Ladle|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=35}}</ref> This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next [[Ascension Day]] [[John, King of England|King John]]'s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and [[Hanging|hanged]] together with his son.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\"/>\n\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture]] with red brick and [[Purbeck limestone]], following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]). Both are [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's<ref name=\"Davis 1997 15\"/> and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham [[United Reformed Church]] in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr [[Roman Catholic]] church on Shatters Hill, Wareham [[Methodist]] Church in North St. and the [[Evangelical]] Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the [[First World War]] and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Wareham North Street.JPG|thumb|North St.]]\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area.

The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as [[Audenshaw]], [[Mottram-in-Longdendale]], and [[Stalybridge]]. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400&nbsp;established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;118\u2013120.</ref> It was the first [[Turnpike trusts in Greater Manchester|turnpike to be opened in Tameside]], and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction of turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.<ref>Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;121.</ref> Ashton is now served by the [[M60 motorway]], which cuts through the west end of Ashton (Junction 23).\n\n===Canals===\n[[File:Portland Basin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A brick-built warehouse with a canal in the foreground.

The 1790s has been characterised as a period of mania for canal building in England. The first of the three to be built was the [[Ashton Canal]], which was constructed between 1792 and 1797. Connecting Manchester to Ashton-under-Lyne, with a branch to Oldham, it cost about \u00a3170,000 (\u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|170000|1796|r=-6}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;121\u2013122.</ref> The [[Peak Forest Canal]] was constructed from 1794 to 1805, and was originally planned as a branch of the Ashton Canal.

The new railways were quicker and more economical than the canals, and the waterways declined. The Huddersfield Canal was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1844. Along with the Ashton and Peak Forest canals, the Huddersfield Canal was later bought by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;123\u2013124.</ref> The canals remained in use throughout the 19th century on a smaller scale than in their heyday, but by the mid-20th century all commercial traffic had ceased. Following an extended period of closure and dereliction, during which parts of the Huddersfield Canal were filled in or built over, a complete restoration was undertaken and the entire canal reopened in 2001. The three canals are now used for leisure craft and are still maintained and in good condition.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;124\u2013125.</ref>\n[[File:Ashton_station.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The entrance to a train station with a sign saying \"Ashton\" above the entrance|[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station]]]]\n\n===Railways===\n[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station|The present station]] at Ashton was opened by the [[Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway]] (AS&LJR) on 13 April 1846.<ref name=Butt>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=978-1-85260-508-7 |id=R508 |page=20 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=John |authorlink=John Marshall (railway historian) |title=The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, volume 1 |year=1969 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-7153-4352-4 |pages=61, 63 |ref=harv }}</ref> Known originally as ''Ashton'', it was renamed ''Ashton (Charlestown)'' in 1874.<ref name=Butt /> and then ''Ashton-under-Lyne'' on 6 May 1968.<ref name=Butt /> It has regular services on the [[Huddersfield Line]] between Manchester ([[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria]]) and [[Huddersfield]]. \n\nThe town historically had three stations, only one of which remains: Ashton (Charlestown), [[Ashton Park Parade railway station|Park Parade]] (closed 1956) and [[Oldham Road railway station (Ashton-under-Lyne)|Oldham Road]] (closed 1959).

The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as [[Audenshaw]], [[Mottram-in-Longdendale]], and [[Stalybridge]]. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400&nbsp;established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;118\u2013120.</ref> It was the first [[Turnpike trusts in Greater Manchester|turnpike to be opened in Tameside]], and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction of turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.<ref>Nevell (1993), p.&nbsp;121.</ref> Ashton is now served by the [[M60 motorway]], which cuts through the west end of Ashton (Junction 23).\n\n===Canals===\n[[File:Portland Basin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A brick-built warehouse with a canal in the foreground.

The 1790s has been characterised as a period of mania for canal building in England. The first of the three to be built was the [[Ashton Canal]], which was constructed between 1792 and 1797. Connecting Manchester to Ashton-under-Lyne, with a branch to Oldham, it cost about \u00a3170,000 (\u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|170000|1796|r=-6}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;121\u2013122.</ref> The [[Peak Forest Canal]] was constructed from 1794 to 1805, and was originally planned as a branch of the Ashton Canal.

The new railways were quicker and more economical than the canals, and the waterways declined. The Huddersfield Canal was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1844. Along with the Ashton and Peak Forest canals, the Huddersfield Canal was later bought by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;123\u2013124.</ref> The canals remained in use throughout the 19th century on a smaller scale than in their heyday, but by the mid-20th century all commercial traffic had ceased. Following an extended period of closure and dereliction, during which parts of the Huddersfield Canal were filled in or built over, a complete restoration was undertaken and the entire canal reopened in 2001. The three canals are now used for leisure craft and are still maintained and in good condition.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;124\u2013125.</ref>\n[[File:Ashton_station.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The entrance to a train station with a sign saying \"Ashton\" above the entrance|[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station]]]]\n\n===Railways===\n[[Ashton-under-Lyne railway station|The present station]] at Ashton was opened by the [[Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway]] (AS&LJR) on 13 April 1846.<ref name=Butt>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=978-1-85260-508-7 |id=R508 |page=20 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=John |authorlink=John Marshall (railway historian) |title=The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, volume 1 |year=1969 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-7153-4352-4 |pages=61, 63 |ref=harv }}</ref> Known originally as ''Ashton'', it was renamed ''Ashton (Charlestown)'' in 1874.<ref name=Butt /> and then ''Ashton-under-Lyne'' on 6 May 1968.<ref name=Butt /> It has regular services on the [[Huddersfield Line]] between Manchester ([[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria]]) and [[Huddersfield]]. \n\nThe town historically had three stations, only one of which remains: Ashton (Charlestown), [[Ashton Park Parade railway station|Park Parade]] (closed 1956) and [[Oldham Road railway station (Ashton-under-Lyne)|Oldham Road]] (closed 1959).

From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply.<ref name=\"Nevell 1993 132\"/> Waste management is now co-ordinated by the [[local authority]] via the [[Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmwda.gov.uk/|title=Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority (GMWDA)|publisher=Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority|year=2008|accessdate=8 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207001553/http://www.gmwda.gov.uk/|archive-date=7 February 2008|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nThe first power station in Tameside was built in 1899, providing power for the area.<ref>Nevell (1993), pp.&nbsp;134\u2013135.</ref> Ashton's [[Distribution Network Operator]] for electricity is [[United Utilities]];<ref name=\"UU\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedutilities.com/?OBH=4188&ID=1419|title=Tameside|publisher=United Utilities|date=17 April 2007|accessdate=19 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716080927/http://www.unitedutilities.com/?OBH=4188&ID=1419|archive-date=16 July 2011|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> there are no power stations in the town.

It was released in October 2008 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] in early 2009, and to [[Linux]] in 2016. A [[Saints Row 2 (mobile)|mobile tie-in version]] was developed by G5 Entertainment and released the same month. The game is the second title and first [[cross-platform]] release in the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' series, following 2006's ''[[Saints Row (video game)|Saints Row]]''. It is succeeded by 2011's ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'' and 2013's ''[[Saints Row IV]]''.\n\nSet in the fictional city of [[Stilwater]] five years<ref name=\"fiveyears\">[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Five+years+have+passed+since+your+former+Saints+crew+betrayed+you.%22 Official Game Description], originally from the Saints Row 2 website, and repeated on numerous store pages</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.saintsrow.com/overview.php| title= Saints Row 2 overview  | accessdate = 26 September 2008}}</ref> after the events of ''Saints Row'', players control the same protagonist and lead a new order of Third Street Saints gang against the three rival gangs occupying their turf and the corrupt Ultor Corporation conglomerate. Players navigate the open world and unlock missions by spending Respect, a currency earned by completing numerous off-mission activities. Two players can [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] progress through the game's story mode and participate in all activities. The player may also compete in 12-player [[deathmatch]]es.\n\nThe developers opted for a more comedic tone to set the game apart from ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', a series featuring common gameplay elements. The game's promotional effort included various public showings, [[special edition]]s and [[downloadable content]] including the ''[[Saints Row 2: Ultor Exposed|Ultor Exposed]]'' and ''[[Saints Row 2: Corporate Warfare|Corporate Warfare]]'' mission packages. Reviews were largely favorable, praising the action and straightforward gameplay, while criticizing technical issues. Reviewers were less receptive to the Windows port, citing worse technical issues. The game had sold around 400,000 units by November 2008, and 3.4 million units by September 2010.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Saints Row 2'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game set in an [[open world]] environment, offering the player a large open environment in which to move around. The player's character is capable of maneuvering through the environment, utilizing weaponry and engaging in [[melee]] combat warfare.<ref name=\"sr2aus\"/><ref name=\"donovan\"/> After successfully completing the first game mission, the player meets the Third Street Saints and begin their devious schemes with the gang. Missions are unlocked by earning 'Respect' points from [[minigame]]s and side-missions<ref name=\"kotaku impressions\"/> and although completing missions is necessary for game progression, players can complete them at their own leisure. The player is granted the option of instantly retrying the missions should they fail an attempt. Numerous [[Continue point|checkpoints]] save progress in each mission, and missions can be replayed from locations within the environment. Aside from attempting missions, the player can explore the environment, purchase items at shops and participate in the aforementioned mini-games and side-missions.<ref name=\"activities trailer\"/>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The player can also wreak havoc upon the city of Stilwater which can provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative forces.<ref name=\"busey sr2\"/> The player can recruit members from a friendly gang and use a mobile phone to contact friends and/or businesses, as well as to input cheat codes.<ref name=\"ukhandson\"/> Entering cheats will disable Xbox 360 achievements.\n\nPlayers drive vehicles that are stolen, bought or unlocked. Aside from automobiles, players can use boats and [[Personal water craft|water craft]],<ref name=\"kotaku details\"/> helicopters,<ref name=\"gary preview\"/> [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and<ref name=\"impressions\"/> motorcycles.<ref name=\"busey sr2\"/><ref name=\"ign first look\"/> A [[cruise control]] system can be activated while using land or sea vehicles.<ref name=\"Auto97-3\"/> [[Waypoint]]s can be placed on the pause-screen map, leaving a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] route between the player character's location and the set destination. Players can hail [[taxicab]] services and pay a fee to quickly navigate the city. By taking land vehicles to [[Mechanic]]s, players can apply paint schemes, [[Car tuning|body mods]], [[hydraulics]] and [[nitrous oxide]].\n\nPlayers create their own character through a system that allows them to modify gender, ethnicity, fitness, voice, face and hairstyle.<ref name=\"gamespot first look\"/><ref name=\"kotaku on sr2\"/><ref name=\"ign details\"/> Walk and fighting styles, and personality traits can be assigned.<ref name = ukhandson/><ref name = \"ign first look\"/><ref name=\"ign details\"/> Players purchase clothes, tattoos and piercings, and set outfits can be bought or created and saved to the player character's wardrobe.<ref name = \"gary preview\"/><ref name=\"sr2 impressions\"/> \"Cribs\" ([[safe house]]s) allow players to withdraw earnings, change outfits, replay missions and save the game.<ref name=\"gamespot first look\"/> Cribs can be customized by applying themes and purchasing objects like TVs and pool tables.<ref name = \"ign first look\"/> Boats and fixed-wing aircraft can be stored at purchased [[dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[hangar]]s. Players select the outfits, vehicles, gestures and graffiti styles used by street members of the Third Street Saints.<ref name=\"tera preview\"/>\n\nThe combat systems from ''Saints Row'' have been updated but many of the basics remain unchanged.<ref name=\"donovan\"/> While engaging in melee-based combat, the player character will perform [[combo (gaming)|combos]] and charge up attacks,<ref name=\"sr2 impressions\"/> and can execute a [[finishing move]] if three consecutive hits are dealt.<ref name = ukhandson/> With a gun equipped, the player can perform a groin attack, and can zoom in for a finer aim [[reticle]].<ref name = \"ign details\"/> The player can also employ the use of human shields,<ref name = ukhandson/> and can use makeshift weapons pulled from the environment e.g. fire hydrants, cement blocks.<ref name=\"gamespot first look\"/> Should the player either commit illegal activities or incite rival gang members, they will provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative figures or rival gangs. The notoriety bar is a visual representation of the proactivity of the opposing figures' response and continual inciting of these groups will bring about a more powerful response, such as [[SWAT]] teams from the police. The player will continue to be chased by these groups until captured or killed and must reduce the notoriety bar by either hiding from the police or gang and wait for it to \"cool off\", or by seeking out a drive-through confessional which will clear the notoriety bar for a small fee.<ref name=\"busey sr2\"/> Should the player character be apprehended or killed, a small percentage of the player's earnings will be removed and the player will [[respawn]] at law or healthcare institutions. The game contains over forty different weapons, many of which have been recycled from ''Saints Row''. The game allows the player to utilise new weapon types, examples of which include [[satchel charge]]s, [[laser guidance|laser-guided]] rocket launchers, chainsaws and more.<ref name=\"weaponsvehicles trailer\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-4\"/> The player has the ability to [[dual wield]] handguns and submachine guns. Weaponry can be purchased by the player from specific stores or unlocked throughout in-game progress.<ref name = impressions/>\n\n=== Open world ===\nPlayers navigate the [[open world]], fictional city of [[Stilwater]]. The city consists of forty-five neighborhoods divided between twenty districts. It is expanded from ''Saints Row''<nowiki />'s version of Stilwater, roughly one-and-a-half times as big and featuring new districts such as the prison, nuclear power plant, and expanded airport among others.<ref name=\"ign details\" /> Game developers stated that the city has very much been redeveloped and each individual neighborhood has been touched up in one way or another.<ref name=\"wp interview\"/> According to the storyline, the in-game corporation Ultor spent more than three-hundred million dollars redeveloping the city,<ref name=\"ign details\" /> funding the police force and, as it states, turning the \"once crime-ridden third-tier city\" into an \"urban utopia\". The Saints Row district is a more notable change within the city, having been completely redesigned and serving as the location of Ultor's headquarters; a towering [[skyscraper]] referred to as the Phillips Building.<ref name=\"ge interview\"/> Many old districts from the earlier revision of Stilwater have also seen changes. Examples include the expansion taken place on the Suburbs district, which is double the size of its depiction in ''Saints Row'' and the Museum district, which features the Eramenos [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] museum exhibit, complete with models of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and [[Theatre of Dionysus]].<ref name=\"saints row 2\"/> There are also several completely new districts, such as the Marina and the University.<ref name=\"wp interview\" />\n\nFrom the beginning of the game, the map of Stilwater is fully visible. However, shops and activities will simply be displayed as a question mark until the player discovers them. By completing missions and wiping out enemy strongholds the player gains control of the various neighborhoods the city is split into. There are over 130 interiors within the city, and hidden events can be triggered by some,<ref name=\"kotaku details\" /> including over ninety shops which can be purchased when the player controls each shops' associated territory.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /> The player gets a 10% discount at owned stores and buying an entire chain of departments will mean that the protagonist's face appears on in-game billboard advertisements.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /> The game shares technology with that of ''[[Red Faction: Guerrilla]]'', another Volition-developed game and so certain elements of the environment are fully destructible.<ref name=\"ukhandson\" /> A number of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] are placed within the sandbox, including the pop-out [[Easter Bunny]] which won \"Top Easter Egg of 2008\".<ref name=\"Auto97-5\"/>\n\n===Respect system===\nThe Respect system is a [[Score (game)#Video games|scoring]] system where the player earns Respect points to unlock missions and progress through the storyline. The player can partake in storyline and stronghold missions only after filling up at least one bar of Respect, and Respect points are removed when the player starts a mission. The 'style rank' is a modifier of how much Respect the player can earn; this is increased by purchasing items for the player character. Respect points can be earned in two ways; by progressing through side-missions called Activities and by completing mini-games and stunts called Diversions.<ref name = \"kotaku impressions\"/>\n\nThere are a broad range of Activities and Diversions available for the player to progress through. Many of the game's Activities made appearance in ''Saints Row'' and a variety of new Activities have also been introduced in the game.<ref name=\"activities trailer\"/> Examples include an underground fight club, a parody of the ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' television show known as FUZZ and numerous others.<ref name=\"sr2 impressions\"/><ref name=\"actdiv\"/> Each Activity can be initiated from various locations and plays out over six levels of increasing difficulty. The Activities have been designed to suit solo and co-operative play.<ref name=\"Auto97-6\"/> Most Diversions do not have specific start points. There are numerous Diversions playable in the game, such as acts of [[indecent exposure]], combat and driving stunts, [[car surfing]] and a [[survival horror]] minigame called Zombie Uprising.<ref name=sr2aus/><ref name=\"actdiv\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-7\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-8\"/>\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Saints Row 2'' has various [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] components implemented throughout the game. Through an online network or through [[System Link]]ing, the player can progress through the game with a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] partner.<ref name=\"Auto97-9\"/><ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/> While in co-op mode, both players can explore the city and progress through the game's storyline missions and minigames.<ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/><ref name=\"destructoid mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-10\"/> Both players are rewarded and credited for completion of such activities,<ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-11\"/> and the players can furthermore play against each other in competitive [[metagaming|metagames]].<ref name=\"Auto97-12\"/><ref name=\"ultor ign\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-13\"/> The co-op mode is \"drop-in/drop-out\" and there is no limit as to how far the players can be away from each other.<ref name=\"kotaku details\"/><ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-14\"/>\n\nThe game contains [[multiplayer video game|competitive multiplayer]] modes, supporting between four and twelve players in a match.<ref name=\"gamespot mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-15\"/> There are two standard [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] modes; the free-for-all \"Gangsta Brawl\" mode and its team-based variant, \"Team Gangsta Brawl\".<ref name=\"vg mp\"/> Another mode, known as \"Strong Arm\", puts two teams against each other fighting for control over the neighborhood.<ref name=\"destructoid mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-16\"/> In \"Strong Arm\", the first team to earn $100,000,000 dollars wins and money is earned by competing head-to-head in activities, controlling \"[[Graffiti|tag]] spots\" which serve as bonus modifiers or by eliminating members of the opposing team.<ref name=\"Auto97-18\"/> While in a party, players are free to roam around a lobby.<ref name=\"vg mp\"/><ref name=\"kotaku mp\"/> The player can rank up in multiplayer and displays this by earning various \"badges\" which are displayed next to the player's name.<ref name=\"kotaku mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-19\"/> By ranking up, the player can unlock more expensive clothing for their multiplayer character.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe multiplayer mode on PC and PlayStation 3 was discontinued in May 2014 when [[GameSpy]]'s servers were shut down.<ref name=\"RPS: closure\"/> However, the PC version's multiplayer can still be played via LAN tunneling software such as Evolve or Tunngle and the PS3 version's multiplayer can still be played using [[XLink Kai]]. The Xbox 360 versions of the game were unaffected as they use [[Xbox Live]] for matchmaking.<ref>https://www.saintsrow.com/community/go/thread/view/136773/30254829/Gamespy_shutdown_and_Saints_Row_2</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after the explosion of Alderman Richard Hughes' yacht, the player, who was the sole survivor of the explosion, awakens from a coma in Stilwater's maximum security prison after undergoing extensive plastic surgery.<ref name=\"fiveyears\" /> Carlos Mendoza, the brother of a former 3rd Street Saint, infiltrates the infirmary and helps them escape. As the pair head back to Stilwater, Carlos informs the player about the demise of the Saints: Julius Little went missing, Troy Bradshaw was revealed to have been an undercover cop and became the Chief of Police, and the remaining Saints members were either killed off or sent to prison. Moreover, three new gangs have risen in the Saints' absence and are now dividing up Stilwater: the Brotherhood, an outlaw gang specializing in arms trafficking; the Ronin, a Japanese ''[[bosozoku]]'' gang that runs a network of casinos, porn distribution rings and strip clubs; and the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] gang that supplies most of the city's drugs. Besides the three gangs, the Ultor Corporation, which is looking to put an end to all street crime in Stilwater to raise real estate prices, has also taken over the old Saints Row district and converted it into their own personal financial fiefdom.\n\nAfter rescuing former Saints lieutenant Johnny Gat, who was arrested and is being tried, the player works with him to revive the Saints. They set a new headquarters in an abandoned hotel and recruit high-ranking lieutenants in Carlos, Pierce Washington and Shaundi, whom the player, now the leader of the Saints and known as \"The Boss\", assigns to investigate each of the three rival gangs.\n\nMaero, the leader of the Brotherhood, offers the Boss and Carlos a truce, promising the Saints 20% of Stilwater once they eliminate their rivals, but an insulted Boss refuses and declares war on the Brotherhood. After several attacks on them, including burning part of Maero's face off with toxic waste, the Brotherhood retaliate by kidnapping and fatally injuring Carlos, forcing the Boss to put him out of his misery. As revenge, the Boss abducts Maero's girlfriend Jessica and tricks Maero into killing her by crushing the car she was locked into during a demolition derby. Later, the Boss kills numerous Brotherhood members released after Ultor CEO Dane Vogel, under pressure from Maero, pulled some strings, and steals a Brotherhood weapons shipment that Vogel planned to confiscate. Using the weapons, the Saints lay waste on the Brotherhood at their dockside headquarters, but Maero escapes. The Boss later faces Maero one final time at the Ultor Dome, who tries to have him killed in a demolition derby, but the Boss prevails and kills Maero, ending the Brotherhood.\n\nWorking alongside Shaundi, the Boss moves to take down the Sons of Samedi by killing their dealers and destroying their drug products. After Shaundi is kidnapped by Veteran Child, her ex-boyfriend, now a DJ and Sons of Samedi lieutenant, the Boss saves her, killing Veteran Child. Later, the Sons of Samedi's leader, The General, has the Boss drugged while his men assault the Saints' headquarters, but despite this inconvenience, the Boss fends off the attack, and later attacks the gang's drug factory, killing their underboss Mr. Sunshine. After Shaundi and the Boss pose as repair workers and hack the police station's street surveillance cameras to locate the General, the Saints  ambushs of the General's motorcade, where the Boss finally kills the General at the Stilwater Mall, ending the Sons of Samedi.\n\nTo get the Ronin's attention, Pierce, Gat and the Boss rob their most profitable casino. Fearing disgrace from his father Kazuo, Ronin leader Shogo Akuji orders his enforcer Jyunichi to capture Gat's girlfriend Aisha to lure him into a trap, leading to Aisha's dead and Gat being severly injured. After taking Gat to the hospital and killing Jyunichi at a restaurant in retaliation, the Boss receives the location of the Ronin's headquarters from Vogel, who was angered by Kazuo after he cut all ties with Ultor. As a last-ditch effort, Shogo ambushes the Boss and Gat at Aisha's funeral, which results in Gat burying him alive. After a failed attack on the Saints ordered by Kazuo, who survived an assassination attempt at the airport, the Ronin lure the Saints out by attacking Mr. Wong, an old ally of the Boss, at his heritage festival. After rescuing Wong, the Boss beats Kazuo in a sword fight and leaves him to die on a burning boat, wiping out the Ronin.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy the Saints in order to expand Ultor's control over Stilwater. After foiling an attack on the Saints' leadership, the Boss retaliates by destroying a high-security Ultor lab. The company's board of directors try to rein in Vogel, leading to him setting them up and allowing the Boss to kill them. Now the Ultor chairman, Vogel hosts a press conference to denounce the Saints, but is forced to retreat when Gat and the Boss attempt to kill him. Assaulting the Ultor building, the Boss confronts Vogel, who attempts to bargain for his life, but is ultimately killed by the Boss. With Ultor no longer a threat, the Saints settle in with controlling Stillwater once more.\n\n=== Bonus mission ===\nIf the player visits the Stilwater Police Headquarters, they may listen to three [[Telephone tapping|wiretap conversations]] recorded under Troy Bradshaw's authority. According to the recordings, Julius was responsible for planting the bomb on Hughes' yacht that nearly killed the Boss, believing that doing so would allow him to disband the Saints and retire. The Boss contacts former Saints lieutenant Dex, now Head of Security for Ultor, who offers to meet them at the Saints' old base and discuss about turning over Julius. However, when the Boss arrives at the meeting place, he finds Julius instead, before the pair get ambushed by a group of Ultor soldiers sent by Dex. After the Boss and Julius fight off the attackers, they escape by hiding in an abandoned amphitheater, where the Boss shoots Juluis. The latter motivates his actions by claiming that the Saints became no better than the gangs that they had been fighting and that the Boss would have been dead if he hadn't saved him the first time they met. However, the Boss still feels betrayed by Julius and ultimately executes him with a headshot, before leaving.\n\n== Development ==\n\n[[Volition (company)|Volition]] began work on ''Saints Row 2'' in 2005, about a year before ''Saints Row'' was released.<ref name=\"wp interview\"/><ref name=\"ge interview\"/> The sequel was first announced by [[THQ]]'s CEO Brian Farrell in a February 2007 conference call, alongside another six franchise continuations for the 2008 fiscal year.<ref name=\"Auto97-22\" /> Game details began to surface in May 2008 after the first teaser trailer was released and sites like [[IGN]] and ''[[GameSpot]]'' reported on an early version of the game.<ref name=\"Auto97-24\" />\n\nOne of the development team's core goals was to develop an identity for the ''Saints Row'' franchise within the open world genre.<ref name=\"behind scenes\" /> The series was known as a \"[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' clone]]\" based on its first release's similarities to the open world sandbox game ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''.<ref name=\"Polygon: Volition\"/> Accordingly, ''Saints Row 2'' was compared to the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]] ''series' own upcoming sequel, ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.<ref name=\"Auto97-31\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-32\" /> When questioned about the two sequels' close release dates, lead producer Greg Donovan responded that they thought their game could compete, that he saw the ''Grand Theft Auto'' sequel moving \"in a more realistic direction\",<ref name=\"Auto97-33\" /> and that there was \"room for more than just one game\" in the open world genre as \"a very different experience than what ... other games are looking to do\".<ref name=\"donovan\" /> The team took an \"over-the-top\" design approach, with cartoonish pastiche and \"wild and outrageous\" gameplay.<ref name=\"afterthoughts\" /> Many early game elements were considered too crass to be included in the final release.<ref name=\"afterthoughts\" />\n\nMany of the original ''Saints Row'' developers continued onto the sequel's team. Thus, the team worked from their lessons learned rather than starting anew. The two games were consequently similar in design.<ref name=\"q&a feature\" /> They overhauled the game engine to enhance the sequel's graphics,<ref name=\"sr2qa\" /> and added contrast and higher-quality textures to make the city setting of Stilwater more realistic.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /> Visual enhancements were also applied to people, cars, explosions, lighting, shadows, and the weather system.<ref name=\"sr2qa\" /><ref name=\"tera preview\" /> A central design goal was to \"create a world that exists independent of the player\" that featured more realistic [[non-player character]]s (NPCs)<ref name=\"Auto97-30\" /> that would smoke cigarettes, use cellphones, drink coffee, open umbrellas when it rained, and physically interact. The original game's engine could not support proximity NPC interaction like sitting together or cuddling.<ref name=\"lifedev\" /> As the city design finalized late in development, the team laboriously hand-placed 20,000 nodes throughout the game world that trigger NPC actions.<ref name=\"lifedev\" />\n\nThe ''Saints Row ''series narrative was conceived as a three-part story, with ''Saints Row 2'' as the second of the three.<ref name=\"sr3interview\" /> While the developers continued the story of the original game, they sought to accommodate newcomers to the series.<ref name=\"wp interview\" /> The final script had roughly 80,000 lines of dialogue, twice that of ''Saints Row''<nowiki/>'s.<ref name=\"lifedev\" /> The story drew strong cinematic influence from [[Quentin Tarantino]] films ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''<ref name=\"sr2qa\" /> and ''[[Kill Bill]]''.<ref name=\"sr2story\" /> While the script was written to follow \"a path of betrayal, revenge and redemption\", the game retains ''Saints Row''{{'}}s light humor,<ref name=\"sr2story-gamespot\" /> with the \"over-the-top, socially distorted\" narrative juxtaposed with dark, gritty moments.<ref name=\"sr2story\" /> ''Saints Row''<nowiki/>'s silent protagonist speaks in ''Saints Row 2'', granting the protagonist more personality and improving the storytelling, according to James Tsai, one of the lead designers.<ref name=\"sr2story\" /> They sought to heavily stylize the game's characters and assign them unique personality traits.<ref name=\"msxbox interview\" /><ref name=\"wp interview\" /> The basic character designs followed naturally from the story Volition wanted to tell, but the characters' personalities and mannerisms were mainly a product of the voice acting performances, where the actors had freedom to interpret and develop their characters.<ref name=\"wp interview\" /> The game's voice actors include film and television stars such as [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[Jay Mohr]], [[Keith David]], and [[Eliza Dushku]].<ref name=\"Auto97-34\" />\n\nWhile the first game was released as an [[Xbox 360]] exclusive, Volition expanded the sequel's initial development to the [[PlayStation 3]] platform.<ref name=\"ps3ign\" /> The platform was successful in Europe, where Volition wished to expand. The [[Video game porting|port]] was developed in-house by a team that previously worked on Xbox 360 development. They struggled with the PlayStation 3's [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]] architecture.<ref name=\"Auto97-21\" /> The game was particularly unstable during development, and would crash after several hours of play.<ref name=\"behind scenes\" /> Lead producer Greg Donovan blamed their \"failing to take systems and features to completion\" as programmers fought last-minute bugs, artists lacked time to finalize designs, and consequently, [[playtest]] versions were not ready until late in the development cycle.<ref name=\"behind scenes\" /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki />\n\n=== Soundtrack and audio ===\n\nThe game's soundtrack features about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game radio stations while driving or at home. Station genres include [[alternative rock]], [[reggae]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[1980s in music|1980s pop]], with artists such as [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Opeth]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[The Used]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Paramore]], [[Panic! at the Disco]] and [[Run-D.M.C.]]<ref name=\"ign music\" /><ref name=\"music revealed\" /> The player can create a custom playlist of the licensed tracks to play on a separate station.<ref name=\"music revealed\" /> Lead audio designer Frank Petreikis's budget for licensed music was double that of the previous game so as to secure more prominent tracks.<ref name=\"Auto97-35\"/>\n\nVolition extended the game's over-the-top atmosphere and humor into the radio stations via [[radio advertisements|commercials]].<ref name=\"q&a feature\" /> For example, commercials that promoted Ultor Corporation products served to enhance the player's sense of the corporation's omnipresence in Stilwater.<ref name=\"pump up the volume\"/> The radio commercials were recorded with voice actors in the same room, rather than apart, so as to maximize their group dynamism.<ref name=\"pump up the volume\"/> Many of the in-game commercials went through several drafts and the developers found this writing process to be challenging.<ref name=\"pump up the volume\"/>\n\n== Marketing ==\n\nPrior to its release, ''Saints Row 2'' was heavily marketed and promoted through Internet and television trailers. Volition also ran several fat contests with series-related paraphernalia as prizes. The game's original release date was delayed for marketing considerations.<ref name=\"anniello\"/> The game's first trailer, in March 2008, was presented as a tourism promotion about the Ultor Corporation's role in rebuilding Stilwater.<ref name=\"Auto97-36\" /> A full marketing campaign featuring American [[film actor]] [[Gary Busey]] began the next month.<ref name=\"Auto97-37\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-38\" /> The ''Street Lessons with Uncle Gary'' video series demonstrated particular aspects of gameplay.<ref name=\"Auto97-39\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-40\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-41\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-42\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-43\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-48\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-49\" /> Subsequent trailers over the next several months also highlighted gameplay elements,<ref name=\"Auto97-44\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-45\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-46\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-47\" /> but one made light of ''Grand Theft Auto IV''<nowiki/>'s lack of [[replay value]],<ref name=\"would you rather\" /> and another demonstrated the cooperative mode using characters modeled on the candidates from the [[2008 United States presidential election]].<ref name=\"Auto97-65\" /> A redesigned official website and community network was launched in July 2008,<ref name=\"Auto97-27\" /> and American [[pornographic actor|pornographic actress]] [[Tera Patrick]] was featured in her own marketing campaign for the game.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-50\" />\n\nPromotional contests throughout mid-2008 included \"Pimp Your Crib\"<ref name=\"Auto97-69\" /> and \"Summer of Bling\".<ref name=\"Auto97-70\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-71\" /> Another competition from THQ and ''WorthPlaying'' gave the winner a trip to a San Francisco ''Saints Row 2'' multiplayer event and published their thoughts online.<ref name=\"Auto97-72\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-73\" /> British fashion label Joystick Junkies ran a [[T-shirt]] design competition in September 2008, and the top entry was featured in the game's first downloadable content pack.<ref name=\"Auto97-74\" /><ref name=\"dlc 1 items\" /> Another round of \"Summer of Bling\" awarded the shirts as prizes.<ref name=\"Auto97-75\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-76\" /> The \"Trick Your Pack\" tool launched in September let the player create their own game box art.<ref name=\"Auto97-77\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-78\" /> There were also other promotions and give-aways.<ref name=\"Auto97-80\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-81\" /> At conventions, ''Saints Row 2'' appeared at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], [[THQ]] Gamer's Day, [[Comic-Con International|Comic Con]],<ref name=\"Auto97-82\" /> [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX]], [[GameStop]] Expo,<ref name=\"Auto97-83\" /> and [[Games Convention|Leipzig Games Conventions]]. The game also promoted itself in the [[Myspace]] Music Tour<ref name=\"Auto97-84\" /> and [[Movember|November 2008]], an Australian fundraiser for men's health.<ref name=\"Auto97-85\" /> In November, THQ signed a deal with [[Massive Incorporated]] to include in-game advertisements on their Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 products.<ref name=\"Auto97-86\" /> In-game and online, players can also find movie posters throughout the city that promote upcoming releases.<ref name=\"Auto97-87\" />\n\n== Release ==\nThe game was originally scheduled for release in North America on August 26, 2008,<ref name=\"Auto97-25\" /> but was delayed to October 14<ref name=\"pushback\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-26\" /> both to add final touches and to launch in a more advantageous release window.<ref name=\"anniello\" /> The game released in three different \"Collectors Editions\", each with a copy of the game, a poster, a limited edition art book, and several extras. The ''Saints Row 2'' \"Initiation Pack\", exclusive to Australia and New Zealand, included promotional items such as a pizza box and bullet-shaped [[USB flash drive|USB memory stick]].<ref name=\"Auto97-88\" /> The Russia-exclusive \"Gift - Buka Edition\" also included the bullet-shaped USB stick,<ref name=\"Auto97-91\" /> and the \"Gun Pack\" included a gun-shaped USB stick.<ref name=\"Auto97-89\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-90\" /> A month before the game's release, ''Saints Row 2'' producer Dan Sutton stated in an interview that they \"definitely\" planned to make downloadable content.<ref name=\"sr2 dlc\">{{cite web | url= http://play.tm/interview/21547/dan-sutton-on-saints-row-2/ | title= Saints Row 3 Already in Development | author= Luke Guttridge | access-date= September 28, 2008 | publisher= Play.tm | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080928090330/http://play.tm/interview/21547/dan-sutton-on-saints-row-2/ | archive-date= September 28, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== PC releases ===\nIn June 2008, THQ confirmed that a [[Microsoft Windows]] port of the game was in development.<ref name=\"sr2 pc\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-93\" /> It was developed by the localization team at [[CD Projekt]], the CD Projekt Localisation Centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-worst-pc-ports-at-launch/2900-1517/ |title=The Worst PC Ports At Launch |first=Jimmy |last=Thang |date=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The studio later became known as Porting House,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/70896/saints-row-the-third-pc-version-not-a-port |title=Saints Row: The Third PC version 'not a port' |first=Alice |last=O'Connor |date=November 2, 2011 |website=[[Shacknews]]}}</ref> and has been referred to by Volition as \"CD Projekt Black\" (in parallel to [[CD Projekt Red]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/9480/discussions/0/34095684652866331/#c613936673342907125 |title=Re: I got a question for the makers. |first=Michael |last=Watson |date=September 18, 2014 |website=[[Steam Community]]}}</ref><!-- Michael Watson a.k.a.

It was released in October 2008 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] in early 2009, and to [[Linux]] in 2016. A [[Saints Row 2 (mobile)|mobile tie-in version]] was developed by G5 Entertainment and released the same month. The game is the second title and first [[cross-platform]] release in the ''[[Saints Row (series)|Saints Row]]'' series, following 2006's ''[[Saints Row (video game)|Saints Row]]''. It is succeeded by 2011's ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'' and 2013's ''[[Saints Row IV]]''.\n\nSet in the fictional city of [[Stilwater]] five years<ref name=\"fiveyears\">[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Five+years+have+passed+since+your+former+Saints+crew+betrayed+you.%22 Official Game Description], originally from the Saints Row 2 website, and repeated on numerous store pages</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.saintsrow.com/overview.php| title= Saints Row 2 overview  | accessdate = 26 September 2008}}</ref> after the events of ''Saints Row'', players control the same protagonist and lead a new order of Third Street Saints gang against the three rival gangs occupying their turf and the corrupt Ultor Corporation conglomerate. Players navigate the open world and unlock missions by spending Respect, a currency earned by completing numerous off-mission activities. Two players can [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] progress through the game's story mode and participate in all activities. The player may also compete in 12-player [[deathmatch]]es.\n\nThe developers opted for a more comedic tone to set the game apart from ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', a series featuring common gameplay elements. The game's promotional effort included various public showings, [[special edition]]s and [[downloadable content]] including the ''[[Saints Row 2: Ultor Exposed|Ultor Exposed]]'' and ''[[Saints Row 2: Corporate Warfare|Corporate Warfare]]'' mission packages. Reviews were largely favorable, praising the action and straightforward gameplay, while criticizing technical issues. Reviewers were less receptive to the Windows port, citing worse technical issues. The game had sold around 400,000 units by November 2008, and 3.4 million units by September 2010.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Saints Row 2'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game set in an [[open world]] environment, offering the player a large open environment in which to move around. The player's character is capable of maneuvering through the environment, utilizing weaponry and engaging in [[melee]] combat warfare.<ref name=\"sr2aus\"/><ref name=\"donovan\"/> After successfully completing the first game mission, the player meets the Third Street Saints and begin their devious schemes with the gang. Missions are unlocked by earning 'Respect' points from [[minigame]]s and side-missions<ref name=\"kotaku impressions\"/> and although completing missions is necessary for game progression, players can complete them at their own leisure. The player is granted the option of instantly retrying the missions should they fail an attempt. Numerous [[Continue point|checkpoints]] save progress in each mission, and missions can be replayed from locations within the environment. Aside from attempting missions, the player can explore the environment, purchase items at shops and participate in the aforementioned mini-games and side-missions.<ref name=\"activities trailer\"/>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The player can also wreak havoc upon the city of Stilwater which can provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative forces.<ref name=\"busey sr2\"/> The player can recruit members from a friendly gang and use a mobile phone to contact friends and/or businesses, as well as to input cheat codes.<ref name=\"ukhandson\"/> Entering cheats will disable Xbox 360 achievements.\n\nPlayers drive vehicles that are stolen, bought or unlocked. Aside from automobiles, players can use boats and [[Personal water craft|water craft]],<ref name=\"kotaku details\"/> helicopters,<ref name=\"gary preview\"/> [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and<ref name=\"impressions\"/> motorcycles.<ref name=\"busey sr2\"/><ref name=\"ign first look\"/> A [[cruise control]] system can be activated while using land or sea vehicles.<ref name=\"Auto97-3\"/> [[Waypoint]]s can be placed on the pause-screen map, leaving a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] route between the player character's location and the set destination. Players can hail [[taxicab]] services and pay a fee to quickly navigate the city. By taking land vehicles to [[Mechanic]]s, players can apply paint schemes, [[Car tuning|body mods]], [[hydraulics]] and [[nitrous oxide]].\n\nPlayers create their own character through a system that allows them to modify gender, ethnicity, fitness, voice, face and hairstyle.<ref name=\"gamespot first look\"/><ref name=\"kotaku on sr2\"/><ref name=\"ign details\"/> Walk and fighting styles, and personality traits can be assigned.<ref name = ukhandson/><ref name = \"ign first look\"/><ref name=\"ign details\"/> Players purchase clothes, tattoos and piercings, and set outfits can be bought or created and saved to the player character's wardrobe.<ref name = \"gary preview\"/><ref name=\"sr2 impressions\"/> \"Cribs\" ([[safe house]]s) allow players to withdraw earnings, change outfits, replay missions and save the game.<ref name=\"gamespot first look\"/> Cribs can be customized by applying themes and purchasing objects like TVs and pool tables.<ref name = \"ign first look\"/> Boats and fixed-wing aircraft can be stored at purchased [[dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[hangar]]s. Players select the outfits, vehicles, gestures and graffiti styles used by street members of the Third Street Saints.<ref name=\"tera preview\"/>\n\nThe combat systems from ''Saints Row'' have been updated but many of the basics remain unchanged.<ref name=\"donovan\"/> While engaging in melee-based combat, the player character will perform [[combo (gaming)|combos]] and charge up attacks,<ref name=\"sr2 impressions\"/> and can execute a [[finishing move]] if three consecutive hits are dealt.<ref name = ukhandson/> With a gun equipped, the player can perform a groin attack, and can zoom in for a finer aim [[reticle]].<ref name = \"ign details\"/> The player can also employ the use of human shields,<ref name = ukhandson/> and can use makeshift weapons pulled from the environment e.g. fire hydrants, cement blocks.<ref name=\"gamespot first look\"/> Should the player either commit illegal activities or incite rival gang members, they will provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative figures or rival gangs. The notoriety bar is a visual representation of the proactivity of the opposing figures' response and continual inciting of these groups will bring about a more powerful response, such as [[SWAT]] teams from the police. The player will continue to be chased by these groups until captured or killed and must reduce the notoriety bar by either hiding from the police or gang and wait for it to \"cool off\", or by seeking out a drive-through confessional which will clear the notoriety bar for a small fee.<ref name=\"busey sr2\"/> Should the player character be apprehended or killed, a small percentage of the player's earnings will be removed and the player will [[respawn]] at law or healthcare institutions. The game contains over forty different weapons, many of which have been recycled from ''Saints Row''. The game allows the player to utilise new weapon types, examples of which include [[satchel charge]]s, [[laser guidance|laser-guided]] rocket launchers, chainsaws and more.<ref name=\"weaponsvehicles trailer\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-4\"/> The player has the ability to [[dual wield]] handguns and submachine guns. Weaponry can be purchased by the player from specific stores or unlocked throughout in-game progress.<ref name = impressions/>\n\n=== Open world ===\nPlayers navigate the [[open world]], fictional city of [[Stilwater]]. The city consists of forty-five neighborhoods divided between twenty districts. It is expanded from ''Saints Row''<nowiki />'s version of Stilwater, roughly one-and-a-half times as big and featuring new districts such as the prison, nuclear power plant, and expanded airport among others.<ref name=\"ign details\" /> Game developers stated that the city has very much been redeveloped and each individual neighborhood has been touched up in one way or another.<ref name=\"wp interview\"/> According to the storyline, the in-game corporation Ultor spent more than three-hundred million dollars redeveloping the city,<ref name=\"ign details\" /> funding the police force and, as it states, turning the \"once crime-ridden third-tier city\" into an \"urban utopia\". The Saints Row district is a more notable change within the city, having been completely redesigned and serving as the location of Ultor's headquarters; a towering [[skyscraper]] referred to as the Phillips Building.<ref name=\"ge interview\"/> Many old districts from the earlier revision of Stilwater have also seen changes. Examples include the expansion taken place on the Suburbs district, which is double the size of its depiction in ''Saints Row'' and the Museum district, which features the Eramenos [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] museum exhibit, complete with models of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and [[Theatre of Dionysus]].<ref name=\"saints row 2\"/> There are also several completely new districts, such as the Marina and the University.<ref name=\"wp interview\" />\n\nFrom the beginning of the game, the map of Stilwater is fully visible. However, shops and activities will simply be displayed as a question mark until the player discovers them. By completing missions and wiping out enemy strongholds the player gains control of the various neighborhoods the city is split into. There are over 130 interiors within the city, and hidden events can be triggered by some,<ref name=\"kotaku details\" /> including over ninety shops which can be purchased when the player controls each shops' associated territory.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /> The player gets a 10% discount at owned stores and buying an entire chain of departments will mean that the protagonist's face appears on in-game billboard advertisements.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /> The game shares technology with that of ''[[Red Faction: Guerrilla]]'', another Volition-developed game and so certain elements of the environment are fully destructible.<ref name=\"ukhandson\" /> A number of [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] are placed within the sandbox, including the pop-out [[Easter Bunny]] which won \"Top Easter Egg of 2008\".<ref name=\"Auto97-5\"/>\n\n===Respect system===\nThe Respect system is a [[Score (game)#Video games|scoring]] system where the player earns Respect points to unlock missions and progress through the storyline. The player can partake in storyline and stronghold missions only after filling up at least one bar of Respect, and Respect points are removed when the player starts a mission. The 'style rank' is a modifier of how much Respect the player can earn; this is increased by purchasing items for the player character. Respect points can be earned in two ways; by progressing through side-missions called Activities and by completing mini-games and stunts called Diversions.<ref name = \"kotaku impressions\"/>\n\nThere are a broad range of Activities and Diversions available for the player to progress through. Many of the game's Activities made appearance in ''Saints Row'' and a variety of new Activities have also been introduced in the game.<ref name=\"activities trailer\"/> Examples include an underground fight club, a parody of the ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'' television show known as FUZZ and numerous others.<ref name=\"sr2 impressions\"/><ref name=\"actdiv\"/> Each Activity can be initiated from various locations and plays out over six levels of increasing difficulty. The Activities have been designed to suit solo and co-operative play.<ref name=\"Auto97-6\"/> Most Diversions do not have specific start points. There are numerous Diversions playable in the game, such as acts of [[indecent exposure]], combat and driving stunts, [[car surfing]] and a [[survival horror]] minigame called Zombie Uprising.<ref name=sr2aus/><ref name=\"actdiv\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-7\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-8\"/>\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Saints Row 2'' has various [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] components implemented throughout the game. Through an online network or through [[System Link]]ing, the player can progress through the game with a [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] partner.<ref name=\"Auto97-9\"/><ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/> While in co-op mode, both players can explore the city and progress through the game's storyline missions and minigames.<ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/><ref name=\"destructoid mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-10\"/> Both players are rewarded and credited for completion of such activities,<ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-11\"/> and the players can furthermore play against each other in competitive [[metagaming|metagames]].<ref name=\"Auto97-12\"/><ref name=\"ultor ign\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-13\"/> The co-op mode is \"drop-in/drop-out\" and there is no limit as to how far the players can be away from each other.<ref name=\"kotaku details\"/><ref name=\"gamespot co-op\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-14\"/>\n\nThe game contains [[multiplayer video game|competitive multiplayer]] modes, supporting between four and twelve players in a match.<ref name=\"gamespot mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-15\"/> There are two standard [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] modes; the free-for-all \"Gangsta Brawl\" mode and its team-based variant, \"Team Gangsta Brawl\".<ref name=\"vg mp\"/> Another mode, known as \"Strong Arm\", puts two teams against each other fighting for control over the neighborhood.<ref name=\"destructoid mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-16\"/> In \"Strong Arm\", the first team to earn $100,000,000 dollars wins and money is earned by competing head-to-head in activities, controlling \"[[Graffiti|tag]] spots\" which serve as bonus modifiers or by eliminating members of the opposing team.<ref name=\"Auto97-18\"/> While in a party, players are free to roam around a lobby.<ref name=\"vg mp\"/><ref name=\"kotaku mp\"/> The player can rank up in multiplayer and displays this by earning various \"badges\" which are displayed next to the player's name.<ref name=\"kotaku mp\"/><ref name=\"Auto97-19\"/> By ranking up, the player can unlock more expensive clothing for their multiplayer character.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe multiplayer mode on PC and PlayStation 3 was discontinued in May 2014 when [[GameSpy]]'s servers were shut down.<ref name=\"RPS: closure\"/> However, the PC version's multiplayer can still be played via LAN tunneling software such as Evolve or Tunngle and the PS3 version's multiplayer can still be played using [[XLink Kai]]. The Xbox 360 versions of the game were unaffected as they use [[Xbox Live]] for matchmaking.<ref>https://www.saintsrow.com/community/go/thread/view/136773/30254829/Gamespy_shutdown_and_Saints_Row_2</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after the explosion of Alderman Richard Hughes' yacht, the player, who was the sole survivor of the explosion, awakens from a coma in Stilwater's maximum security prison after undergoing extensive plastic surgery.<ref name=\"fiveyears\" /> Carlos Mendoza, the brother of a former 3rd Street Saint, infiltrates the infirmary and helps them escape. As the pair head back to Stilwater, Carlos informs the player about the demise of the Saints: Julius Little went missing, Troy Bradshaw was revealed to have been an undercover cop and became the Chief of Police, and the remaining Saints members were either killed off or sent to prison. Moreover, three new gangs have risen in the Saints' absence and are now dividing up Stilwater: the Brotherhood, an outlaw gang specializing in arms trafficking; the Ronin, a Japanese ''[[bosozoku]]'' gang that runs a network of casinos, porn distribution rings and strip clubs; and the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] gang that supplies most of the city's drugs. Besides the three gangs, the Ultor Corporation, which is looking to put an end to all street crime in Stilwater to raise real estate prices, has also taken over the old Saints Row district and converted it into their own personal financial fiefdom.\n\nAfter rescuing former Saints lieutenant Johnny Gat, who was arrested and is being tried, the player works with him to revive the Saints. They set a new headquarters in an abandoned hotel and recruit high-ranking lieutenants in Carlos, Pierce Washington and Shaundi, whom the player, now the leader of the Saints and known as \"The Boss\", assigns to investigate each of the three rival gangs.\n\nMaero, the leader of the Brotherhood, offers the Boss and Carlos a truce, promising the Saints 20% of Stilwater once they eliminate their rivals, but an insulted Boss refuses and declares war on the Brotherhood. After several attacks on them, including burning part of Maero's face off with toxic waste, the Brotherhood retaliate by kidnapping and fatally injuring Carlos, forcing the Boss to put him out of his misery. As revenge, the Boss abducts Maero's girlfriend Jessica and tricks Maero into killing her by crushing the car she was locked into during a demolition derby. Later, the Boss kills numerous Brotherhood members released after Ultor CEO Dane Vogel, under pressure from Maero, pulled some strings, and steals a Brotherhood weapons shipment that Vogel planned to confiscate. Using the weapons, the Saints lay waste on the Brotherhood at their dockside headquarters, but Maero escapes. The Boss later faces Maero one final time at the Ultor Dome, who tries to have him killed in a demolition derby, but the Boss prevails and kills Maero, ending the Brotherhood.\n\nWorking alongside Shaundi, the Boss moves to take down the Sons of Samedi by killing their dealers and destroying their drug products. After Shaundi is kidnapped by Veteran Child, her ex-boyfriend, now a DJ and Sons of Samedi lieutenant, the Boss saves her, killing Veteran Child. Later, the Sons of Samedi's leader, The General, has the Boss drugged while his men assault the Saints' headquarters, but despite this inconvenience, the Boss fends off the attack, and later attacks the gang's drug factory, killing their underboss Mr. Sunshine. After Shaundi and the Boss pose as repair workers and hack the police station's street surveillance cameras to locate the General, the Saints  ambushs of the General's motorcade, where the Boss finally kills the General at the Stilwater Mall, ending the Sons of Samedi.\n\nTo get the Ronin's attention, Pierce, Gat and the Boss rob their most profitable casino. Fearing disgrace from his father Kazuo, Ronin leader Shogo Akuji orders his enforcer Jyunichi to capture Gat's girlfriend Aisha to lure him into a trap, leading to Aisha's dead and Gat being severly injured. After taking Gat to the hospital and killing Jyunichi at a restaurant in retaliation, the Boss receives the location of the Ronin's headquarters from Vogel, who was angered by Kazuo after he cut all ties with Ultor. As a last-ditch effort, Shogo ambushes the Boss and Gat at Aisha's funeral, which results in Gat burying him alive. After a failed attack on the Saints ordered by Kazuo, who survived an assassination attempt at the airport, the Ronin lure the Saints out by attacking Mr. Wong, an old ally of the Boss, at his heritage festival. After rescuing Wong, the Boss beats Kazuo in a sword fight and leaves him to die on a burning boat, wiping out the Ronin.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasingly power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy the Saints in order to expand Ultor's control over Stilwater. After foiling an attack on the Saints' leadership, the Boss retaliates by destroying a high-security Ultor lab. The company's board of directors try to rein in Vogel, leading to him setting them up and allowing the Boss to kill them. Now the Ultor chariman, Vogel hosts a press conference to denounce the Saints, but is forced to retreat when Gat and the Boss attempt to kill him. Assaulting the Ultor building, the Boss confronts Vogel, who attempts to bargain for his life, but is ultimately killed by the Boss. With Ultor no longer a threat, the Saints settle in with controlling Stillwater once more.\n\n=== Bonus mission ===\nIf the player visits the Stilwater Police Headquarters, they may listen to three [[Telephone tapping|wiretap conversations]] recorded under Troy Bradshaw's authority. According to the recordings, Julius was responsible for planting the bomb on Hughes' yacht that nearly killed the Boss, believing that doing so would allow him to disband the Saints and retire. The Boss contacts former Saints lieutenant Dex, now Head of Security for Ultor, who offers to meet them at the Saints' old base and discuss about turning over Julius. However, when the Boss arrives at the meeting place, he finds Julius instead, before the pair get ambushed by a group of Ultor soldiers sent by Dex. After the Boss and Julius fight off the attackers, they escape by hiding in an abandoned amphitheater, where the Boss shoots Juluis. The latter motivates his actions by claiming that the Saints became no better than the gangs that they had been fighting and that the Boss would have been dead if he hadn't saved him the first time they met. However, the Boss still feels betrayed by Julius and ultimately executes him with a headshot, before leaving.\n\n== Development ==\n\n[[Volition (company)|Volition]] began work on ''Saints Row 2'' in 2005, about a year before ''Saints Row'' was released.<ref name=\"wp interview\"/><ref name=\"ge interview\"/> The sequel was first announced by [[THQ]]'s CEO Brian Farrell in a February 2007 conference call, alongside another six franchise continuations for the 2008 fiscal year.<ref name=\"Auto97-22\" /> Game details began to surface in May 2008 after the first teaser trailer was released and sites like [[IGN]] and ''[[GameSpot]]'' reported on an early version of the game.<ref name=\"Auto97-24\" />\n\nOne of the development team's core goals was to develop an identity for the ''Saints Row'' franchise within the open world genre.<ref name=\"behind scenes\" /> The series was known as a \"[[Grand Theft Auto clone|''Grand Theft Auto'' clone]]\" based on its first release's similarities to the open world sandbox game ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]''.<ref name=\"Polygon: Volition\"/> Accordingly, ''Saints Row 2'' was compared to the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]] ''series' own upcoming sequel, ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.<ref name=\"Auto97-31\" /><ref name=\"Auto97-32\" /> When questioned about the two sequels' close release dates, lead producer Greg Donovan responded that they thought their game could compete, that he saw the ''Grand Theft Auto'' sequel moving \"in a more realistic direction\",<ref name=\"Auto97-33\" /> and that there was \"room for more than just one game\" in the open world genre as \"a very different experience than what ... other games are looking to do\".<ref name=\"donovan\" /> The team took an \"over-the-top\" design approach, with cartoonish pastiche and \"wild and outrageous\" gameplay.<ref name=\"afterthoughts\" /> Many early game elements were considered too crass to be included in the final release.<ref name=\"afterthoughts\" />\n\nMany of the original ''Saints Row'' developers continued onto the sequel's team. Thus, the team worked from their lessons learned rather than starting anew. The two games were consequently similar in design.<ref name=\"q&a feature\" /> They overhauled the game engine to enhance the sequel's graphics,<ref name=\"sr2qa\" /> and added contrast and higher-quality textures to make the city setting of Stilwater more realistic.<ref name=\"tera preview\" /> Visual enhancements were also applied to people, cars, explosions, lighting, shadows, and the weather system.<ref name=\"sr2qa\" /><ref name=\"tera preview\" /> A central design goal was to \"create a world that exists independent of the player\" that featured more realistic [[non-player character]]s (NPCs)<ref name=\"Auto97-30\" /> that would smoke cigarettes, use cellphones, drink coffee, open umbrellas when it rained, and physically interact. The original game's engine could not support proximity NPC interaction like sitting together or cuddling.<ref name=\"lifedev\" /> As the city design finalized late in development, the team laboriously hand-placed 20,000 nodes throughout the game world that trigger NPC actions.<ref name=\"lifedev\" />\n\nThe ''Saints Row ''series narrative was conceived as a three-part story, with ''Saints Row 2'' as the second of the three.<ref name=\"sr3interview\" /> While the developers continued the story of the original game, they sought to accommodate newcomers to the series.<ref name=\"wp interview\" /> The final script had roughly 80,000 lines of dialogue, twice that of ''Saints Row''<nowiki/>'s.<ref name=\"lifedev\" /> The story drew strong cinematic influence from [[Quentin Tarantino]] films ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''<ref name=\"sr2qa\" /> and ''[[Kill Bill]]''.<ref name=\"sr2story\" /> While the script was written to follow \"a path of betrayal, revenge and redemption\", the game retains ''Saints Row''{{'}}s light humor,<ref name=\"sr2story-gamespot\" /> with the \"over-the-top, socially distorted\" narrative juxtaposed with dark, gritty moments.<ref name=\"sr2story\" /> ''Saints Row''<nowiki/>'s silent protagonist speaks in ''Saints Row 2'', granting the protagonist more personality and improving the storytelling, according to James Tsai, one of the lead designers.<ref name=\"sr2story\" /> They sought to heavily stylize the game's characters and assign them unique personality traits.<ref name=\"msxbox interview\" /><ref name=\"wp interview\" /> The basic character designs followed naturally from the story Volition wanted to tell, but the characters' personalities and mannerisms were mainly a product of the voice acting performances, where the actors had freedom to interpret and develop their characters.<ref name=\"wp interview\" /> The game's voice actors include film and television stars such as [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Michael Dorn]], [[Jay Mohr]], [[Keith David]], and [[Eliza Dushku]].<ref name=\"Auto97-34\" />\n\nWhile the first game was released as an [[Xbox 360]] exclusive, Volition expanded the sequel's initial development to the [[PlayStation 3]] platform.<ref name=\"ps3ign\" /> The platform was successful in Europe, where Volition wished to expand. The [[Video game porting|port]] was developed in-house by a team that previously worked on Xbox 360 development. They struggled with the PlayStation 3's [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell]] architecture.<ref name=\"Auto97-21\" /> The game was particularly unstable during development, and would crash after several hours of play.<ref name=\"behind scenes\" /> Lead producer Greg Donovan blamed their \"failing to take systems and features to completion\" as programmers fought last-minute bugs, artists lacked time to finalize designs, and consequently, [[playtest]] versions were not ready until late in the development cycle.<ref name=\"behind scenes\" /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki /><nowiki />\n\n=== Soundtrack and audio ===\n\nThe game's soundtrack features about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game radio stations while driving or at home.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

The Western Wall is not mentioned at all by Nahmanides (13th century) in his detailed account of the Temple site in 1267 nor in the report of [[Ishtori Haparchi|Estori ha-Parhi]] (14th century).

In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, [[Edward Keith-Roach]], acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible [[modus vivendi]] had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray.\n[[File:Kotel jerusalem.jpg|thumb|upright|The placing of a ''[[Mechitza]]'' similar to the one in the picture was the catalyst for confrontation between the Arabs, Jews and Mandate authorities in 1928.]]\n\nOn September 24, 1928, the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]], British police resorted to removing by force a [[Mechitza|screen]] used to separate men and women at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]], the Chief Rabbi of the ultraorthodox Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter on behalf of his community, the [[Edah HaChareidis]], and [[World Agudath Israel|Agudas Yisroel]] strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]].

The Western Wall is not mentioned at all by Nahmanides (13th century) in his detailed account of the Temple site in 1267 nor in the report of [[Ishtori Haparchi|Estori ha-Parhi]] (14th century). It does not figure even in descriptions of Jerusalem in Jewish sources of the 15th century (e.g., Meshullam of Volterra, [[Obadiah ben Abraham|Obadiah of Bertinoro]], etc.). The name Western Wall, used by Obadiah, refers - as can be inferred from the context - to the southwestern corner of the wall, and there is no hint that there was a place of Jewish worship there. It is only from the 16th century that Jews began praying at the present location and this is clear from the available sources. Thenceforth all literary sources describe it as a place of assembly and prayer for Jews.

According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

It is also called the [[elixir of life]], useful for [[rejuvenation]] and for achieving [[immortality]]; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in [[alchemy]]. The philosophers' stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosophers' stone were known as the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum Opus]] (\"Great Work\").<ref>[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]], ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/frc/frceng01.htm Freemasonry and Catholicism: an exposition and Investigation.'' |publisher=[[Rosicrucian Fellowship]] {{ISBN|0-911274-04-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Antiquity===\nThe earliest known written mention of the philosophers' stone is in the ''Cheirokmeta'' by [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. 300 AD).<ref>Andrew Ede, Lesley B. Cormack. ''A History of Science in Society: from philosophy to utility.'' University of Toronto Press. p .66</ref> Alchemical writers assign a longer history. [[Elias Ashmole]] and the anonymous author of ''Gloria Mundi'' (1620) claim that its history goes back to [[Adam]], who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. This knowledge was said to be passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. The legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the rejected cornerstone described in [[Psalm 118]].<ref>Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book'' [[Princeton University Press]], 1995. p.19</ref>\n\nThe theoretical roots outlining the stone\u2019s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. Alchemists later used the [[classical element]]s, the concept of [[anima mundi]], and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] as analogies for their process.<ref>Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. 2003. p. 29.</ref> According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or [[prima materia]] (first matter), associated with [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. ''Prima materia'' is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosophers' stone. The importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. In the seventeenth century, [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] writes, \"the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things\".<ref>Mark Haeffner. Dictionary of Alchemy: From Maria Prophetessa to Isaac Newton. [[Karnac Books]], 2004. p.211</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nEarly medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Arab empire]]s. Byzantine and [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Arab alchemists]] were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process.<ref name=\"Strohmaier\">{{cite book|chapter=Umara ibn Hamza, Constantine V, and the invention of the elixir|pages=147\u2013150|last1=Strohmaier|first1=Gotthard|title=Hellas im Islam: Interdisziplinare Studien zur Ikonographie, Wissenschaft und Religionsgeschichte|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783447046374}}</ref> The 8th-century [[Muslim]] alchemist [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] ([[Latin]]ized as ''Geber'') analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called ''xerion'' in Greek and ''al-iksir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (from which the word ''[[elixir]]'' is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as ''al-kibrit al-ahmar'', red sulfur) made from a legendary stone\u2014the philosophers' stone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ragai |first1=Jehane |title=The Philosopher's Stone: Alchemy and Chemistry |journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics |date=1992 |volume=12 |pages=58\u201377 |doi=10.2307/521636}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutbatu'l-Hakim|first=E.

A leading opponent was the Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances, stating, \"Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.\"<ref>[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 196-197.</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] is said to have discovered the philosophers' stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by \"transmutation\".<ref>Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd.

Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher's stone.\n\nThe English philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his spiritual testament ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher's Stone when declaring:\n \n{{quote|The smattering I have of the Philosophers stone, (which is something more than the perfect exaltation of gold) hath taught me a great deale of Divinity.|(R.M.Part 1:38)<ref>The Major Works ed C.A.

Called the \"wordless book\", it was a collection of 15 illustrations.\n\n===In Buddhism and Hinduism===\n{{main|Cintamani}}\nThe equivalent of the philosophers' stone in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] is the ''Cintamani''.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non|Gu\u00e9non, Ren\u00e9]] (2004) (1962).

It is also seen carried upon the back of the [[Lung ta]] (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan [[Prayer flag#Symbols and prayers|prayer flags]]. By reciting the [[Dharani]] of Chintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddhas, is able to understand the truth of the Buddhas, and turns afflictions into [[Bodhi]]. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of [[Amitabha]] and his assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.<ref>R. A.

Saint [[Dnyaneshwar|Jnaneshwar]] (1275\u20131296) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher's stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold. The seventh century [[Siddhar]] [[Tirumular|Thirumoolar]] in his classic ''Tirumandhiram'' explains man's path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he declares that the name of God, [[Shiva]] is an alchemical vehicle that turns the body into immortal gold.\n\n==Properties==\nThe most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher's stone diluted in wine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Theophrastus Paracelsus.

The name of \"Stone\" or ''lapis'' itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as [[Priscillian]] (4th century), who stated ''Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus''.<ref>''Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum '' t. XVIII, p. 24, cited by C. G. Jung in ''Roots of Consciousness''.</ref> In some texts it is simply called 'stone', or our stone, or in the case of [[Thomas Norton (alchemist)|Thomas Norton's]] Ordinal, \"oure delycious stone\".<ref>Line 744 in Thomas Norton's The Ordinal of Alchemy by John Rediry. The Early English Text Society no. 272.</ref> The stone was frequently praised and referred to in such terms.\n\nIt needs to be noted that ''philosophorum'' does not mean \"of the philosopher\" or \"the philosopher's\" in the sense of a single philosopher. It means \"of the philosophers\" in the sense of a plurality of philosophers.\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Michael Maier Atalanta Fugiens Emblem 21.jpeg|thumb|Philosopher's stone as pictured in ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' Emblem 21]]\n[[File:The First Key of Basil Valentine.

''Golden Calf''. 17th Century.</ref> The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Anonymous. ''On the Philosophers' Stone''.

Alchemy and Alchemists. p.70</ref> The appearance is expressed geometrically in Michael Maier's ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]''. \"Make of a man and woman a circle; then a quadrangle; out of this a triangle; make again a circle, and you will have the Stone of the Wise.

Columbia University Press, 2009. p.118</ref>\n\n===Interpretations===\nThe various names and attributes assigned to the philosophers' stone has led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source. [[Exoteric]] candidates have been found in metals, plants, rocks, chemical compounds, and bodily products such as hair, urine, and eggs. [[Justus von Liebig]] states that 'it was indispensable that every substance accessible... should be observed and examined'.<ref>John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry'' London: G.

''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge University Press. 2003. p. 16.</ref> Though esoteric and exoteric approaches are sometimes mixed, it is clear that some authors \"are not concerned with material substances but are employing the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressing theological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations\".<ref>Eric John Holmyard. ''Alchemy'' [[Courier Dover Publications]], 1990. p. 16.</ref> New interpretations continue to be developed around [[spagyric]], chemical, and esoteric schools of thought.\n\nThe transmutation mediated by the stone has also been interpreted as a psychological process. [[Idries Shah]] devotes a chapter of his book ''The Sufis'' to providing a detailed analysis of the symbolic significance of alchemical work with the philosopher's stone. His analysis is based in part on a linguistic interpretation through Arabic equivalents of one of the terms for the stone ([[Azoth]]) as well as for sulfur, salt and mercury. <ref name=\"Sufis54\">{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The Sufis|publisher=Octagon Press|origyear=1964|year=1977|location=London, UK|pages=192\u2013205|isbn=0-86304-020-9}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\n{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}\nThe philosophers' stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work.

It is also called the [[elixir of life]], useful for [[rejuvenation]] and for achieving [[immortality]]; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in [[alchemy]]. The philosophers' stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosophers' stone were known as the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum Opus]] (\"Great Work\").<ref>[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]], ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/frc/frceng01.htm Freemasonry and Catholicism: an exposition and Investigation.'' |publisher=[[Rosicrucian Fellowship]] {{ISBN|0-911274-04-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Antiquity===\nThe earliest known written mention of the philosophers' stone is in the ''Cheirokmeta'' by [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. 300 AD).<ref>Andrew Ede, Lesley B. Cormack. ''A History of Science in Society: from philosophy to utility.'' University of Toronto Press. p .66</ref> Alchemical writers assign a longer history. [[Elias Ashmole]] and the anonymous author of ''Gloria Mundi'' (1620) claim that its history goes back to [[Adam]], who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. This knowledge was said to be passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. The legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the rejected cornerstone described in [[Psalm 118]].<ref>Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book'' [[Princeton University Press]], 1995. p.19</ref>\n\nThe theoretical roots outlining the stone\u2019s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. Alchemists later used the [[classical element]]s, the concept of [[anima mundi]], and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] as analogies for their process.<ref>Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. 2003. p. 29.</ref> According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or [[prima materia]] (first matter), associated with [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. ''Prima materia'' is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosophers' stone. The importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. In the seventeenth century, [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] writes, \"the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things\".<ref>Mark Haeffner. Dictionary of Alchemy: From Maria Prophetessa to Isaac Newton. [[Karnac Books]], 2004. p.211</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nEarly medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Arab empire]]s. Byzantine and [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Arab alchemists]] were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process.<ref name=\"Strohmaier\">{{cite book|chapter=Umara ibn Hamza, Constantine V, and the invention of the elixir|pages=147\u2013150|last1=Strohmaier|first1=Gotthard|title=Hellas im Islam: Interdisziplinare Studien zur Ikonographie, Wissenschaft und Religionsgeschichte|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783447046374}}</ref> The 8th-century [[Muslim]] alchemist [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] ([[Latin]]ized as ''Geber'') analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called ''xerion'' in Greek and ''al-iksir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (from which the word ''[[elixir]]'' is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as ''al-kibrit al-ahmar'', red sulfur) made from a legendary stone\u2014the philosophers' stone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ragai |first1=Jehane |title=The Philosopher's Stone: Alchemy and Chemistry |journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics |date=1992 |volume=12 |pages=58\u201377 |doi=10.2307/521636}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutbatu'l-Hakim|first=E.

A leading opponent was the Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances, stating, \"Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.\"<ref>[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 196-197.</ref>\n\nAccording to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] is said to have discovered the philosophers' stone.

Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher's stone.\n\nThe English philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his spiritual testament ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher's Stone when declaring:\n \n{{quote|The smattering I have of the Philosophers stone, (which is something more than the perfect exaltation of gold) hath taught me a great deale of Divinity.|(R.M.Part 1:38)<ref>The Major Works ed C.A.

It is also seen carried upon the back of the [[Lung ta]] (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan [[Prayer flag#Symbols and prayers|prayer flags]]. By reciting the [[Dharani]] of Chintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddhas, is able to understand the truth of the Buddhas, and turns afflictions into [[Bodhi]]. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of [[Amitabha]] and his assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.<ref>R. A.

Saint [[Dnyaneshwar|Jnaneshwar]] (1275\u20131296) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher's stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold. The seventh century [[Siddhar]] [[Tirumular|Thirumoolar]] in his classic ''Tirumandhiram'' explains man's path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he declares that the name of God, [[Shiva]] is an alchemical vehicle that turns the body into immortal gold.\n\n==Properties==\nThe most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher's stone diluted in wine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Theophrastus Paracelsus.

The name of \"Stone\" or ''lapis'' itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as [[Priscillian]] (4th century), who stated ''Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus''.<ref>''Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum '' t. XVIII, p. 24, cited by C. G.

The Early English Text Society no. 272.</ref> The stone was frequently praised and referred to in such terms.\n\nIt needs to be noted that ''philosophorum'' does not mean \"of the philosopher\" or \"the philosopher's\" in the sense of a single philosopher. It means \"of the philosophers\" in the sense of a plurality of philosophers.\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Michael Maier Atalanta Fugiens Emblem 21.jpeg|thumb|Philosopher's stone as pictured in ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' Emblem 21]]\n[[File:The First Key of Basil Valentine.

''Golden Calf''. 17th Century.</ref> The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Anonymous. ''On the Philosophers' Stone''.

Alchemy and Alchemists. p.70</ref> The appearance is expressed geometrically in Michael Maier's ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]''. \"Make of a man and woman a circle; then a quadrangle; out of this a triangle; make again a circle, and you will have the Stone of the Wise.

Columbia University Press, 2009. p.118</ref>\n\n===Interpretations===\nThe various names and attributes assigned to the philosophers' stone has led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source. [[Exoteric]] candidates have been found in metals, plants, rocks, chemical compounds, and bodily products such as hair, urine, and eggs. [[Justus von Liebig]] states that 'it was indispensable that every substance accessible... should be observed and examined'.<ref>John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry'' London: G.

''Alchemy'' [[Courier Dover Publications]], 1990. p. 16.</ref> New interpretations continue to be developed around [[spagyric]], chemical, and esoteric schools of thought.\n\nThe transmutation mediated by the stone has also been interpreted as a psychological process. [[Idries Shah]] devotes a chapter of his book ''The Sufis'' to providing a detailed analysis of the symbolic significance of alchemical work with the philosopher's stone. His analysis is based in part on a linguistic interpretation through Arabic equivalents of one of the terms for the stone ([[Azoth]]) as well as for sulfur, salt and mercury. <ref name=\"Sufis54\">{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The Sufis|publisher=Octagon Press|origyear=1964|year=1977|location=London, UK|pages=192\u2013205|isbn=0-86304-020-9}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\n{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}\nThe philosophers' stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work.

The command is part of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and is the only unified combatant command created by an [[Act of Congress]]. USSOCOM is headquartered at [[MacDill Air Force Base]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida.\n\nThe idea of an American unified special operations command had its origins in the aftermath of [[Operation Eagle Claw]], the disastrous attempted rescue of [[Iran hostage crisis|hostages]] at the [[Den of Espionage|American embassy]] in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[James L. Holloway III]], the retired [[Chief of Naval Operations]], cited lack of [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission.{{r|Adm Holloway bio}} Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many [[Military operation|operations]], from the 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion]] of [[Panama]] to the ongoing [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]].{{r|NYT Bang Panama}}{{r|NYT Regime thought}}\n\nUSSOCOM conducts several covert and clandestine missions, such as [[Direct action (military)|direct action]], [[special reconnaissance]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[foreign internal defense]], [[unconventional warfare]], [[psychological warfare]], [[civil affairs]], and [[counter-narcotics]] operations. Each branch has a Special Operations Command that is unique and capable of running its own operations, but when the different special operations forces need to work together for an operation, USSOCOM becomes the joint component command of the operation, instead of a SOC of a specific branch.{{r|posture statement}}\n\n==History==\nThe unworkable command and control structure of separate U.S. military special operations forces (SOF), which led to the failure of [[Operation Eagle Claw]] in 1980, highlighted the need within the Department of Defense for reform and reorganization. The Army Chief of Staff, General [[Edward C. Meyer|Edward C. \"Shy\" Meyer]], had already helped create the U.S. [[Delta Force]] in 1977.{{r|Delta elite force}} Following Eagle Claw, he called for a further restructuring of special operations capabilities. Although unsuccessful at the joint level, Meyer nevertheless went on to consolidate [[USASOC|Army SOF]] units under the new 1st Special Operations Command in 1982, a significant step to improve the U.S. Army's SOF.\n\n[[File:Barry Goldwater.jpg|thumb|[[Senator Barry Goldwater]], Former Chairman of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]]]\nBy 1983, there was a small but growing sense in the Congress for the need for military reforms. In June, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] (SASC) began a two-year-long study of the Defense Department,  which included an examination of SOF spearheaded by Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] (R-AZ). With concern mounting on [[Capitol Hill]], the Department of Defense created the Joint Special Operations Agency on 1 January 1984; this agency, however, had neither operational nor command authority over any SOF.{{r|BIT}}{{r|hr5109}} The Joint Special Operations Agency thus did little to improve SOF readiness, capabilities, or policies, and therefore was insufficient. Within the Defense Department, there were a few staunch SOF supporters. Noel Koch, Principal Deputy Assistant [[Secretary of Defense]] for International Security Affairs, and his deputy, Lynn Rylander, both advocated SOF reforms.{{r|socomch}}\n\nAt the same time, a few on Capitol Hill were determined to overhaul [[United States Special Operations Forces]]. They included Senators [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA) and [[William Cohen]] (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), the chairman of the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness]]. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem.{{r|socomch}} Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.{{r|BIT}}\n\nIn October 1985, the Senate Armed Services Committee published the results of its two-year review of the U.S. military structure, entitled \"Defense Organization: The Need For Change.\"{{r|S.CON.RES.80}} Mr. James R. Locher III, the principal author of this study, also examined past special operations and speculated on the most likely future threats. This influential document led to the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act|Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986]].{{r|H.R.3622}}{{r|reorg JCS}} By spring 1986, SOF advocates had introduced reform bills in both houses of Congress. On 15 May, Senator Cohen introduced the Senate bill, co-sponsored by Senator Nunn and others, which called for a joint military organization for SOF and the establishment of an office in the Defense Department to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for low-intensity conflict and special operations.{{r|S.2453}} Representative Daniel's proposal went even further\u2014he wanted a national special operations agency headed by a civilian who would bypass the Joint Chiefs and report directly to the Secretary of Defense; this would keep Joint Chiefs and the Services out of the SOF budget process.{{r|hr5109}}\n\nCongress held hearings on the two bills in the summer of 1986. Admiral [[William J. Crowe Jr.]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill\u2014Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform.{{r|socomch}} By most accounts, retired Army Major General [[Richard Scholtes]] gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in [[Operation Urgent Fury|Grenada]], explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.{{r|NYT Taubman}}\n\nBoth the House and Senate passed SOF reform bills, and these went to a conference committee for reconciliation. Senate and House conferees forged a compromise. The bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four-star general for all SOF, an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a coordinating board for low-intensity conflict within the National Security Council, and a new Major Force Program (MFP-11) for SOF (the so-called \"SOF checkbook\").{{r|SOLIC}}{{r|SOF transition Giles}} The final bill, attached as a rider to the 1987 Defense Authorization Act, amended the Goldwater-Nichols Act and was signed into law in October 1986. Congress clearly intended to force DOD and the Administration to face up to the realities of past failures and emerging threats. DOD and the Administration were responsible for implementing the law, and Congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation.{{r|socomch}} The legislation promised to improve SOF in several respects. Once implemented, MFP-11 provided SOF with control over its own resources, better enabling it to modernize the force. Additionally, the law fostered interservice cooperation: a single commander for all SOF promoted interoperability among the forces assigned to the same command. The establishment of a four-star Commander in Chief and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict eventually gave SOF a voice in the highest councils of the Defense Department.{{r|SOLIC}}\n\n[[File:GEN James Lindsay 1986.jpg|thumb|left|[[General James Lindsay]] the first Commander in Chief, Special Operations Command]]\nImplementing the provisions and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One of the first issues to surface was appointing an [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict & Interdependent Capabilities]], whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even increased the number of assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed [[Secretary of the Army]] [[John O. Marsh]] to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador [[Charles Whitehouse]] assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).{{r|NYT Lewis}}\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. [[United States Readiness Command]] (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, did not appear to have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General [[James J. Lindsay|James Lindsay]], had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the [[Secretary of Defense]] that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President [[Ronald Reagan]] approved the establishment of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.{{r|socomch}}\n\n===Operation Earnest Will===\n[[File:MH-60 Blackhawk landing on Hercules.JPG|thumb|MH-60 landing on Hercules]]\nUSSOCOM's first tactical operation involved [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)]] (\"Night Stalkers\") aviators,  SEALs, and [[Special Boat Teams]] (SBT) working together during Operation Earnest Will in September 1987. During [[Operation Earnest Will]], the United States ensured that neutral oil tankers and other merchant ships could safely transit the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. Iranian attacks on tankers prompted [[Kuwait]] to ask the United States in December 1986 to register 11 Kuwaiti tankers as American ships so that they could be escorted by the U.S. Navy. President Reagan agreed to the Kuwaiti request on 10 March 1987, hoping it would deter Iranian attacks.{{r|socomch}} The protection offered by U.S. naval vessels, however, did not stop [[Iran]], which used mines and small boats to harass the convoys steaming to and from Kuwait. In late July 1987, Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen, commander of the Middle East Force, requested NSW assets. Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two SEAL platoons in August.{{r|socomch}} The Middle East Force decided to convert two oil servicing barges, Hercules and Wimbrown VII, into mobile sea bases. The mobile sea bases allowed SOF in the northern [[Persian Gulf]] to thwart clandestine [[Iran]]ian mining and small boat attacks.\n\nOn 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and [[MH-6|Little Birds]] took off from the frigate [[USS Jarrett (FFG-33)|USS ''Jarrett'']] to track an Iranian ship, ''[[Iran Ajr]]''. The Nightstalkers observed ''Iran Ajr'' turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As ''Iran Ajr'''s crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, as well as a logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.{{r|socomch}}\n\n[[File:Operation Nimble Archer DN-SC-88-01042.jpg|thumb|left|One of two [[Iran]]ian oil platforms set ablaze after shelling by American [[destroyers]]]]\nWithin a few days, the Special Operations forces had determined the [[Iran]]ian pattern of activity; the Iranians hid during the day near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night they headed toward the Middle Shoals Buoy, a navigation aid for tankers. With this knowledge, SOF launched three Little Bird helicopters and two patrol craft to the buoy. The Little Bird helicopters arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy. After a short but intense firefight, the helicopters sank all three boats. Three days later, in mid-October, an Iranian Silkworm missile hit the tanker ''[[MV Sea Isle City|Sea Isle City]]'' near the oil terminal outside [[Kuwait City]]. Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the missile attack.{{r|socomch}}{{r|OEWDP}} During [[Operation Nimble Archer]], four [[destroyers]] shelled two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field. After the shelling, a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit planted explosives on one of the platforms to destroy it. The SEALs next boarded and searched a third platform {{convert|2|mi|0}} away. Documents and radios were taken for intelligence purposes.\n\nOn 14 April 1988, {{convert|65|mi|sigfig=2}} east of [[Bahrain]], the frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts '']] hit a mine, blowing an immense hole in its hull.{{r|NHH}} Ten sailors were injured. During [[Operation Praying Mantis]] the U.S. retaliated fiercely, attacking the Iranian frigate ''Sahand'' and oil platforms in the Sirri and Sassan oil fields.{{r|OEWDP}} After U.S. warships bombarded the Sirri platform and set it ablaze, a UH-60 with a SEAL platoon flew toward the platform but was unable to get close enough because of the roaring fire. Secondary explosions soon wrecked the platform.{{r|socomch}} Thereafter, Iranian attacks on neutral ships dropped drastically.  On 18 July, Iran accepted the United Nations cease fire; on 20 August 1988, the Iran\u2013Iraq War ended. The remaining SEALs, patrol boats, and helicopters then returned to the United States.{{r|socomch}} Special operations forces provided critical skills necessary to help CENTCOM gain control of the northern Persian Gulf and balk Iran's small boats and minelayers. The ability to work at night proved vital, because Iranian units used darkness to conceal their actions. Additionally, because of Earnest Will operational requirements, USSOCOM would acquire new weapons systems\u2014the patrol coastal ships and the [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]].{{r|socomch}}\n\n===Somalia===\nSpecial Operations Command first became involved in [[Somalia]] in 1992 as part of [[Operation Provide Relief]]. C-130s circled over Somali airstrips during delivery of relief supplies. Special Forces medics accompanied many relief flights into the airstrips throughout southern Somalia to assess the area. They were the first U.S. soldiers in Somalia, arriving before U.S. forces who supported the expanded relief operations of Restore Hope.{{r|socomch}}{{r|NYT somalia step}}{{r|NYTttt}} The first teams into Somalia were CIA [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary officers with elements of [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]]. They conducted very high risk advanced force operations prior to the entry of the follow on forces. The first casualty of the conflict came from this team and was a Paramilitary officer and former Delta Force operator named [[Larry Freedman]]. Freedman was awarded the [[Intelligence Star]] for ''\"extraordinary heroism\"'' for his actions.{{r|Gup 2000}}\n\nThe earliest missions during [[Operation Restore Hope]] were conducted by Navy SEALs. The SEALs performed several hydro-graphic reconnaissance missions to find suitable landing sites for [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. On 7 December, the SEALs swam into Mogadishu Harbor, where they found suitable landing sites, assessed the area for threats, and concluded that the port could support offloading ships. This was a tough mission because the SEALs swam against a strong current which left many of them overheated and exhausted. Furthermore, they swam through raw sewage in the harbor, which made them sick.{{r|socomch}} When the first SEALs hit the shore the following night, they were surprised to meet members of the news media. The first Marines came ashore soon thereafter, and the press redirected their attention to them. Later, the SEALs provided personal security for [[George H. W. Bush|President George Bush]] during a visit to Somalia.{{r|socomch}}{{r|NYTttt}} In December 1992, Special Forces assets in Kenya moved to Somalia and joined Operation Restore Hope. January 1993, a Special Forces command element deployed to Mogadishu as the Joint Special Operations Forces-Somalia (JSOFOR) that would command and control all special operations for Restore Hope. JSOFOR's mission was to make initial contact with indigenous factions and leaders; provide information for force protection; and provide reports on the area for future relief and security operations. Before redeploying in April, JSOFOR elements drove over {{convert|26000|mi|sigfig=2}}, captured 277 weapons, and destroyed over {{convert|45,320|lb|kg}} of explosives.{{r|socomch}}\n\n[[File:75th Ranger Regiment Bravo Company 3rd Batallion Somalia 1993.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] in Somalia, 1993]]\nIn August 1993, Secretary of Defense [[Les Aspin]] directed the deployment of a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) to Somalia in response to attacks made by General [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]'s supporters upon U.S. and UN forces. The JSOTF, named Task Force (TF)\nRanger, was charged with a mission named [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] to capture Aidid. This was an especially arduous mission, for Aidid had gone underground, after several [[Lockheed AC-130]] air raids and UN assaults on his strongholds.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}}\n\nWhile Marines from the 24th MEU provided an interim QRF (Force Recon Det and helicopters from HMM-263), the task force arrived in the country, and began training exercises. The Marines were asked to take on the Aidid snatch mission, but having the advantage of being in the area for more than two months, decided after mission analysis that the mission was a \"no-go\" due to several factors, centered around the inability to rescue the crew of a downed helicopter (re: the indigenous forces technique of using RPGs against helicopters and blocking the narrow streets in order to restrict the movement of a ground rescue force). This knowledge was not passed on to the Rangers, due to the Marines operating from the USS Wasp and the Rangers remaining on land. TF Ranger was made up of operators from [[Delta Force]], [[75th Ranger Regiment]], [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th SOAR]], SEALs from the [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]], and Air Force special tactics units.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}} During August and September 1993, the task force conducted six missions into [[Mogadishu]], all of which were successes. Although Aidid remained free, the effect of these missions seriously limited his movements.{{r|BoG}}\n\nOn 3 October, TF Ranger launched its seventh mission, this time into Aidid's stronghold the [[Bakara Market]] to capture two of his key lieutenants. The mission was expected to take only one or two hours.{{r|BHD}} Helicopters carried an assault and a ground convoy of security teams launched in the late afternoon from the TF Ranger compound at Mogadishu airport. The TF came under increasingly heavy fire, more intense than during previous missions. The assault team captured 24 Somalis including Aidid's lieutenants and were loading them onto the convoy trucks when a [[UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60 Blackhawk]] was hit by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG).{{r|socomch}}{{r|BoG}} A small element from the security force, as well as an [[MH-6]] assault helicopter and an MH-60 carrying a fifteen-man combat search and rescue (CSAR) team, rushed to the crash site.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}} The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|battle]] became increasingly worse. An RPG struck another MH-60, crashing less than {{convert|1|mi|1}} to the south of the first downed helicopter. The task force faced overwhelming Somali mobs that overran the crash sites, causing a dire situation.{{r|BHD}} A Somali mob overran the second site and, despite a heroic defense, killed everyone except the pilot, whom they took prisoner. Two defenders of this crash site, [[Gary Gordon|Master Sergeant Gary Gordon]] and [[Randy Shughart|Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart]], were posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}} About this time, the mission's quick reaction force (QRF) also tried to reach the second crash site. This force too was pinned by Somali fire and required the fire support of two [[AH-6]] helicopters before it could break contact and make its way back to the base.{{r|socomch}}\n\n[[File:Battle of mogadishu map of city.png|thumb|Map of the main battle sites during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]]]\nThe assault and security elements moved on foot towards the first crash area, passing through heavy fire, and occupied buildings south and southwest of the downed helicopter. They fought to establish defensive positions so as not to be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire, while treating their wounded, and worked to free the pilot's body from the downed helicopter. With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.\n\nReinforcements, consisting of elements from the QRF, [[10th Mountain Division]] soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, [[Pakistan Army]] tanks and [[Malaysian Army|Malaysian]] [[armored personnel carriers]], finally arrived at 1:55&nbsp;am on 4 October. The combined force worked until dawn to free the pilot's body, receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night.{{r|socomch}} All the casualties were loaded onto the armored personnel carriers, and the remainder of the force was left behind and had no choice but to move out on foot.{{r|BHD}} AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement. The main force of the convoy arrived at the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani]] Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6:30&nbsp;am,{{r|BHD}} thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the [[Vietnam War]]. Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded. Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000.{{r|BHD}} Although Task Force Ranger's few missions were successes, the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force's failure to complete their stated mission, capturing [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]].{{r|BHD}} Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994. The withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on March 1995.{{r|socomch}} Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed, USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia. SOF performed reconnaissance and surveillance missions, assisted with humanitarian relief, protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols. Additionally, they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food.{{r|socomch}}{{r|OEWDP}}\n\n===Iraq===\nUSSOCOM's [[10th Special Forces Group]], elements of [[JSOC]] and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked up again and were the first to enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] to defeat [[Ansar Al Islam]] in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the death of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists would have been in the subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the [[Battle of Tora Bora|Tora Bora]] of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.{{r|PoA}}\n\nAt the launch of the [[Iraq War]] dozens of 12-member [[Special Forces]] teams infiltrated southern and western Iraq to hunt for [[Scud]] missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of [[Navy SEALs]] seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast.{{r|NYT Dao}} [[Air Force combat controllers]] flew combat missions in [[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130H Combat Talon IIs]] and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It was a far cry from the [[Persian Gulf war]] of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where [[Army Special Forces]] and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders.{{r|NYTaSOF}} From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the [[Iraqi security forces]].{{r|Kruzel}}{{r|NYT Gordon}}\n\n==Current role==\nUnited States Special Operations Command played a pivotal role in fighting the former [[Taliban]] government in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001{{r|Kozaryn}} and toppling it thereafter, as well as combating the insurgency and capturing [[Saddam Hussein]] in Iraq. USSOCOM in 2004 was developing plans to have an expanded and more complex role in the global campaign against terrorism,{{r|reach of war}} and that role continued to emerge before and after the [[killing of Osama bin Laden]] in Pakistan in 2011.{{r|WP01}}{{r|CP01}} In 2010, \"of about 13,000 Special Operations forces deployed overseas, about 9,000 [were] evenly divided between Iraq and Afghanistan.\"{{r|WP01}}\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\n[[File:Special Forces Medic in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A Special Forces soldier from [[7th Special Forces Group (United States)|7th SFG(A)]] gives an [[Afghan]] boy a coloring book in [[Kandahar Province]] during a meeting with local leaders, 12 September 2002]]\nIn the initial stages of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]], USSOCOM forces linked up with CIA Paramilitary Officers from [[Special Activities Division]] to defeat the Taliban without the need for large-scale conventional forces.{{r|Lehman}} This was one of the biggest successes of the global [[War on Terrorism]].{{r|Time Waller}}\nThese units linked up several times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle happened during [[Operation Anaconda]], the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the [[Shah-i-Kot]] mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen as one of the heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.{{r|Time Anaconda}} The battle on an Afghan mountaintop called [[Takur Ghar]] featured special operations forces from all 4 services and the CIA. Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Air Force Combat Controllers, and Pararescuemen fought against entrenched Al-Qaeda fighters atop a {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain. Subsequently, the entrenched Taliban became targets of every asset in the sky. According to an executive summary, the [[battle of Takur Ghar]] was the most intense firefight American special operators have been involved in since 18 U.S. Army Rangers were killed in [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Mogadishu]], Somalia, in 1993.{{r|Takur Ghar}}{{r|Takur Ghar summary}}{{r|Roberts Ridge}} During [[Operation Red Wings]] on 28 June 2005, four Navy SEALs, pinned down in a firefight, radioed for help. A Chinook helicopter, carrying 16 service members, responded but was shot down. All members of the rescue team and three of four SEALs on the ground died. It was the worst loss of life in Afghanistan since the invasion in 2001. The Navy SEAL [[Marcus Luttrell]] alone survived.{{r|Lone Survivor}}{{r|Sole Survivor}} Team leader [[Michael P.

In every place, Special Operations forces activities are coordinated with the U.S. ambassador and are under the operational control of the four-star regional commander.\"{{r|WP01}}\n\nThe conduct of actions by SOC forces outside of Iraq and Afghan war zones has been the subject of internal U.S. debate, including between representatives of the [[George W.

The United Nations in 2010 also \"questioned the administration's authority under international law to conduct such raids, particularly when they kill innocent civilians.

The command is part of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and is the only unified combatant command created by an [[Act of Congress]]. USSOCOM is headquartered at [[MacDill Air Force Base]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida.\n\nThe idea of an American unified special operations command had its origins in the aftermath of [[Operation Eagle Claw]], the disastrous attempted rescue of [[Iran hostage crisis|hostages]] at the [[Den of Espionage|American embassy]] in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[James L. Holloway III]], the retired [[Chief of Naval Operations]], cited lack of [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission.{{r|Adm Holloway bio}} Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many [[Military operation|operations]], from the 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion]] of [[Panama]] to the ongoing [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]].{{r|NYT Bang Panama}}{{r|NYT Regime thought}}\n\nUSSOCOM conducts several covert and clandestine missions, such as [[Direct action (military)|direct action]], [[special reconnaissance]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[foreign internal defense]], [[unconventional warfare]], [[psychological warfare]], [[civil affairs]], and [[counter-narcotics]] operations. Each branch has a Special Operations Command that is unique and capable of running its own operations, but when the different special operations forces need to work together for an operation, USSOCOM becomes the joint component command of the operation, instead of a SOC of a specific branch.{{r|posture statement}}\n\n==History==\nThe unworkable command and control structure of separate U.S. military special operations forces (SOF), which led to the failure of [[Operation Eagle Claw]] in 1980, highlighted the need within the Department of Defense for reform and reorganization. The Army Chief of Staff, General [[Edward C. Meyer|Edward C. \"Shy\" Meyer]], had already helped create the U.S. [[Delta Force]] in 1977.{{r|Delta elite force}} Following Eagle Claw, he called for a further restructuring of special operations capabilities. Although unsuccessful at the joint level, Meyer nevertheless went on to consolidate [[USASOC|Army SOF]] units under the new 1st Special Operations Command in 1982, a significant step to improve the U.S. Army's SOF.\n\n[[File:Barry Goldwater.jpg|thumb|[[Senator Barry Goldwater]], Former Chairman of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]]]\nBy 1983, there was a small but growing sense in the Congress for the need for military reforms. In June, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] (SASC) began a two-year-long study of the Defense Department,  which included an examination of SOF spearheaded by Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] (R-AZ). With concern mounting on [[Capitol Hill]], the Department of Defense created the Joint Special Operations Agency on 1 January 1984; this agency, however, had neither operational nor command authority over any SOF.{{r|BIT}}{{r|hr5109}} The Joint Special Operations Agency thus did little to improve SOF readiness, capabilities, or policies, and therefore was insufficient. Within the Defense Department, there were a few staunch SOF supporters. Noel Koch, Principal Deputy Assistant [[Secretary of Defense]] for International Security Affairs, and his deputy, Lynn Rylander, both advocated SOF reforms.{{r|socomch}}\n\nAt the same time, a few on Capitol Hill were determined to overhaul [[United States Special Operations Forces]]. They included Senators [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA) and [[William Cohen]] (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), the chairman of the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness]]. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem.{{r|socomch}} Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.{{r|BIT}}\n\nIn October 1985, the Senate Armed Services Committee published the results of its two-year review of the U.S. military structure, entitled \"Defense Organization: The Need For Change.\"{{r|S.CON.RES.80}} Mr. James R. Locher III, the principal author of this study, also examined past special operations and speculated on the most likely future threats. This influential document led to the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act|Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986]].{{r|H.R.3622}}{{r|reorg JCS}} By spring 1986, SOF advocates had introduced reform bills in both houses of Congress. On 15 May, Senator Cohen introduced the Senate bill, co-sponsored by Senator Nunn and others, which called for a joint military organization for SOF and the establishment of an office in the Defense Department to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for low-intensity conflict and special operations.{{r|S.2453}} Representative Daniel's proposal went even further\u2014he wanted a national special operations agency headed by a civilian who would bypass the Joint Chiefs and report directly to the Secretary of Defense; this would keep Joint Chiefs and the Services out of the SOF budget process.{{r|hr5109}}\n\nCongress held hearings on the two bills in the summer of 1986. Admiral [[William J. Crowe Jr.]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill\u2014Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform.{{r|socomch}} By most accounts, retired Army Major General [[Richard Scholtes]] gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in [[Operation Urgent Fury|Grenada]], explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.{{r|NYT Taubman}}\n\nBoth the House and Senate passed SOF reform bills, and these went to a conference committee for reconciliation. Senate and House conferees forged a compromise. The bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four-star general for all SOF, an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a coordinating board for low-intensity conflict within the National Security Council, and a new Major Force Program (MFP-11) for SOF (the so-called \"SOF checkbook\").{{r|SOLIC}}{{r|SOF transition Giles}} The final bill, attached as a rider to the 1987 Defense Authorization Act, amended the Goldwater-Nichols Act and was signed into law in October 1986. Congress clearly intended to force DOD and the Administration to face up to the realities of past failures and emerging threats. DOD and the Administration were responsible for implementing the law, and Congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation.{{r|socomch}} The legislation promised to improve SOF in several respects. Once implemented, MFP-11 provided SOF with control over its own resources, better enabling it to modernize the force. Additionally, the law fostered interservice cooperation: a single commander for all SOF promoted interoperability among the forces assigned to the same command. The establishment of a four-star Commander in Chief and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict eventually gave SOF a voice in the highest councils of the Defense Department.{{r|SOLIC}}\n\n[[File:GEN James Lindsay 1986.jpg|thumb|left|[[General James Lindsay]] the first Commander in Chief, Special Operations Command]]\nImplementing the provisions and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One of the first issues to surface was appointing an [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict & Interdependent Capabilities]], whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even increased the number of assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed [[Secretary of the Army]] [[John O. Marsh]] to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador [[Charles Whitehouse]] assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).{{r|NYT Lewis}}\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. [[United States Readiness Command]] (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, did not appear to have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General [[James J. Lindsay|James Lindsay]], had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the [[Secretary of Defense]] that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President [[Ronald Reagan]] approved the establishment of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.{{r|socomch}}\n\n===Operation Earnest Will===\n[[File:MH-60 Blackhawk landing on Hercules.JPG|thumb|MH-60 landing on Hercules]]\nUSSOCOM's first tactical operation involved [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)]] (\"Night Stalkers\") aviators,  SEALs, and [[Special Boat Teams]] (SBT) working together during Operation Earnest Will in September 1987. During [[Operation Earnest Will]], the United States ensured that neutral oil tankers and other merchant ships could safely transit the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. Iranian attacks on tankers prompted [[Kuwait]] to ask the United States in December 1986 to register 11 Kuwaiti tankers as American ships so that they could be escorted by the U.S. Navy. President Reagan agreed to the Kuwaiti request on 10 March 1987, hoping it would deter Iranian attacks.{{r|socomch}} The protection offered by U.S. naval vessels, however, did not stop [[Iran]], which used mines and small boats to harass the convoys steaming to and from Kuwait. In late July 1987, Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen, commander of the Middle East Force, requested NSW assets. Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two SEAL platoons in August.{{r|socomch}} The Middle East Force decided to convert two oil servicing barges, Hercules and Wimbrown VII, into mobile sea bases. The mobile sea bases allowed SOF in the northern [[Persian Gulf]] to thwart clandestine [[Iran]]ian mining and small boat attacks.\n\nOn 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and [[MH-6|Little Birds]] took off from the frigate [[USS Jarrett (FFG-33)|USS ''Jarrett'']] to track an Iranian ship, ''[[Iran Ajr]]''. The Nightstalkers observed ''Iran Ajr'' turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As ''Iran Ajr'''s crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, as well as a logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.{{r|socomch}}\n\n[[File:Operation Nimble Archer DN-SC-88-01042.jpg|thumb|left|One of two [[Iran]]ian oil platforms set ablaze after shelling by American [[destroyers]]]]\nWithin a few days, the Special Operations forces had determined the [[Iran]]ian pattern of activity; the Iranians hid during the day near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night they headed toward the Middle Shoals Buoy, a navigation aid for tankers. With this knowledge, SOF launched three Little Bird helicopters and two patrol craft to the buoy. The Little Bird helicopters arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy. After a short but intense firefight, the helicopters sank all three boats. Three days later, in mid-October, an Iranian Silkworm missile hit the tanker ''[[MV Sea Isle City|Sea Isle City]]'' near the oil terminal outside [[Kuwait City]]. Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the missile attack.{{r|socomch}}{{r|OEWDP}} During [[Operation Nimble Archer]], four [[destroyers]] shelled two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field. After the shelling, a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit planted explosives on one of the platforms to destroy it. The SEALs next boarded and searched a third platform {{convert|2|mi|0}} away. Documents and radios were taken for intelligence purposes.\n\nOn 14 April 1988, {{convert|65|mi|sigfig=2}} east of [[Bahrain]], the frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts '']] hit a mine, blowing an immense hole in its hull.{{r|NHH}} Ten sailors were injured. During [[Operation Praying Mantis]] the U.S. retaliated fiercely, attacking the Iranian frigate ''Sahand'' and oil platforms in the Sirri and Sassan oil fields.{{r|OEWDP}} After U.S. warships bombarded the Sirri platform and set it ablaze, a UH-60 with a SEAL platoon flew toward the platform but was unable to get close enough because of the roaring fire. Secondary explosions soon wrecked the platform.{{r|socomch}} Thereafter, Iranian attacks on neutral ships dropped drastically.  On 18 July, Iran accepted the United Nations cease fire; on 20 August 1988, the Iran\u2013Iraq War ended. The remaining SEALs, patrol boats, and helicopters then returned to the United States.{{r|socomch}} Special operations forces provided critical skills necessary to help CENTCOM gain control of the northern Persian Gulf and balk Iran's small boats and minelayers. The ability to work at night proved vital, because Iranian units used darkness to conceal their actions. Additionally, because of Earnest Will operational requirements, USSOCOM would acquire new weapons systems\u2014the patrol coastal ships and the [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]].{{r|socomch}}\n\n===Somalia===\nSpecial Operations Command first became involved in [[Somalia]] in 1992 as part of [[Operation Provide Relief]]. C-130s circled over Somali airstrips during delivery of relief supplies. Special Forces medics accompanied many relief flights into the airstrips throughout southern Somalia to assess the area. They were the first U.S. soldiers in Somalia, arriving before U.S. forces who supported the expanded relief operations of Restore Hope.{{r|socomch}}{{r|NYT somalia step}}{{r|NYTttt}} The first teams into Somalia were CIA [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary officers with elements of [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]]. They conducted very high risk advanced force operations prior to the entry of the follow on forces. The first casualty of the conflict came from this team and was a Paramilitary officer and former Delta Force operator named [[Larry Freedman]]. Freedman was awarded the [[Intelligence Star]] for ''\"extraordinary heroism\"'' for his actions.{{r|Gup 2000}}\n\nThe earliest missions during [[Operation Restore Hope]] were conducted by Navy SEALs. The SEALs performed several hydro-graphic reconnaissance missions to find suitable landing sites for [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. On 7 December, the SEALs swam into Mogadishu Harbor, where they found suitable landing sites, assessed the area for threats, and concluded that the port could support offloading ships. This was a tough mission because the SEALs swam against a strong current which left many of them overheated and exhausted. Furthermore, they swam through raw sewage in the harbor, which made them sick.{{r|socomch}} When the first SEALs hit the shore the following night, they were surprised to meet members of the news media. The first Marines came ashore soon thereafter, and the press redirected their attention to them. Later, the SEALs provided personal security for [[George H. W. Bush|President George Bush]] during a visit to Somalia.{{r|socomch}}{{r|NYTttt}} In December 1992, Special Forces assets in Kenya moved to Somalia and joined Operation Restore Hope. January 1993, a Special Forces command element deployed to Mogadishu as the Joint Special Operations Forces-Somalia (JSOFOR) that would command and control all special operations for Restore Hope. JSOFOR's mission was to make initial contact with indigenous factions and leaders; provide information for force protection; and provide reports on the area for future relief and security operations. Before redeploying in April, JSOFOR elements drove over {{convert|26000|mi|sigfig=2}}, captured 277 weapons, and destroyed over {{convert|45,320|lb|kg}} of explosives.{{r|socomch}}\n\n[[File:75th Ranger Regiment Bravo Company 3rd Batallion Somalia 1993.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] in Somalia, 1993]]\nIn August 1993, Secretary of Defense [[Les Aspin]] directed the deployment of a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) to Somalia in response to attacks made by General [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]'s supporters upon U.S. and UN forces. The JSOTF, named Task Force (TF)\nRanger, was charged with a mission named [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] to capture Aidid. This was an especially arduous mission, for Aidid had gone underground, after several [[Lockheed AC-130]] air raids and UN assaults on his strongholds.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}}\n\nWhile Marines from the 24th MEU provided an interim QRF (Force Recon Det and helicopters from HMM-263), the task force arrived in the country, and began training exercises. The Marines were asked to take on the Aidid snatch mission, but having the advantage of being in the area for more than two months, decided after mission analysis that the mission was a \"no-go\" due to several factors, centered around the inability to rescue the crew of a downed helicopter (re: the indigenous forces technique of using RPGs against helicopters and blocking the narrow streets in order to restrict the movement of a ground rescue force). This knowledge was not passed on to the Rangers, due to the Marines operating from the USS Wasp and the Rangers remaining on land. TF Ranger was made up of operators from [[Delta Force]], [[75th Ranger Regiment]], [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th SOAR]], SEALs from the [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]], and Air Force special tactics units.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}} During August and September 1993, the task force conducted six missions into [[Mogadishu]], all of which were successes. Although Aidid remained free, the effect of these missions seriously limited his movements.{{r|BoG}}\n\nOn 3 October, TF Ranger launched its seventh mission, this time into Aidid's stronghold the [[Bakara Market]] to capture two of his key lieutenants. The mission was expected to take only one or two hours.{{r|BHD}} Helicopters carried an assault and a ground convoy of security teams launched in the late afternoon from the TF Ranger compound at Mogadishu airport. The TF came under increasingly heavy fire, more intense than during previous missions. The assault team captured 24 Somalis including Aidid's lieutenants and were loading them onto the convoy trucks when a [[UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60 Blackhawk]] was hit by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG).{{r|socomch}}{{r|BoG}} A small element from the security force, as well as an [[MH-6]] assault helicopter and an MH-60 carrying a fifteen-man combat search and rescue (CSAR) team, rushed to the crash site.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}} The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|battle]] became increasingly worse. An RPG struck another MH-60, crashing less than {{convert|1|mi|1}} to the south of the first downed helicopter. The task force faced overwhelming Somali mobs that overran the crash sites, causing a dire situation.{{r|BHD}} A Somali mob overran the second site and, despite a heroic defense, killed everyone except the pilot, whom they took prisoner. Two defenders of this crash site, [[Gary Gordon|Master Sergeant Gary Gordon]] and [[Randy Shughart|Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart]], were posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}} About this time, the mission's quick reaction force (QRF) also tried to reach the second crash site. This force too was pinned by Somali fire and required the fire support of two [[AH-6]] helicopters before it could break contact and make its way back to the base.{{r|socomch}}\n\n[[File:Battle of mogadishu map of city.png|thumb|Map of the main battle sites during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]]]\nThe assault and security elements moved on foot towards the first crash area, passing through heavy fire, and occupied buildings south and southwest of the downed helicopter. They fought to establish defensive positions so as not to be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire, while treating their wounded, and worked to free the pilot's body from the downed helicopter. With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.\n\nReinforcements, consisting of elements from the QRF, [[10th Mountain Division]] soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, [[Pakistan Army]] tanks and [[Malaysian Army|Malaysian]] [[armored personnel carriers]], finally arrived at 1:55&nbsp;am on 4 October. The combined force worked until dawn to free the pilot's body, receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night.{{r|socomch}} All the casualties were loaded onto the armored personnel carriers, and the remainder of the force was left behind and had no choice but to move out on foot.{{r|BHD}} AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement. The main force of the convoy arrived at the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani]] Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6:30&nbsp;am,{{r|BHD}} thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the [[Vietnam War]]. Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded. Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000.{{r|BHD}} Although Task Force Ranger's few missions were successes, the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force's failure to complete their stated mission, capturing [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]].{{r|BHD}} Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994. The withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on March 1995.{{r|socomch}} Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed, USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia. SOF performed reconnaissance and surveillance missions, assisted with humanitarian relief, protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols. Additionally, they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food.{{r|socomch}}{{r|OEWDP}}\n\n===Iraq===\nUSSOCOM's [[10th Special Forces Group]], elements of [[JSOC]] and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked up again and were the first to enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] to defeat [[Ansar Al Islam]] in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the death of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists would have been in the subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the [[Battle of Tora Bora|Tora Bora]] of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.{{r|PoA}}\n\nAt the launch of the [[Iraq War]] dozens of 12-member [[Special Forces]] teams infiltrated southern and western Iraq to hunt for [[Scud]] missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of [[Navy SEALs]] seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast.{{r|NYT Dao}} [[Air Force combat controllers]] flew combat missions in [[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130H Combat Talon IIs]] and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It was a far cry from the [[Persian Gulf war]] of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines.

The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs from all other military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations, as they strike from and return to the sea. SEALs (SEa, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected. Because of the dangers inherent in their missions, prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training regime in the world.{{r|SEAL website}}{{r|Couch 2001}}\n* [[SEAL Team Six|Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU), referred to as SEAL Team Six, the name of its predecessor which was officially disbanded in 1987.\n* [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams]] are SEAL teams with an added underwater delivery capability who use the SDV MK VIII and the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), submersibles that provides NSW with an unprecedented capability that combines the attributes of clandestine underwater mobility and the combat swimmer.{{r|insert/extract}}{{r|2002 Tiron}}\n* [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen]] (SWCC) operate and maintain state-of-the-art surface craft to conduct coastal patrol and interdiction and support special operations missions.

However, it is likely that the exact nature and roles of digital journalism will not be fully known for some time.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe first type of digital journalism, called [[teletext]], was invented in the UK in 1970. Teletext is a system allowing viewers to choose which stories they wish to read and see it immediately. The information provided through teletext is brief and instant, similar to the information seen in digital journalism today.  {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The information was broadcast between the frames of a television signal in what was called the Vertical Blanking Interval or VBI.\n\nAmerican journalist, Hunter S. Thompson relied on early digital communication technology beginning by using a fax machine to report from the 1971 US presidential campaign trail as documented in his book [[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail]].\n\nAfter the invention of teletext was the invention of [[videotex]], of which [[Prestel]] was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979<ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 36.</ref> with various British newspapers such as the [[Financial Times]] lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. Videotex closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end-user demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Third Wave of Online Journalism|url= http://www.ojr.org/ojr/future/1019174689.php|publisher=ojr.org}}</ref>\n\nAmerican newspaper companies took notice of the new technology and created their own videotex systems, the largest and most ambitious being Viewtron, a service of Knight-Ridder launched in 1981. Others were Keycom in Chicago and Gateway in Los Angeles. All of them had closed by 1986.\n\nNext came computer Bulletin Board Systems. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several smaller newspapers started online news services using BBS software and telephone modems. The first of these was the Albuquerque Tribune in 1989.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in September 1992 [[breaking news|broke the news]] of [[Electronic Arts]]' acquisition of [[Origin Systems]] on [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], before its next issue went to press.<ref name=\"wilson199212\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=101 | title=Anatomy of a Rumor | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1992<!-- -12 --> | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=210}}</ref> Online news websites began to proliferate in the 1990s.  An early adopter was ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] which offered online news as [[Nando]]. Steve Yelvington wrote on the [[Poynter Institute]] website about [[Nando]], owned by The N&O, by saying \"Nando evolved into the first serious, professional [[news site]] on the World Wide Web\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It originated in the early 1990s as \"NandO Land\".  It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, [[Netscape Navigator]] (1994), and [[Internet Explorer]] (1995).<ref name=\"auto4\">Scott 2005, p. 94.</ref> By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty-four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their [[news aggregator]]s (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAlso, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', was founded in 1995.

Some news organizations use the Web exclusively or as a secondary outlet for their content. The [[Online News Association]], founded in 1999, is the largest organization representing online journalists, with more than 1,700 members whose principal livelihood involves gathering or producing news for digital presentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists.org/?page=onamission|title=Online News Association|author=Online News Association|work=journalists.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. Newspapers may lose [[classified advertising]] to websites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography.

People can comment on articles and start discussion boards to discuss articles. Before the Internet, spontaneous discussion between readers who had never met was impossible. The process of discussing a news item is a big portion of what makes for digital journalism.  People add to the story and connect with other people who want to discuss the topic.\n\nDigital journalism creates an opportunity for [[niche audience]]s, allowing people to have more options as to what to view and read.\n\nDigital journalism opens up new ways of storytelling; through the technical components of the new medium, digital journalists can provide a variety of media, such as [[sound|audio]], [[video]], and [[digital photography]].\n\nDigital journalism represents a revolution of how news is consumed by society. Online sources are able to provide quick, efficient, and accurate [[Reporter|reporting]] of breaking news in a matter of seconds, providing society with a synopsis of events as they occur. Throughout the development of the event, journalists are able to feed online sources the information keeping readers up-to-date in mere seconds. The speed in which a story can be posted can affect the accuracy of the reporting in a way that doesn't usually happen in print journalism. Before the emergence of digital journalism the printing process took much more time, allowing for the discovery and correction of errors.\n\nNews consumers must become Web literate and use [[critical thinking]] to evaluate the credibility of sources.  Because it is possible for anyone to write articles and post them on the Internet, the definition of journalism is changing. Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable [[Online newspaper|news websites]], it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the [[Information overload|massive amount of information]] coming in from the digital area of journalism.\n\nThere are great advantages with digital journalism and the new [[blogging]] evolution that people are becoming accustomed to, but there are disadvantages. For instance, people are used to what they already know and can't always catch up quickly with the new technologies in the 21st century. The goals of print and digital journalism are the same, although different tools are needed to function.\n\nThe interaction between the writer and consumer is new, and this can be credited to digital journalism. There are many ways to get personal thoughts on the Web. There are some disadvantages to this, however, the main one being [[Formal verification|factual information]]. There is a pressing need for accuracy in digital journalism, and until they find a way to press accuracy, they will still face some criticism.\n\nOne major dispute regards the credibility of these online news websites. A digital journalism credibility study performed by the [[Online News Association]] compares the online public credibility ratings to actual media respondent credibility ratings. Looking at a variety of online media sources, the study found that overall the public saw online media as more credible than it actually is.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105151127/http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |archive-date=2006-11-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe effects of digital journalism are evident worldwide. This form of journalism has pushed journalists to reform and evolve. Older journalists who are not tech savvy have felt the blunt force of this. In recent months, a number of older journalists have been pushed out and younger journalists brought in because of their lower cost and ability to work in advanced technology settings.\n\n==Impact on publishers==\nMany newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', have created [[Online newspaper|online sites]] to remain competitive and have taken advantage of audio, video, and text linking to remain at the top of news consumers' lists as most of the news enthusiasm now reach their base through hand held devices such as smartphones, tablets etc. Hence audio or video backing is a definite advantage.\n\nNewspapers rarely break news stories any more, with most websites reporting on breaking news before the cable news channels.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Digital journalism allows for reports to start out vague and generalized, and progress to a better story. Newspapers and TV cable are at a disadvantage because they generally can only put together stories when an ample amount of detail and information are available.  Often, newspapers have to wait for the next day, or even two days later if it is a late-breaking story, before being able to publish it. Newspapers lose a lot of ground to their online counterparts, with [[advertising|ad revenue]] shifting to the Internet, and subscription to the printed paper decreasing. People are now able to find the news they want, when they want, without having to leave their homes or pay to receive the news {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, even though there are still people who are willing to pay for online journalistic content.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Himma-Kadakas |first1=Marju |last2=K\u00f5uts |first2=Ragne |title=Who Is Willing to Pay for Online Journalistic Content? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=106 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.345 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/345|year=2015 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nBecause of this, many people have viewed digital journalism as the death of journalism.{{who|date=February 2011}} According to communication scholar Nicole Cohen, \"four practices stand out as putting pressure on traditional journalism production: outsourcing, unpaid labour, metrics and measurement, and automation\".<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nicole S.|date=2015-04-03|title=From Pink Slips to Pink Slime: Transforming Media Labor in a Digital Age|journal=The Communication Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=98\u2013122|doi=10.1080/10714421.2015.1031996|issn=1071-4421}}</ref> Free advertising on websites such as [[Craigslist]] has transformed how people publicize; the Internet has created a faster, cheaper way for people to get news out, thus creating the shift in ad sales from standard newspapers to the Internet.

The growth in digital journalism and the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|near collapse of the economy]] has also led to [[Layoff|downsizing]] for those in the industry.\n\nStudents wishing to become journalists now need to be familiar with digital journalism in order to be able to contribute and develop journalism skills. Not only must a journalist analyze their audience and focus on effective communication with them, they have to be quick; news websites are able to update their stories within minutes of the news event. Other skills may include creating a website and uploading information using basic programming skills.\n\nCritics believe digital journalism has made it easier for individuals who are not qualified journalists to misinform<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ekstr\u00f6m|first=Mats|last2=Lewis|first2=Seth C.|last3=Westlund|first3=Oscar|date=2020-01-20|title=Epistemologies of digital journalism and the study of misinformation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819856914|journal=New Media & Society|language=en-US|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205\u2013212|doi=10.1177/1461444819856914|issn=1461-4448}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ciampaglia|first=Giovanni Luca|last2=Mantzarlis|first2=Alexios|last3=Maus|first3=Gregory|last4=Menczer|first4=Filippo|date=2018-03-27|title=Research Challenges of Digital Misinformation: Toward a Trustworthy Web|url=https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2783|journal=AI Magazine|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=65\u201374|doi=10.1609/aimag.v39i1.2783|issn=2371-9621}}</ref> the general public. Many believe that this form of journalism has created a number of sites that do not have credible information. Sites such as [[Perez Hilton|PerezHilton.com]] have been criticized for blurring the lines between journalism and opinionated writing.\n\nSome critics believe that newspapers should not switch to a solely Internet-based format, but instead keep a component of print as well as digital.\n\nDigital journalism allows citizens and readers the opportunity to join in on [[threaded discussion]]s relating to a news article that has been read by the public. This offers an excellent source for writers and reporters to decide what is important and what should be omitted in the future. These threads can provide useful information to writers of digital journalism so that future articles can be pruned and improved to possibly create a better article the next time around.\n\n== Implications on traditional Journalism ==\n[[Digitizing|Digitization]] is currently causing many changes to traditional journalistic practices. The labor of journalists, in general, is becoming increasingly dependent on digital journalism. Scholars outline that this is a change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the [[Labor process theory|labor process]].<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\">{{Cite journal|last=\u00d6rnebring|first=Henrik|date=2010-02-03|title=Technology and journalism-as-labour: Historical perspectives|journal=Journalism|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=57\u201374|doi=10.1177/1464884909350644}}</ref> They also contend that this is simply the de-skilling of some skills and the up-skilling of others.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> This theory is in contention to the notion that [[technological determinism]] is negatively effecting [[journalism]], as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being [[outsourcing]], [[algorithm]]s, and [[automation]].<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/> Although Cohen believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way.<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/>\n\nThere is also the impact that digital journalism is influencing the uprising of citizen journalism. Because digital journalism takes place online and is contributed mostly by citizens on user-generated content sites, there is competition growing between the two. Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to verify the source of information.\n\n==Work outside traditional press==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet has also given rise to more participation by people who are not normally journalists, such as with Indy Media (Max Perez).\n\n[[Bloggers]] write on [[web logs]] or [[blogs]]. Traditional journalists often do not consider bloggers to automatically be journalists. This has more to do with standards and professional practices than the medium. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding journalism attracts amateur journalists, as well as ambitious professionals that are restrained by the boundaries set by traditional press. However, the implication of these types of journalism is that it disregards the professional norms of journalistic practices that ensures accuracy and impartiality of the content.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Andrea|date=2014-11-24|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272\u2013288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915}}</ref>  But, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, blogging has generally gained at least more attention and has led to some effects on mainstream journalism, such as exposing problems related to a television piece about President [[George W. Bush]]'s National Guard Service.\n\nRecent legal judgements have determined that bloggers are entitled to the same protections as other journalists subject to the same responsibilities. In the United States, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ has been instrumental] in advocating for the [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ rights of journalist bloggers].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=6&doc_id=285455&doc_no=H028579|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|publisher=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that:\"[96] A second preliminary question is what the new defence should be called. In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test. This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style. However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists. These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets. I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is \"available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium\": Jameel, at para. 54.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7837/index.do|title=Grant v. Torstar Corp. - SCC Cases (Lexum)|author=|date=|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}</ref>\n\nOther significant tools of on-line journalism are Internet [[Internet forum|forums]], [[discussion boards]] and [[online chat|chat]]s, especially those representing the Internet version of official media. The widespread use of the Internet all over the world created a unique opportunity to create a meeting place for both sides in many conflicts, such as the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s. Often this gives a unique chance to find new, alternative solutions to the conflict, but often the Internet is turned into the battlefield by contradicting parties creating endless \"online battles.\"\n\n[[Internet radio]] and [[podcast]]s are other growing independent media based on the Internet.\n\n==Blogs==\nWith the rise of digital media, there is a move from the traditional journalist to the blogger or amateur journalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com/local--files/lydiamiljan/lydia+miljan.pdf|title=The file does not exist|author=|date=|website=theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com}}</ref> Blogs can be seen as a new genre of journalism because of their \"narrative style of news characterized by personalization\" that moves away from traditional journalism's approach,<ref>Wall 2005, p. 154.</ref> changing journalism into a more conversational and decentralized type of news.<ref name=\"auto10\">Wall 2005, p. 157.</ref> Blogging has become a large part of the transmitting of news and ideas across cites, states, and countries, and bloggers argue that blogs themselves are now breaking stories.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> Even online news publications have blogs that are written by their affiliated journalists or other respected writers.  Blogging allows readers and journalists to be opinionated about the news and talk about it in an open environment.  Blogs allow comments where some news outlets do not, due to the need to [[Moderation system|constantly monitor]] what is posted.  By allowing comments, the reader can interact with a story instead of just absorbing the words on the screen. According to one 2007 study, 15% of those who read blogs read them for news.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synovate survey: New study shows Americans' blogging behaviour |url=http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |publisher=synovate.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015005/http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |archivedate=2011-08-15 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, many blogs are highly opinionated and have a [[bias]]. Some are not verified to be true. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) established guidelines mandating that bloggers disclose any free goods or services they receive from third parties in 2009 in response to a question of the integrity of product and service reviews in the online community.<ref>http://ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm|title=FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials|work=ftc.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe development of blogging communities has partly resulted because of the lack of local news coverage, the spread of misinformation, and the manipulation of news. Blogging platforms are often used as mediums to spread ideas and connect to others with similar mentalities. Anonymity lives within these platforms that circulates different perspectives. Some have postulated that blogs\u2019 usage of public opinions as facts has gained them status and creditability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molek-Kozakowska|first=Katarzyna|date=August 2013|title=Book review: Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1750481313485398c|journal=Discourse & Communication|language=en-US|volume=7|issue=3|pages=365\u2013367|doi=10.1177/1750481313485398c|issn=1750-4813}}</ref> Memes are often shared on these blogs due to its social phenomenon and its relation to existing subcultures which often attain high engagement. Traditional journalism has helped set the foundation for blogs, which are frequently used to question mainstream media reported by journalist.\n\n==Citizen journalism==\nDigital journalism's lack of a traditional \"editor\" has given rise to [[citizen journalism]]. The early advances that the digital age offered journalism were faster research, easier editing, conveniences, and a faster delivery time for articles. The Internet has broadened the effect that the digital age has on journalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio|date=2019-03-16|title=The 5Ws and 1H of Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=7|issue=3|pages=351\u2013358|doi=10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|issn=2167-0811}}</ref> Because of the popularity of the Internet, most people have access and can add their forms of journalism to the information network. This allows anyone who wants to share something they deem important that has happened in their community. Individuals who are not professional journalists who present news through their blogs or websites are often referred to as citizen journalists. One does not need a <!-- college? -->[[Academic degree|degree]] to be a citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed. Some companies use the information that a citizen journalist relays when they themselves can not access certain situations, for example, in countries where [[freedom of the press]] is limited. Anyone can [[Internet video|record]] events happening and send it anywhere they wish, or put it on their website. Non-profit and grassroots digital journalism sites may have far fewer resources than their corporate counterparts, yet due to digital media are able to have websites that are technically comparable.<ref>Kawamoto 2003, p. 15.</ref> Other media outlets can then pick up their story and run with it as they please, thus allowing information to reach wider audiences.\n\nFor citizen journalism to be effective and successful, there needs to be citizen editors. Their role being to solicit other people to provide accurate information and to mediate interactivity among users. An example can be found in the start-up of the South Korean online daily newspaper, [[OhMyNews]], where the founder recruited several hundred volunteer \"citizen reporters\" to write news articles that were edited and processed by four professional journalists.<ref>Bentley 2011, p. 107.</ref>\n\n==News collections==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet also offers options such as personalized news feeds and [[News aggregator|aggregators]], which compile news from different websites into one site. One of the most popular news aggregators is [[Google News]]. Others include  [[Topix.net]], and [[TheFreeLibrary.com]].\n\nBut, some people see too much personalization as detrimental. For example, some fear that people will have narrower exposure to news, seeking out only those commentators who already agree with them.\n\nAs of March 2005, [[Wikinews]] rewrites articles from other news organizations.

However, it is likely that the exact nature and roles of digital journalism will not be fully known for some time.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe first type of digital journalism, called [[teletext]], was invented in the UK in 1970. Teletext is a system allowing viewers to choose which stories they wish to read and see it immediately. The information provided through teletext is brief and instant, similar to the information seen in digital journalism today.  {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The information was broadcast between the frames of a television signal in what was called the Vertical Blanking Interval or VBI.\n\nAmerican journalist, Hunter S. Thompson relied on early digital communication technology beginning by using a fax machine to report from the 1971 US presidential campaign trail as documented in his book [[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail]].\n\nAfter the invention of teletext was the invention of [[videotex]], of which [[Prestel]] was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979<ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 36.</ref> with various British newspapers such as the [[Financial Times]] lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. Videotex closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end-user demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Third Wave of Online Journalism|url= http://www.ojr.org/ojr/future/1019174689.php|publisher=ojr.org}}</ref>\n\nAmerican newspaper companies took notice of the new technology and created their own videotex systems, the largest and most ambitious being Viewtron, a service of Knight-Ridder launched in 1981. Others were Keycom in Chicago and Gateway in Los Angeles. All of them had closed by 1986.\n\nNext came computer Bulletin Board Systems. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several smaller newspapers started online news services using BBS software and telephone modems. The first of these was the Albuquerque Tribune in 1989.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in September 1992 [[breaking news|broke the news]] of [[Electronic Arts]]' acquisition of [[Origin Systems]] on [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], before its next issue went to press.<ref name=\"wilson199212\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=101 | title=Anatomy of a Rumor | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1992<!-- -12 --> | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=210}}</ref> Online news websites began to proliferate in the 1990s.  An early adopter was ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] which offered online news as [[Nando]]. Steve Yelvington wrote on the [[Poynter Institute]] website about [[Nando]], owned by The N&O, by saying \"Nando evolved into the first serious, professional [[news site]] on the World Wide Web\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It originated in the early 1990s as \"NandO Land\".  It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, [[Netscape Navigator]] (1994), and [[Internet Explorer]] (1995).<ref name=\"auto4\">Scott 2005, p. 94.</ref> By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty-four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their [[news aggregator]]s (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAlso, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', was founded in 1995. In 2001 the ''[[American Journalism Review]]'' called ''Salon'' the Internet's \"preeminent independent venue for journalism.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=314 |title=Can Salon Make It? |first= Paul |last=Fahri |magazine=American Journalism Review|volume= March 2001 |accessdate= July 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, for the first time, more Americans reported getting their national and international news from the internet, rather than newspapers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tossed By A Gale|work=The Economist|date=May 14, 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13642689}}{{Subscription}}</ref> Young people aged 18 to 29 now primarily get their news via the Internet, according to a Pew Research Center report.<ref name=\"auto6\">{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Meghan|title=Internet Surpasses Television as Main News Source for Young Adults [STUDY].|url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/internet-surpasses-television-as-main-news-source-for-young-adults-study/|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref> Audiences to news sites continued to grow due to the launch of new news sites, continued investment in news online by conventional news organizations, and the continued growth in internet audiences overall.<ref name=\"Pew09-5\">{{cite web |title=The State of the Online News Media 2009 |work=Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. |url=http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_online_intro.php?media=5 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316185250/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_online_intro.php?media=5 |archivedate=2010-03-16 }}</ref> Sixty-five percent of youth now primarily access the news online.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nMainstream news sites are the most widespread form of online newsmedia production.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> As of 2000, the vast majority of journalists in the Western world now use the internet regularly in their daily work.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> In addition to mainstream news sites, digital journalism is found in index and category sites (sites without much original content but many links to existing news sites), meta- and comment sites (sites about newsmedia issues like media watchdogs), and [[Virtual community|share and discussion sites]] (sites that facilitate the connection of people, like [[Slashdot]]).<ref>Deuze 2003, p. 208-211.</ref><ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 15.</ref> Blogs are also another digital journalism phenomenon capable of fresh information, ranging from personal sites to those with audiences of hundreds of thousands.<ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 16.</ref> Digital journalism is involved in the cloud journalism<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Fondevila |last1=Gasc\u00f3n|first2= Joan |last2=Francesc |year=2010 |title=El cloud journalism: un nuevo concepto de producci\u00f3n para el periodismo del siglo XXI |journal= Observatorio (OBS*) |volume= 4, N\u00fam. 1 (2010) |pages= 19\u201335 |issn= 1646-5954 |url=http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/view/315/321}}</ref> phenomenon, a constant flow of contents in the Broadband Society.<ref>Fondevila Gasc\u00f3n, Joan Francesc (2009). \"El papel decisivo de la banda ancha en el Espacio Iberoamericano del Conocimiento\".

Some news organizations use the Web exclusively or as a secondary outlet for their content. The [[Online News Association]], founded in 1999, is the largest organization representing online journalists, with more than 1,700 members whose principal livelihood involves gathering or producing news for digital presentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists.org/?page=onamission|title=Online News Association|author=Online News Association|work=journalists.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. Newspapers may lose [[classified advertising]] to websites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography. These organizations are concerned about real and perceived loss of viewers and circulation to the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pew Research Journalism Project|url=http://www.journalism.org/2014/03/26/state-of-the-news-media-2014-key-indicators-in-media-and-news/|website=Journalism.org|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nHyperlocal journalism is journalism within a very small community.

People can comment on articles and start discussion boards to discuss articles. Before the Internet, spontaneous discussion between readers who had never met was impossible. The process of discussing a news item is a big portion of what makes for digital journalism.  People add to the story and connect with other people who want to discuss the topic.\n\nDigital journalism creates an opportunity for [[niche audience]]s, allowing people to have more options as to what to view and read.\n\nDigital journalism opens up new ways of storytelling; through the technical components of the new medium, digital journalists can provide a variety of media, such as [[sound|audio]], [[video]], and [[digital photography]].\n\nDigital journalism represents a revolution of how news is consumed by society. Online sources are able to provide quick, efficient, and accurate [[Reporter|reporting]] of breaking news in a matter of seconds, providing society with a synopsis of events as they occur. Throughout the development of the event, journalists are able to feed online sources the information keeping readers up-to-date in mere seconds. The speed in which a story can be posted can affect the accuracy of the reporting in a way that doesn't usually happen in print journalism. Before the emergence of digital journalism the printing process took much more time, allowing for the discovery and correction of errors.\n\nNews consumers must become Web literate and use [[critical thinking]] to evaluate the credibility of sources.  Because it is possible for anyone to write articles and post them on the Internet, the definition of journalism is changing. Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable [[Online newspaper|news websites]], it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the [[Information overload|massive amount of information]] coming in from the digital area of journalism.\n\nThere are great advantages with digital journalism and the new [[blogging]] evolution that people are becoming accustomed to, but there are disadvantages. For instance, people are used to what they already know and can't always catch up quickly with the new technologies in the 21st century. The goals of print and digital journalism are the same, although different tools are needed to function.\n\nThe interaction between the writer and consumer is new, and this can be credited to digital journalism. There are many ways to get personal thoughts on the Web. There are some disadvantages to this, however, the main one being [[Formal verification|factual information]]. There is a pressing need for accuracy in digital journalism, and until they find a way to press accuracy, they will still face some criticism.\n\nOne major dispute regards the credibility of these online news websites. A digital journalism credibility study performed by the [[Online News Association]] compares the online public credibility ratings to actual media respondent credibility ratings. Looking at a variety of online media sources, the study found that overall the public saw online media as more credible than it actually is.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105151127/http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |archive-date=2006-11-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe effects of digital journalism are evident worldwide. This form of journalism has pushed journalists to reform and evolve. Older journalists who are not tech savvy have felt the blunt force of this. In recent months, a number of older journalists have been pushed out and younger journalists brought in because of their lower cost and ability to work in advanced technology settings.\n\n==Impact on publishers==\nMany newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', have created [[Online newspaper|online sites]] to remain competitive and have taken advantage of audio, video, and text linking to remain at the top of news consumers' lists as most of the news enthusiasm now reach their base through hand held devices such as smartphones, tablets etc. Hence audio or video backing is a definite advantage.\n\nNewspapers rarely break news stories any more, with most websites reporting on breaking news before the cable news channels.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Digital journalism allows for reports to start out vague and generalized, and progress to a better story. Newspapers and TV cable are at a disadvantage because they generally can only put together stories when an ample amount of detail and information are available.  Often, newspapers have to wait for the next day, or even two days later if it is a late-breaking story, before being able to publish it. Newspapers lose a lot of ground to their online counterparts, with [[advertising|ad revenue]] shifting to the Internet, and subscription to the printed paper decreasing. People are now able to find the news they want, when they want, without having to leave their homes or pay to receive the news {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, even though there are still people who are willing to pay for online journalistic content.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Himma-Kadakas |first1=Marju |last2=K\u00f5uts |first2=Ragne |title=Who Is Willing to Pay for Online Journalistic Content? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=106 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.345 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/345|year=2015 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nBecause of this, many people have viewed digital journalism as the death of journalism.{{who|date=February 2011}} According to communication scholar Nicole Cohen, \"four practices stand out as putting pressure on traditional journalism production: outsourcing, unpaid labour, metrics and measurement, and automation\".<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nicole S.|date=2015-04-03|title=From Pink Slips to Pink Slime: Transforming Media Labor in a Digital Age|journal=The Communication Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=98\u2013122|doi=10.1080/10714421.2015.1031996|issn=1071-4421}}</ref> Free advertising on websites such as [[Craigslist]] has transformed how people publicize; the Internet has created a faster, cheaper way for people to get news out, thus creating the shift in ad sales from standard newspapers to the Internet.

The growth in digital journalism and the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|near collapse of the economy]] has also led to [[Layoff|downsizing]] for those in the industry.\n\nStudents wishing to become journalists now need to be familiar with digital journalism in order to be able to contribute and develop journalism skills. Not only must a journalist analyze their audience and focus on effective communication with them, they have to be quick; news websites are able to update their stories within minutes of the news event. Other skills may include creating a website and uploading information using basic programming skills.\n\nCritics believe digital journalism has made it easier for individuals who are not qualified journalists to misinform<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ekstr\u00f6m|first=Mats|last2=Lewis|first2=Seth C.|last3=Westlund|first3=Oscar|date=2020-01-20|title=Epistemologies of digital journalism and the study of misinformation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819856914|journal=New Media & Society|language=en-US|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205\u2013212|doi=10.1177/1461444819856914|issn=1461-4448}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ciampaglia|first=Giovanni Luca|last2=Mantzarlis|first2=Alexios|last3=Maus|first3=Gregory|last4=Menczer|first4=Filippo|date=2018-03-27|title=Research Challenges of Digital Misinformation: Toward a Trustworthy Web|url=https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2783|journal=AI Magazine|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=65\u201374|doi=10.1609/aimag.v39i1.2783|issn=2371-9621}}</ref> the general public. Many believe that this form of journalism has created a number of sites that do not have credible information. Sites such as [[Perez Hilton|PerezHilton.com]] have been criticized for blurring the lines between journalism and opinionated writing.\n\nSome critics believe that newspapers should not switch to a solely Internet-based format, but instead keep a component of print as well as digital.\n\nDigital journalism allows citizens and readers the opportunity to join in on [[threaded discussion]]s relating to a news article that has been read by the public. This offers an excellent source for writers and reporters to decide what is important and what should be omitted in the future. These threads can provide useful information to writers of digital journalism so that future articles can be pruned and improved to possibly create a better article the next time around.\n\n== Implications on traditional Journalism ==\n[[Digitizing|Digitization]] is currently causing many changes to traditional journalistic practices. The labor of journalists, in general, is becoming increasingly dependent on digital journalism. Scholars outline that this is a change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the [[Labor process theory|labor process]].<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\">{{Cite journal|last=\u00d6rnebring|first=Henrik|date=2010-02-03|title=Technology and journalism-as-labour: Historical perspectives|journal=Journalism|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=57\u201374|doi=10.1177/1464884909350644}}</ref> They also contend that this is simply the de-skilling of some skills and the up-skilling of others.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> This theory is in contention to the notion that [[technological determinism]] is negatively effecting [[journalism]], as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being [[outsourcing]], [[algorithm]]s, and [[automation]].<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/> Although Cohen believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way.<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/>\n\nThere is also the impact that digital journalism is influencing the uprising of citizen journalism. Because digital journalism takes place online and is contributed mostly by citizens on user-generated content sites, there is competition growing between the two. Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to verify the source of information.\n\n==Work outside traditional press==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet has also given rise to more participation by people who are not normally journalists, such as with Indy Media (Max Perez).\n\n[[Bloggers]] write on [[web logs]] or [[blogs]]. Traditional journalists often do not consider bloggers to automatically be journalists. This has more to do with standards and professional practices than the medium. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding journalism attracts amateur journalists, as well as ambitious professionals that are restrained by the boundaries set by traditional press. However, the implication of these types of journalism is that it disregards the professional norms of journalistic practices that ensures accuracy and impartiality of the content.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Andrea|date=2014-11-24|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272\u2013288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915}}</ref>  But, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, blogging has generally gained at least more attention and has led to some effects on mainstream journalism, such as exposing problems related to a television piece about President [[George W. Bush]]'s National Guard Service.\n\nRecent legal judgements have determined that bloggers are entitled to the same protections as other journalists subject to the same responsibilities. In the United States, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ has been instrumental] in advocating for the [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ rights of journalist bloggers].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=6&doc_id=285455&doc_no=H028579|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|publisher=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that:\"[96] A second preliminary question is what the new defence should be called. In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test. This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style. However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists. These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets. I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is \"available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium\": Jameel, at para. 54.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7837/index.do|title=Grant v. Torstar Corp. - SCC Cases (Lexum)|author=|date=|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}</ref>\n\nOther significant tools of on-line journalism are Internet [[Internet forum|forums]], [[discussion boards]] and [[online chat|chat]]s, especially those representing the Internet version of official media. The widespread use of the Internet all over the world created a unique opportunity to create a meeting place for both sides in many conflicts, such as the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s. Often this gives a unique chance to find new, alternative solutions to the conflict, but often the Internet is turned into the battlefield by contradicting parties creating endless \"online battles.\"\n\n[[Internet radio]] and [[podcast]]s are other growing independent media based on the Internet.\n\n==Blogs==\nWith the rise of digital media, there is a move from the traditional journalist to the blogger or amateur journalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com/local--files/lydiamiljan/lydia+miljan.pdf|title=The file does not exist|author=|date=|website=theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com}}</ref> Blogs can be seen as a new genre of journalism because of their \"narrative style of news characterized by personalization\" that moves away from traditional journalism's approach,<ref>Wall 2005, p. 154.</ref> changing journalism into a more conversational and decentralized type of news.<ref name=\"auto10\">Wall 2005, p. 157.</ref> Blogging has become a large part of the transmitting of news and ideas across cites, states, and countries, and bloggers argue that blogs themselves are now breaking stories.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> Even online news publications have blogs that are written by their affiliated journalists or other respected writers.  Blogging allows readers and journalists to be opinionated about the news and talk about it in an open environment.  Blogs allow comments where some news outlets do not, due to the need to [[Moderation system|constantly monitor]] what is posted.  By allowing comments, the reader can interact with a story instead of just absorbing the words on the screen. According to one 2007 study, 15% of those who read blogs read them for news.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synovate survey: New study shows Americans' blogging behaviour |url=http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |publisher=synovate.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015005/http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |archivedate=2011-08-15 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, many blogs are highly opinionated and have a [[bias]]. Some are not verified to be true. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) established guidelines mandating that bloggers disclose any free goods or services they receive from third parties in 2009 in response to a question of the integrity of product and service reviews in the online community.<ref>http://ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm|title=FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials|work=ftc.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe development of blogging communities has partly resulted because of the lack of local news coverage, the spread of misinformation, and the manipulation of news. Blogging platforms are often used as mediums to spread ideas and connect to others with similar mentalities. Anonymity lives within these platforms that circulates different perspectives. Some have postulated that blogs\u2019 usage of public opinions as facts has gained them status and creditability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molek-Kozakowska|first=Katarzyna|date=August 2013|title=Book review: Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1750481313485398c|journal=Discourse & Communication|language=en-US|volume=7|issue=3|pages=365\u2013367|doi=10.1177/1750481313485398c|issn=1750-4813}}</ref> Memes are often shared on these blogs due to its social phenomenon and its relation to existing subcultures which often attain high engagement. Traditional journalism has helped set the foundation for blogs, which are frequently used to question mainstream media reported by journalist.\n\n==Citizen journalism==\nDigital journalism's lack of a traditional \"editor\" has given rise to [[citizen journalism]]. The early advances that the digital age offered journalism were faster research, easier editing, conveniences, and a faster delivery time for articles. The Internet has broadened the effect that the digital age has on journalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio|date=2019-03-16|title=The 5Ws and 1H of Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=7|issue=3|pages=351\u2013358|doi=10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|issn=2167-0811}}</ref> Because of the popularity of the Internet, most people have access and can add their forms of journalism to the information network. This allows anyone who wants to share something they deem important that has happened in their community. Individuals who are not professional journalists who present news through their blogs or websites are often referred to as citizen journalists. One does not need a <!-- college? -->[[Academic degree|degree]] to be a citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed. Some companies use the information that a citizen journalist relays when they themselves can not access certain situations, for example, in countries where [[freedom of the press]] is limited. Anyone can [[Internet video|record]] events happening and send it anywhere they wish, or put it on their website. Non-profit and grassroots digital journalism sites may have far fewer resources than their corporate counterparts, yet due to digital media are able to have websites that are technically comparable.<ref>Kawamoto 2003, p. 15.</ref> Other media outlets can then pick up their story and run with it as they please, thus allowing information to reach wider audiences.\n\nFor citizen journalism to be effective and successful, there needs to be citizen editors. Their role being to solicit other people to provide accurate information and to mediate interactivity among users. An example can be found in the start-up of the South Korean online daily newspaper, [[OhMyNews]], where the founder recruited several hundred volunteer \"citizen reporters\" to write news articles that were edited and processed by four professional journalists.<ref>Bentley 2011, p. 107.</ref>\n\n==News collections==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet also offers options such as personalized news feeds and [[News aggregator|aggregators]], which compile news from different websites into one site. One of the most popular news aggregators is [[Google News]]. Others include  [[Topix.net]], and [[TheFreeLibrary.com]].\n\nBut, some people see too much personalization as detrimental. For example, some fear that people will have narrower exposure to news, seeking out only those commentators who already agree with them.\n\nAs of March 2005, [[Wikinews]] rewrites articles from other news organizations. Original reporting remains a challenge on the Internet as the burdens of verification and legal risks (especially from plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions like BC) remain high in the absence of any net-wide approach to defamation.<ref>O'Grady v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 139 Cal.App. 4th 1423, modified by O'Grady v.
