Noa, claiming she feels bad for him, picks Daniel up and offers him \"three wishes\" for the night. They visit a restaurant owned by Noa's friend, where the two begin to realize how attracted they are to each other. Daniel uses one of his wishes to have Noa call his sister Natalie and offer her advice on how to handle starting a new school. While at a club, Noa's ex Colin tries to win her back. Her manager Lewis reveals to Daniel that Noa has a history of fooling around with strangers, and that she doesn't really love him. Daniel leaves in disgust and walks home, but discovers the next day that his family's bakery has dozens of new customers after Noa gave them a shout-out on social media.

Noa, claiming she feels bad for him, picks Daniel up and offers him \"three wishes\" for the night. They visit a restaurant owned by Noa's friend, where the two begin to realize how attracted they are to each other. Daniel uses one of his wishes to have Noa call his sister Natalie and offer her advice on how to handle starting a new school. While at a club, Noa's ex Colin tries to win her back. Her manager Lewis reveals to Daniel that Noa has a history of fooling around with strangers, and that she doesn't really love him. Daniel leaves in disgust and walks home, but discovers the next day that his family's bakery has dozens of new customers after Noa gave them a shout-out on social media.

MHS has a set of Advanced Placement courses that allow students to begin their college education while still receiving high school credit. Below is a list of the Advanced Placement, and most notable courses.\n\n====Levels====\n:'''Advanced Placement''' \u2013 Offers students the ability to earn college credit. These courses are more difficult and require more dedication than the average high school course. Advanced Placement (AP) courses culminate with an exam administered by the College Board which determines how much credit the student receives.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n:'''Honors''' \u2013 These courses contain challenging material designed for the motivated student. They are more difficult that the standard College Preparatory classes.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n:'''College preparatory''' \u2013 These courses prepare students for traditional college level education.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n:'''Comprehensive''' \u2013 These courses are designed to prepare students for junior (two-year) college or work after high school.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n====Advanced Placement====\nMansfield High School offers Advanced Placement courses in Music Theory, English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, Calculus AB, Computer Science Principles, Statistics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics C, American History, European History, Spanish Language and Composition, French Language and Composition, and Art History.[http://mansfieldhs.ss8.sharpschool.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=72149025] However each student can take at most seven Advanced Placement courses during their stay at MHS.\n\n====Grading====\nStudents at Mansfield High School are graded on a 0-100 scale, where an A is 90-100, a B is 80-89, a C is 70-79, a D is 65-69, and anything below a 65 is considered failing. Students are awarded credit for each successful passing of a course, however if a student is absent from the course too many times, credits may be deducted.[http://mansfieldhs.ss8.sharpschool.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=72149025]\n\n====Class rank====\nClass rank is determined by calculating a student\u2019s course-weighed grade point average over an extended 4.0 scale. Rank is calculated once a year, with the rank calculated after a students sixth semester (junior year) being reported to colleges. Valedictorian and [[Salutatorian]] are determined by calculating class rank after the completion of a seventh semester.\n\nRank is calculated by first converting a final grade to the 4.0 scale, then weighting it depending on what level each course taken is at. That average is then multiplied by the number of credits a student earned and then divided by the total number of possible credits for the course. This result is the student's weighted GPA. This process is repeated for each class and then the sum of all class GPAs are averaged to result in an overall GPA. It is possible to get over a 4.0 GPA once weighting of the student's final grade has occurred.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n===Performing arts===\nBelow are the three areas in which Mansfield High School specializes for students to enroll in the Performing Arts.\n\n:'''Choir''' - The choir puts on several concerts per year, including the Holiday Concert and Spring Concert, and also directs and produces the school's fall play and spring musical.

These courses are more difficult and require more dedication than the average high school course. Advanced Placement (AP) courses culminate with an exam administered by the College Board which determines how much credit the student receives.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n:'''Honors''' \u2013 These courses contain challenging material designed for the motivated student.

Students are awarded credit for each successful passing of a course, however if a student is absent from the course too many times, credits may be deducted.[http://mansfieldhs.ss8.sharpschool.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=72149025]\n\n====Class rank====\nClass rank is determined by calculating a student\u2019s course-weighed grade point average over an extended 4.0 scale. Rank is calculated once a year, with the rank calculated after a students sixth semester (junior year) being reported to colleges. Valedictorian and [[Salutatorian]] are determined by calculating class rank after the completion of a seventh semester.\n\nRank is calculated by first converting a final grade to the 4.0 scale, then weighting it depending on what level each course taken is at. That average is then multiplied by the number of credits a student earned and then divided by the total number of possible credits for the course. This result is the student's weighted GPA. This process is repeated for each class and then the sum of all class GPAs are averaged to result in an overall GPA. It is possible to get over a 4.0 GPA once weighting of the student's final grade has occurred.[http://mhs.mansfieldschools.com/common/pages/UserFile.aspx?fileId=49512543]\n\n===Performing arts===\nBelow are the three areas in which Mansfield High School specializes for students to enroll in the Performing Arts.\n\n:'''Choir''' - The choir puts on several concerts per year, including the Holiday Concert and Spring Concert, and also directs and produces the school's fall play and spring musical.
