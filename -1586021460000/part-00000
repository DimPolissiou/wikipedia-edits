{"title_page": "CalCOFI", "text_new": "[[File:CalCOFIStationMap.png|thumb|360px|right]]\n\n'''CalCOFI''' ('''California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations''') is a multi-agency partnership formed in 1949 to investigate the collapse of the [[sardine]] population off California.\nThe organization's members are from [[NOAA]] Fisheries Service, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]].  The scope of this research has evolved into the study of [[marine ecosystems]] off [[California]] and the management of its [[fisheries]] resources. \nIn 2004, the CalCOFI survey area became one of 26 [[LTER]] (Long Term Ecological Research, [https://lternet.edu/ www.lternet.edu]) research sites.\nThis time-series of oceanographic and fisheries data allows scientists to assess the human impact and effects of climate change on the coastal ocean ecosystem.\nCalCOFI hydrographic & biological data, publications, and web information are distributed for use ([https://calcofi.org/ www.calcofi.org]) without restriction under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.\n\n==Origin==\nThe Pacific [[Sardine]] Fishery was once the largest fishery by volume of the North American Pacific Coast. The fishery developed in the 1920s, peaking in the 1930s with Sardine landings reaching over 700,000 tons in California, but was followed by a precipitous collapse in the 1940s.<ref name=Radovich82/> Recommendations and early warnings of a fishery collapse were given throughout the period with an emphasis of setting annual catch limits given by fishery scientists for example Scofield and [[Frances Naomi Clark|Frances Clark]].<ref name=Scofield31/><ref name=Clark39/>  Disregarding the early warnings the Pacific [[Sardine]] fishery continued in part driven by the wartime requirement for cheap sources of protein and by the 1940s and 1950s catches declined by an order of magnitude to 80,000 tons. In the decade that followed sardine catches continued to decline to 20,000 tons in the 1960s.\n\nThe Sardine Fishery collapse was a major catalyst to the development of the California Cooperative Sardine Research Program- a precursor to the CalCOFI program. The consensus concern for the program was whether this collapse was due to increased fishing pressure or [[environmental change]]. The program was initially led by [[Oscar Elton Sette]], who forged a collaboration between research institutions ([[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]) and government agencies ([[California Fish and Game Commission]]- recently renamed the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]- and the [[United States Fish Commission]]- now known as the [[NOAA Fisheries]] Service) with the goal of resource management and fisheries conservation of the Eastern Pacific.<ref name=Kendall98/>\n\nThe CalCOFI program was initially met with skepticism. The program was seen as a diversionary tactic initiating further picayune studies of sardine abundance to delay sardine catch regulations.<ref name=Scofield/> Nevertheless, after the sardine fishery reached a low point in 1947 efforts were focused on the investigation of the underlying forces that govern sardine abundance.<ref name=MRC/>\n\n==Sampling Pattern==\nThe CalCOFI Station pattern was based on a centric-systematic-area design<ref name=Milne59/>\n\nCalCOFI sampling lines were designed to be normal to the central [[California coast]] centered at [[Point Conception]], designated as CalCOFI Line 80. The original sampling pattern extended from Line 10 at the US-Canada border to Line 120 off Point Eugenia, Baja California Mexico with a spacing of 120 miles between lines (i.e. distance between line 80 and 90 is 120 miles). Since its conception, additional lines were added within the domain creating a 40-mile spacing between lines which are now numbered in fractions of 3's and 7's (80, 83, 87, 90, etc.).<ref name=Kramer72/>\n\nRegular surveying began in 1951, however CalCOFI data go back to 1949. Like all research and fishery surveys, there are many variables which play a role in the design of the survey pattern. The CalCOFI program has surveyed a wide variety of spatial ranges. Thus, CalCOFI surveys are generally grouped into sampling domains which are commonly covered over the duration of this ecological study<ref name=Kramer72 />\n\nThe largest sampling domain, which has been covered multiple times, is the area from the California-Oregon border to the tip of Baja California Sur, Mexico. This region was heavily surveyed in the 1950s (1951, 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958-1960, and 1972). Another large domain runs from [[San Francisco]] to southern [[Baja California]] (surveyed in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1961-1966, 1968, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1980, and 1981).\n\nThe sampling domain extending from [[San Diego]] to [[Avila Beach]] is today called the \"core CalCOFI area\". These 66 stations have been covered over the entire time series, with exceptions only due to years where no cruises were conducted. A series of inshore [https://sccoos.org/overview/ SCCOOS] stations (all at a water depth of approximately 20 m) were added to the core CalCOFI pattern in 2004, resulting in a 75 station pattern.\n\nLess common sampling patterns of intermediate domain have also been conducted. This includes a survey region from [[San Francisco]] to [[San Diego]] which has become increasingly sampled during the spring survey, because the domain covers an expanded region of known sardine spawning grounds. The data from these spring cruise are heavily relied upon for sardine stock assessment and other related research.\n\nEvery line apart from the CalCOFI sampling scheme and its corresponding stations has experienced some degree of difference and variation in spatial and temporal sampling frequency. Furthermore, technological advances have allowed increasing amounts of new chemical, physical, and biological properties to be measured within the water column. Line 90, which is a part of the core CalCOFI station domain positioned across the mid-[[Southern California Bight]], is the best-sampled and most visited line in the time series. The data from Line 90 is used in many transect figures and analyses.\n\nThere are a variety of similar survey programs collecting analogous data across the west coast. These programs range in temporal and spatial extent. One such program is the Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California (IMECOCAL) program out of Mexico which samples the Eastern Pacific around [[Baja California]].<ref name=Barlow2010/><ref name=Baumgartner2008/><ref name=Emmett2005/>\n\n==Gear Used==\nA variety of nets and related instrumentation have been deployed on CalCOFI cruises over the years. Many of these have been developed for use by the CalCOFI program. Oblique tows using a Bongo Net are employed to sample for micronekton, [[mesozooplankton]] and [[ichthyoplankton]]. Vertical tows for icthyoplankton and [[mesozooplankton]] are conducted using a Pairovet and PRPOOS Net. Finally, surface tows with a Manta net are used to sample [[neuston]]. Supplementary sampling focuses on collection of juvenile and small fish via trawling techniques. This includes using a Modified Isaacs Kidd Net, a Matsuda Oozeki Hu trawl (MOHT), and the Nordic rope trawl.\n\n===CalCOFI Nets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CalCOFI Nets\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Net Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n! [[Bongo Net]]\n| Paired ringed nets towed obliquely from a depth of approx. 210 m to the surface with ship speed at approx. 1-2 knots. Water is filtered through the 505 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets with a mouth [[diameter]] of 0.71 m.<ref name=Kramer72 /><ref name=Smith77 /> The right side net is preserved in buffered 5% [[formalin]] and the left side in 90% [[ethanol]]. The Bongo Net is designed to collect [[mesozooplankton]] and its samples are critical in determining [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[larval]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. The data are used in the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] for estimating the [[spawning stock biomass]] of sardine.<ref name=Lo89 /><ref name=Lo2005/><ref name=Lo2010/>  The net functions more efficiently at night due to the decreased net avoidance by [[zooplankton]].<ref name=Ohman95 /><ref name=Lavaniegos2003/> Tow depth, net configuration, mesh size and materials have evolved since the program began. Comparisons of different net methodology and potential ramifications have been published.<ref name=Kramer72 /><ref name=Ahlstrom54/>\n|-\n! [[Pairovet]]\n| The [[Pairovet]] is used to collect [[ichthyoplankton]] via vertical tows from 70 m to the [[sea-surface]] using paired 0.05 m<sup>2</sup> 150 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets. The smaller nylon mesh is specially designed to retain [[fish eggs]] which are found in the upper 70 m.<ref name=Ahlstrom59/><ref name=Moser98/>  The net is employed specifically to collect [[anchovy]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] with 100% efficiency.<ref name=Smith85/>  The aim of the Pairovet is to sample a constant [[volume]] of water at each site, thus it is crucial to keep the net straight up and down. Ship pitch and roll, water currents, net clogs, wire angle, and dragging in the [[neuston]] layer all are possible sources of variance and error. These potential [[variable (research)|variable]]s may force sample out of the mouth of the device, and/or sample loss due to destruction of eggs.<ref name=Hewitt83/>\n|-\n! [[Manta Net]]\n| The [[manta net|Manta Net]] was developed to sample the [[sea-surface]] over a range of oceanic conditions. The net is towed beside the vessel to avoid ship wake, and the mouth is unobstructed by a bridle that might cause avoidance by organisms.<ref name=Brown81/> The net collects [[neuston]], or the animals found on the sea-surface, via filtering water over a 505 [[micron]] net fixed with a 333 micron [https://www.fao.org/3/a-as986e.pdf cod-end]. A variety of [[fish]] species have a prolonged [[Metamorphosis|transformation]] between [[larval]] and [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] stages of development during which time the organisms can be found in the surface layer.\n|}\n\n===Supplementary Nets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Supplementary Nets\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Net Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n! [[Nordic Surface Trawl]]\n| Trawl aimed to sample and collect [[pelagic fish]].<ref name=Griffith2008/> Samples the water using wide trawl doors with a 600 m<sup>2</sup> mouth area filtering water with an 8 mm mesh. The net retains juveniles and certain large larval fish. Recently the net has been fastened with a [[marine mammal excluder device (MMEL)]] to decrease the amount of mammalian impact and mortality.<ref name=Dotson2010/> Data retrieved by the net is used to better understand fishery species [[spawning stock biomass]], in particular the data is important for the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] as it samples a wide distribution of species and size-classes.<ref name=Lo2005/><ref name=Lasker85/>  Additionally, size structure data is paramount in the use of acoustic biomass estimates.<ref name=Zwolinski2012/>\n|-\n! [[Modified Isaacs Kidd Trawl]]\n| Trawl designed to sample [[juvenile pelagic fish]] which can avoid other sampling nets by mid-water trawls. The primary target is mid-sized [[anchovy]] (15 \u2013 60 mm).<ref name=Methot86 /> The frame samples a large volume of water while minimizing avoidance by the target organisms. The net filters about 7,000 m<sup>3</sup> or 100 times as much water per tow as a standard [[bongo net]].<ref name=Methot86/>\n|-\n! [[Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu (MOHT) Trawl]]\n| Trawl designed to capture a multitude of mesopelagic organisms including: [[krill]], late larval and juvenile fishes, and [[micronekton]]. Collects juvenile and small fish assemblages in conjunction with [[multifrequency acoustics]] to estimate the distribution and biomass of sampled species. The [[MOHT]] has a 5.5 m<sup>2</sup> mouth opening, and filters the water at up to 4.5 knots in a variety of oceanic conditions. The MOHT is fixed with a range of cod-end filters to sample a variety of different size classes. It samples the mesopelagic community in a better manner then the bongo or the rope trawl and its data is highly valuable in the determination of health and abundance of important fisheries.<ref name=Oozeki2004/>\n|-\n! [[PRPOOS]]\n| The name of the PRPOOS net is derived from its use during the Planktonic Rate Processes in Oligotrophic Ocean Systems program.  It was formerly known as the Soutar-Hemmigway Animal Trap or \u201cSHAT\u201d.  The net was introduced to CalCOFI cruises by the CCE-LTER program and it is a net designed to sample zooplankton using a 202 micron mesh net with a 50&nbsp;cm diameter. The net is towed vertically to a depth of 210 m.<ref name=Kramer72/>\n|-\n! [[Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES)]]\n| Developed in the mid-1990s to identify fish eggs using video/[[optical plankton counter]]. The sampler functions by constantly pumping water from about 3 m depth. The water passes through a variety of sampling collectors including an optical plankton counter.<ref name=Checkley97/>  Conceived to automate the collection and sorting of fish species, but though it gave promising results, manual identification is still required of the samples to minimize error and misidentification.<ref name=Checkley2000/> The problem is that many pelagic fish eggs share similar optical properties with copepods. Despite this hiccup, the [[CUFES]] is invaluable in the sampling of [[sardine]] and [[anchovy]] [[habitats]].<ref name=Checkley97 /> CUFES data from cruises are commonly used with surface [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] data to show water mass characteristics where sardine, anchovy, and other important fishery species [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].<ref name=Checkley2000 /> The common use of the CUFES at sea is to inform where patches of high egg density are located which can be sampled via nets. The CUFES also impacts the relative [[confidence level]] of net sampling.<ref name=Lo2001/> A variety of research is conducted to determine the relationship between CUFES egg data and net ([[Pairvet]], [[PRPOOS]], etc.) sampled data. Confidence in relations determined is still in question. Thus, CUFES data alone cannot be used to determine estimates of stock biomass.<ref name=Checkley97 /> Nevertheless, the CUFES is an important tool in describing surface patchiness, providing extra data by designating an area as high or low surface egg density.<ref name=Lo2001 />\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Californian pilchard]] \u2014 ''Sardinops sagax caeruleus''\n* [[Sardine run]]\n* {{C|Environmental impact of fishing}}\n\n==Further Information==\n*[http://www.calcofi.org/ California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations]\n*[http://www.lternet.edu/sites/cce/ CCE-LTER Long Term Ecological Research Network]\n*[https://swfsc.noaa.gov/textblock.aspx?Division=FRD&ParentMenuId=658&id=19091 NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070329161842/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/mrd/index.html Cal Fish & Wildlife Marine Resources]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150620224923/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/findingaids/rss-s0050.html California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Records] RSS-S 50.

The scope of this research has evolved into the study of [[marine ecosystems]] off [[California]] and the management of its [[fisheries]] resources. \nIn 2004, the CalCOFI survey area became one of 26 [[LTER]] (Long Term Ecological Research, [https://lternet.edu/ www.lternet.edu]) research sites.\nThis time-series of oceanographic and fisheries data allows scientists to assess the human impact and effects of climate change on the coastal ocean ecosystem.\nCalCOFI hydrographic & biological data, publications, and web information are distributed for use ([https://calcofi.org/ www.calcofi.org]) without restriction under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.\n\n==Origin==\nThe Pacific [[Sardine]] Fishery was once the largest fishery by volume of the North American Pacific Coast. The fishery developed in the 1920's, peaking in the 1930's with Sardine landings reaching over 700,000 tons in California, but was followed by a precipitous collapse in the 1940's.<ref name=Radovich82/> Recommendations and early warnings of a fishery collapse were given throughout the period with an emphasis of setting annual catch limits given by fishery scientists for example Scofield and [[Frances Naomi Clark|Frances Clark]].<ref name=Scofield31/><ref name=Clark39/>  Disregarding the early warnings the Pacific [[Sardine]] fishery continued in part driven by the wartime requirement for cheap sources of protein and by the 1940's and 1950's catches declined by an order of magnitude to 80,000 tons. In the decade that followed sardine catches continued to decline to 20,000 tons in the 1960's.\n\nThe Sardine Fishery collapse was a major catalyst to the development of the California Cooperative Sardine Research Program- a precursor to the CalCOFI program. The consensus concern for the program was whether this collapse was due to increased fishing pressure or [[environmental change]]. The program was initially led by [[Oscar Elton Sette]], who forged a collaboration between research institutions ([[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]) and government agencies ([[California Fish and Game Commission]]- recently renamed the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]- and the [[United States Fish Commission]]- now known as the [[NOAA Fisheries]] Service) with the goal of resource management and fisheries conservation of the Eastern Pacific.<ref name=Kendall98/>\n\nThe CalCOFI program was initially met with skepticism. The program was seen as a diversionary tactic initiating further picayune studies of sardine abundance to delay sardine catch regulations.<ref name=Scofield/> Nevertheless, after the sardine fishery reached a low point in 1947 efforts were focused on the investigation of the underlying forces that govern sardine abundance.<ref name=MRC/>\n\n==Sampling Pattern==\nThe CalCOFI Station pattern was based on a centric-systematic-area design<ref name=Milne59/>\n\nCalCOFI sampling lines were designed to be normal to the central [[California coast]] centered at [[Point Conception]], designated as CalCOFI Line 80. The original sampling pattern extended from Line 10 at the US-Canada border to Line 120 off Point Eugenia, Baja California Mexico with a spacing of 120 miles between lines (i.e. distance between line 80 and 90 is 120 miles). Since its conception, additional lines were added within the domain creating a 40-mile spacing between lines which are now numbered in fractions of 3's and 7's (80, 83, 87, 90, etc.).<ref name=Kramer72/>\n\nRegular surveying began in 1951, however CalCOFI data go back to 1949. Like all research and fishery surveys, there are many variables which play a role in the design of the survey pattern. The CalCOFI program has surveyed a wide variety of spatial ranges. Thus, CalCOFI surveys are generally grouped into sampling domains which are commonly covered over the duration of this ecological study<ref name=Kramer72 />\n\nThe largest sampling domain, which has been covered multiple times, is the area from the California-Oregon border to the tip of Baja California Sur, Mexico. This region was heavily surveyed in the 1950's (1951, 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958-1960, and 1972). Another large domain runs from [[San Francisco]] to southern [[Baja California]] (surveyed in 1953, 1955, 1957, 1961-1966, 1968, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1980, and 1981).\n\nThe sampling domain extending from [[San Diego]] to [[Avila Beach]] is today called the \"core CalCOFI area\". These 66 stations have been covered over the entire time series, with exceptions only due to years where no cruises were conducted. A series of inshore [https://sccoos.org/overview/ SCCOOS] stations (all at a water depth of approximately 20 m) were added to the core CalCOFI pattern in 2004, resulting in a 75 station pattern.\n\nLess common sampling patterns of intermediate domain have also been conducted. This includes a survey region from [[San Francisco]] to [[San Diego]] which has become increasingly sampled during the spring survey, because the domain covers an expanded region of known sardine spawning grounds. The data from these spring cruise are heavily relied upon for sardine stock assessment and other related research.\n\nEvery line apart from the CalCOFI sampling scheme and its corresponding stations has experienced some degree of difference and variation in spatial and temporal sampling frequency. Furthermore, technological advances have allowed increasing amounts of new chemical, physical, and biological properties to be measured within the water column. Line 90, which is a part of the core CalCOFI station domain positioned across the mid-[[Southern California Bight]], is the best-sampled and most visited line in the time series. The data from Line 90 is used in many transect figures and analyses.\n\nThere are a variety of similar survey programs collecting analogous data across the west coast. These programs range in temporal and spatial extent. One such program is the Investigaciones Mexicanas de la Corriente de California (IMECOCAL) program out of Mexico which samples the Eastern Pacific around [[Baja California]].<ref name=Barlow2010/><ref name=Baumgartner2008/><ref name=Emmett2005/>\n\n==Gear Used==\nA variety of nets and related instrumentation have been deployed on CalCOFI cruises over the years. Many of these have been developed for use by the CalCOFI program. Oblique tows using a Bongo Net are employed to sample for micronekton, [[mesozooplankton]] and [[ichthyoplankton]]. Vertical tows for icthyoplankton and [[mesozooplankton]] are conducted using a Pairovet and PRPOOS Net. Finally, surface tows with a Manta net are used to sample [[neuston]]. Supplementary sampling focuses on collection of juvenile and small fish via trawling techniques. This includes using a Modified Isaacs Kidd Net, a Matsuda Oozeki Hu trawl (MOHT), and the Nordic rope trawl.\n\n===CalCOFI Nets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ CalCOFI Nets\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Net Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n! [[Bongo Net]]\n| Paired ringed nets towed obliquely from a depth of approx. 210 m to the surface with ship speed at approx. 1-2 knots. Water is filtered through the 505 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets with a mouth [[diameter]] of 0.71 m.<ref name=Kramer72 /><ref name=Smith77 /> The right side net is preserved in buffered 5% [[formalin]] and the left side in 90% [[ethanol]]. The Bongo Net is designed to collect [[mesozooplankton]] and its samples are critical in determining [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[larval]] [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. The data are used in the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] for estimating the [[spawning stock biomass]] of sardine.<ref name=Lo89 /><ref name=Lo2005/><ref name=Lo2010/>  The net functions more efficiently at night due to the decreased net avoidance by [[zooplankton]].<ref name=Ohman95 /><ref name=Lavaniegos2003/> Tow depth, net configuration, mesh size and materials have evolved since the program began. Comparisons of different net methodology and potential ramifications have been published.<ref name=Kramer72 /><ref name=Ahlstrom54/>\n|-\n! [[Pairovet]]\n| The [[Pairovet]] is used to collect [[ichthyoplankton]] via vertical tows from 70 m to the [[sea-surface]] using paired 0.05 m<sup>2</sup> 150 [[micron]] [[nylon]] mesh nets. The smaller nylon mesh is specially designed to retain [[fish eggs]] which are found in the upper 70 m.<ref name=Ahlstrom59/><ref name=Moser98/>  The net is employed specifically to collect [[anchovy]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] with 100% efficiency.<ref name=Smith85/>  The aim of the Pairovet is to sample a constant [[volume]] of water at each site, thus it is crucial to keep the net straight up and down. Ship pitch and roll, water currents, net clogs, wire angle, and dragging in the [[neuston]] layer all are possible sources of variance and error. These potential [[variable (research)|variable]]s may force sample out of the mouth of the device, and/or sample loss due to destruction of eggs.<ref name=Hewitt83/>\n|-\n! [[Manta Net]]\n| The [[manta net|Manta Net]] was developed to sample the [[sea-surface]] over a range of oceanic conditions. The net is towed beside the vessel to avoid ship wake, and the mouth is unobstructed by a bridle that might cause avoidance by organisms.<ref name=Brown81/> The net collects [[neuston]], or the animals found on the sea-surface, via filtering water over a 505 [[micron]] net fixed with a 333 micron [https://www.fao.org/3/a-as986e.pdf cod-end]. A variety of [[fish]] species have a prolonged [[Metamorphosis|transformation]] between [[larval]] and [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] stages of development during which time the organisms can be found in the surface layer.\n|}\n\n===Supplementary Nets===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Supplementary Nets\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Net Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n! [[Nordic Surface Trawl]]\n| Trawl aimed to sample and collect [[pelagic fish]].<ref name=Griffith2008/> Samples the water using wide trawl doors with a 600 m<sup>2</sup> mouth area filtering water with an 8 mm mesh. The net retains juveniles and certain large larval fish. Recently the net has been fastened with a [[marine mammal excluder device (MMEL)]] to decrease the amount of mammalian impact and mortality.<ref name=Dotson2010/> Data retrieved by the net is used to better understand fishery species [[spawning stock biomass]], in particular the data is important for the [[Daily Egg Production Method]] as it samples a wide distribution of species and size-classes.<ref name=Lo2005/><ref name=Lasker85/>  Additionally, size structure data is paramount in the use of acoustic biomass estimates.<ref name=Zwolinski2012/>\n|-\n! [[Modified Isaacs Kidd Trawl]]\n| Trawl designed to sample [[juvenile pelagic fish]] which can avoid other sampling nets by mid-water trawls. The primary target is mid-sized [[anchovy]] (15 \u2013 60 mm).<ref name=Methot86 /> The frame samples a large volume of water while minimizing avoidance by the target organisms. The net filters about 7,000 m<sup>3</sup> or 100 times as much water per tow as a standard [[bongo net]].<ref name=Methot86/>\n|-\n! [[Matsuda-Oozeki-Hu (MOHT) Trawl]]\n| Trawl designed to capture a multitude of mesopelagic organisms including: [[krill]], late larval and juvenile fishes, and [[micronekton]]. Collects juvenile and small fish assemblages in conjunction with [[multifrequency acoustics]] to estimate the distribution and biomass of sampled species. The [[MOHT]] has a 5.5 m<sup>2</sup> mouth opening, and filters the water at up to 4.5 knots in a variety of oceanic conditions. The MOHT is fixed with a range of cod-end filters to sample a variety of different size classes. It samples the mesopelagic community in a better manner then the bongo or the rope trawl and its data is highly valuable in the determination of health and abundance of important fisheries.<ref name=Oozeki2004/>\n|-\n! [[PRPOOS]]\n| The name of the PRPOOS net is derived from its use during the Planktonic Rate Processes in Oligotrophic Ocean Systems program.  It was formerly known as the Soutar-Hemmigway Animal Trap or \u201cSHAT\u201d.  The net was introduced to CalCOFI cruises by the CCE-LTER program and it is a net designed to sample zooplankton using a 202 micron mesh net with a 50&nbsp;cm diameter. The net is towed vertically to a depth of 210 m.<ref name=Kramer72/>\n|-\n! [[Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES)]]\n| Developed in the mid-1990's to identify fish eggs using video/[[optical plankton counter]]. The sampler functions by constantly pumping water from about 3 m depth. The water passes through a variety of sampling collectors including an optical plankton counter.<ref name=Checkley97/>  Conceived to automate the collection and sorting of fish species, but though it gave promising results, manual identification is still required of the samples to minimize error and misidentification.<ref name=Checkley2000/> The problem is that many pelagic fish eggs share similar optical properties with copepods. Despite this hiccup, the [[CUFES]] is invaluable in the sampling of [[sardine]] and [[anchovy]] [[habitats]].<ref name=Checkley97 /> CUFES data from cruises are commonly used with surface [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] data to show water mass characteristics where sardine, anchovy, and other important fishery species [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].<ref name=Checkley2000 /> The common use of the CUFES at sea is to inform where patches of high egg density are located which can be sampled via nets. The CUFES also impacts the relative [[confidence level]] of net sampling.<ref name=Lo2001/> A variety of research is conducted to determine the relationship between CUFES egg data and net ([[Pairvet]], [[PRPOOS]], etc.) sampled data. Confidence in relations determined is still in question. Thus, CUFES data alone cannot be used to determine estimates of stock biomass.<ref name=Checkley97 /> Nevertheless, the CUFES is an important tool in describing surface patchiness, providing extra data by designating an area as high or low surface egg density.<ref name=Lo2001 />\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Californian pilchard]] \u2014 ''Sardinops sagax caeruleus''\n* [[Sardine run]]\n* {{C|Environmental impact of fishing}}\n\n==Further Information==\n*[http://www.calcofi.org/ California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations]\n*[http://www.lternet.edu/sites/cce/ CCE-LTER Long Term Ecological Research Network]\n*[https://swfsc.noaa.gov/textblock.aspx?Division=FRD&ParentMenuId=658&id=19091 NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070329161842/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/mrd/index.html Cal Fish & Wildlife Marine Resources]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150620224923/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/speccoll/findingaids/rss-s0050.html California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Records] RSS-S 50.

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections.\n\nIn the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.131</ref>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.133</ref>\n\n===French flight===\n\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.137</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.138</ref>\n\nAfter an afternoon of sporadic outbursts between British and French around 4pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the Ville de Pais, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] became the third French ship to surrender, having been flanked by HMS Canada and HMS Alcide. Following the mortal wounding of the captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the Alcide.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.140</ref>\n\nNext to surrender was [[French ship Ardent (1764)|Ardent]] who was flanked by HMS Belliqueux and HMS Prince William.\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> \n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and Formidable close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were Triumphante (Vaudreuil's flagship), Bourgogne (under De La Charette), Magnifique (under Macarty Macteigne), Pluton (under De Rion) and Marseillais (under De Castellane-Majastre).\n\nwith little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes.

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.102</ref>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the Formidable) joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86-89</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.90</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.91</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the \"Zele\" and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|\"Magnanime\"]]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.92</ref>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|Monarch]], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|Valiant]], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|Centaur]] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|Belliqueux]]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS Marlborough]] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.103</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the Marlborough to open fire and engage the French. At this point the Marlborough was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|Dauphin Royal]] who received her full broadside.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.104</ref>\n\nSixteen ships in line separated the Marlborough from the formidable and each stood 200m apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind Marlborough was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS Arrogant]]. Arrogant had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS Alcide]] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS Nonsuch]] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS Conqueror]] under Captain George Balfour.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.105</ref>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on [[HMS Princessa]] who was in command of the first 12 vessels. Princessa was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS Torbay]] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS Anson]] under Captain William Blair. Captain Blair on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS Fame]] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS Russell]] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.107</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS America]] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS Hercules]] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS Prothee]] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm. He later died of these wounds.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.110</ref> Resolution was followed by [[HMS Duke]] under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.111</ref>\n\nAs Formidable was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, As she passed de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The Ville de Paris was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of Formidable in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.113</ref> Formidable entered the smoke and approached the Ville de Paris at 8.40am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.117</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the Formidable in sequence behind the Ville de Paris, the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|Couronne]], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|\u00c9veill\u00e9]] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|Sceptre]] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.119</ref>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.123</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.126</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.122</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections.\n\nIn the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.130</ref> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.131</ref>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.133</ref>\n\n===French flight===\n\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.137</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, ''[[HMS Centaur]]'' and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul. After a further ten minutes the ship was dismasted, and Paul then surrendered to the ''Centaur''.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.138</ref>\n\nAfter an afternoon of sporadic outbursts between British and French around 4pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the Ville de Pais, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] became the third French ship to surrender, having been flanked by HMS Canada and HMS Alcide. Following the mortal wounding of the captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the Alcide.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.140</ref>\n\nNext to surrender was [[French ship Ardent (1764)|Ardent]] who was flanked by HMS Belliqueux and HMS Prince William.\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest. in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> \n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and Formidable close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were Triumphante (Vaudreuil's flagship), Bourgogne (under De La Charette), Magnifique (under Macarty Macteigne), Pluton (under De Rion) and Marseillais (under De Castellane-Majastre).\n\nwith little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n===End of the battle===\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line.

Everett, a speculator from New York State. A downtown district, built only on the south side of the street, faced the busy railroad yard. A large hotel, frequented by business travelers, called the Everett House, was located along this street (South Front Street).\n\nCharles P. Russell, another early investor, built a store on the corner of South Front Street and Center Avenue in 1865. Russell continued living in the community (whereas Mr. Everett soon moved on). He built a fine two-story home and bought grain from local farmers with his business partner O.H. Jackson. Years later, in 1910, Charles Russell partnered in the banking and mercantile businesses with his son, Fred Russell.\n\nA whole line of stores flanked on the ends by the C.P Russell building and the Everett House faced the railroad depot and yard to the north. Establishments included hardware, lumber, wagon and harness makers, livery, drug store, general mercantile, hotels and several saloons.\n\nDoctor Augustus Stinchfield was Eyota's first medical doctor, who came to town after Eyota druggist E.D. Dyar invited him to visit. Both Stinchfield and Dyar once lived in Strong, Maine. Dr. Stinchfield built up an extensive practice, having another office in nearby St. Charles and using part of his home as a hospital. Stinchfield married Martha Bear, the daughter of early settler Benjamin Bear. He arrived in 1873 and left in 1892 when the Mayos from Rochester convinced him to become the first non-family member to partner in their practice.\n\nDr. Rollo C. Dugan, the son of local settler Elijah Dugan, followed Stinchfield's local practice.

The club was formed in 1901 as St. Sidwell's United and played in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] from 1908 until 1920, when that league's top division was absorbed into [[The Football League]] as its new Division Three. The club was the first ever team to play the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]] in 1914, a match which was commemorated in a 2014 friendly game against [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]].\n\nCity took 60 years to achieve their first ever promotion, finishing fourth in [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]] in the [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] season. Since then, the club have mostly oscillated between the [[Football League One|third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth]] divisions, spending five years in the [[Football Conference|Conference]] between 2003 and 2008; having been promoted a further four times (in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]], [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]], [[2007\u201308 Football Conference|2007\u201308]] and [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]]) and relegated five times (in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]], [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]], [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] and [[2011\u201312 in English football|2011\u201312]]).\n\nExeter City have never played above the third tier of English football,<ref name=\"Bennett interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28326462|title=Exeter City return to Brazil one hundred years after special trip|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> and are the club that have played the most seasons in the third tier without ever making the [[Football League Championship|second tier]] in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/ClubLeagueHistorySummary.html|title=Club League History Summary 1888-89 to 2015-16|publisher=MyFootballFacts.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> The club's only major title came in the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season, when [[Terry Cooper (footballer, born 1944)|Terry Cooper]] led City to the Fourth Division title.\n\n==Formation==\nOriginally, it was believed that, following a friendly match between Exeter United and St. Sidwell's United, the two teams merged to become what is now known as Exeter City.<ref name=\"BBC History\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/low/people_and_places/history/newsid_8306000/8306978.stm|title=History of Exeter City FC|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, new light was shed on Exeter City's formation in 2014, when Aidan Hamilton's book ''Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America'' was published. The actual story is that Exeter United, who had formed in 1896 and were the main team in Exeter, struggled for players in 1902 and couldn't play at [[St James Park (Exeter)|St James Park]], \"''as the building erected there for the Co-operative Society was still standing and in use''\". On 25 October 1902, Exeter United lost 3\u20130 to St. Sidwell's United, who were formed in 1901 to challenge Exeter United's dominance in Exeter, at Blackboy Road.<ref name=\"Hamilton\">{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Aidan|title=Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America|publisher=Exeter City AFC Supporters Society|year=2014|isbn=0992967600}}</ref> On 27 October, regarding who the leading team in Exeter was, \"Linesman\" wrote in the ''Western Times'': {{quote|text=Nominally, the distinction belongs to Exeter United. Not only does that organisation bear the City's name, but it had up to last Saturday held undisputed superiority over the other Exeter Clubs. Now, however, it has been displaced from its position by that wonderfully promising Club, St. Sidwell's. The latter, to speak of the team in plural, have now the strongest possible claim, viz., success on the field, to the title. It will not, I think, be questioned by the staunchest supporter of Exeter that the Saints proved themselves a distinctly smarter and more scientific side in the game which ended in their favour by three goals to nil. They are heartily congratulated upon an achievement that will rank as not only the most notable, but also as the most pleasing in the history of the Club. The result is one that should have a very beneficial influence on Exeter football. The immediate effect should be two-fold in its character - St. Sidwell's should be greatly encouraged in their laudable effort to raise the standard of the game, and Exeter United should learn by this sharp lesson of experience that disjointed individualism will always be beaten by intelligent combination.|author=\"Linesman\"|source=''Western Times'' in \"Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America\"<ref name=\"Hamilton\" />}}\n\nIt seems, however, that Exeter United never recovered. The loss to St. Sidwell's United was one of the last games they played. In February 1903, they were not listed in the first round of Devon Cup ties and there was also a fixture between their 'Masters XI' and North Devon School. When the participating clubs for the 1903\u201304 East Devon Senior League was announced, United were not listed. In August 1903, St. Sidwell's United, who had the previous season been crowned Junior champions and had beaten 'Rest of the League' 10\u20132, began training at St James Park. At this point, they were considered the 'premier club in Exeter' according to the ''Devon Evening Express''. Soon after, they began fielding several former Exeter United players, with St. Sidwell's United having effectively defeated and absorbed them. In the edition of 31 August 1904 of the ''Devon Evening Express'', St. Sidwell's United \"''decided to take the title of \"Exeter City\" - a decidedly more suitable name for this strong combination''\".<ref name=\"Hamilton\" />\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Exeter City team 1907-08.jpg|thumb|A team photo of [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in 1907\u201308]]\nShortly after becoming Exeter City, the club entered the East Devon League.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exetercityfc.co.uk/club/history/|title=Exeter City FC History|publisher=Exeter City FC|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> City's first ever competitive game was a 2-1 win over the 110th Battery of the [[Royal Artillery]], in front of a crowd of 600 fans.<ref name=\"BBC History\" /> The club quickly switched to the stronger Plymouth and District League until 1908, when City became a professional football club and joined the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]].<ref name=\"History\" /> City failed to win any honours during their initial seven-year spell in the Southern League,<ref name=\"History\" /> but when both [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] turned down the [[Football Association]]'s request to tour [[South America]], the Grecians were asked to fill in.<ref name=\"Bennett interview\" /> According to Hamilton's research, however, it was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] who declined the offer to tour Argentina, citing the excessive travelling as the reason.<ref name=\"Hamilton\" />\n\nCity originally adopted the green and white quarters kit of St. Sidwell's United.

According to the AFA's minute book for the meeting of 26 February 1914, the item heading 'Team Exeter City' replaced that which had read 'Team de Inglaterra'. Club chairman Michael McGahey, directors Fred Parkhouse and George Middleweek (who paid for his own trip) and their wives, and fifteen players set sail in May 1914.

McGahey wrote of an appointment he had with a Mr Harry Robinson, explaining that once the ship landed in Rio de Janeiro, he phoned the shore from the boat, asking Robinson to join him on board. Once together, McGahey explained how Robinson was the brother of one of his clients (who also happened to attend City's matches) and that they discussed playing \"''a match or matches on'' [their] ''return journey to Rio''\" and that the terms that were mentioned were satisfactory.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nWhile in Rio, the players drove to [[Paissandu Atl\u00e9tico Clube|Paysandu]] (Harry Robinson's team)<ref name=\"Grecian Voices\" /> and [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] in motor vehicles provided by both clubs. At Fluminense, the players had a kickabout for an hour. McGahey was introduced to two Fluminense officials, M\u00e1rio Pernambuco (of the Ground Committee) and Marcondes Ferraz (a board member), who, together with Harry Robinson, suggested that City break their return trip in Rio by staying five days and playing three matches.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nAfter City left Rio for Santos, Paysandu and Fluminense directors met to establish dates and prepared the offer of a contract. Once in Santos, the whole team was put under arrest for bathing in the sea.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/> McGahey wrote to the [[Express and Echo]]: \n\n{{quote|text=The sands were fine and hard, and the boys had some very useful sprints. A little ball practice, and after this was over a dip followed. They, of course, wore their full bathing costumes, and even if there were any persons on the beach, there could be nothing to object to in the slightest. It is quite true that about half a mile away there were some houses. Just as I was getting the boys out of the water to dress, down came a local policeman ... The old buffer, who was armed with a sword and pistol, and who, we found afterwards, had been afraid to approach us before for fear we were armed, seemed pacified. I gave him a cigarette, when down marched Sergeant with one of the villa residents, who had apparently complained. Then the talking and gesticulating commenced - shoulders shrugging, hands flourishing, eyebrows raising, and tongues going. We gathered that we were all under arrest, and had to accompany these two men to the local Chief of Police. Naturally, at first, we were inclined to cut up rough, but I advised the boys to take it quietly. I offered, as I was in control, to accompany him provided the others were allowed to return to the ship, but apparently he wanted the lot. I thought it was merely a question of local corruption, and that they merely wanted a fine. Of course, the lads all took it as a joke, and would not have missed it for anything - the only fear was that, as the boat sailed at 2, and it was then 12.30, we should miss it. We accordingly all boarded a tram-car, with the sergeant and policeman in charge of us and the fellow who had complained.|author=Michael McGahey|source=[[Express and Echo]] in \"Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America\"<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>}}\n\nOnce both sides had been heard, the 'Commissioner of Police' dismissed the complaint and the travelling party made it to the ship in time. The ship arrived in Montevideo early in the morning of 10 June. Mr Williams, the AFA secretary, and Mr MacKinnon, the AFA treasurer, met up with the travelling party there, having undertaking a nine-hour journey by steamer from [[Buenos Aires]], with the purpose of welcoming City and assisting them in their landing.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\n===Argentina===\nOnce in Argentina, City played eight games. The first was a 3-0 defeat to \"Combinado Norte\" at [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]'s [[Estadio Racing Club|stadium]] in [[Avellaneda]] on 14 June 1914. After being allowed to train at [[Belgrano Athletic Club]], City beat Combinado Sur 3\u20130 on 21 June, again at Racing Club's stadium, with goals from [[William Hunter (footballer, born 1888)|William Hunter]], Harry Holt and Billy Lovett. On 24 June, City beat Racing Club 2\u20130, Holt and Fred Marshall with the goals. This game was marred by a bizarre incident however, as when City took the lead Racing Club's secretary threatened the referee with a revolver, attempting to persuade him to send off Lagan (who had kicked Ochoa in the stomach, meaning he had to be carried off).<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nAfter this, there was also a problem with the scheduling, as City were due to play [[Liga Argentina de Football|Liga Argentina]] on the 28th and a game in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] on the 29th. However, the Rosario League Committee had not been consulted and refused to accept the arrangements, resenting the fact that their game would be the day after one of the main fixtures of the tour and claiming that City would not be able to produce their best form. The games were rescheduled, with the Rosario game now being played on the 28th, a less important scratch XI on the 29th and the Liga Argentina game was postponed to the 9 July.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nCity beat [[Liga Rosarina de Football|Liga Rosarina]] 3-1 ([[Fred Whittaker (footballer)|Fred Whittaker]] 2, Marshall) on 28 June at [[Argentino de Rosario|C.A. Argentino]]'s stadium. The party then took the overnight train back to Buenos Aires. The fifth game of the tour saw City beat Combinados 5-0 (Whittaker 3, Lovett, Jimmy Lagan), again at Racing Club. On 9 July, City beat Liga Argentina 3-0 (Hunter 2, [[Fred Goodwin (footballer)|Goodwin]]) at Racing Club, before drawing 0\u20130 against a representative team of Argentinians (Argentinos) on 11 July at [[Club Ferro Carril Oeste|Ferro Carril Oeste]]'s [[Estadio Arquitecto Ricardo Etcheverry|ground]] in [[Caballito, Buenos Aires|Caballito]]. The final game in Argentina was again against Liga Argentina at Racing Club on 12 July, a 3-1 (Lovett 2, Goodwin) win. This game saw many changes to City's XI, with trainer Charlie Pratt having to play in goal due to an injury to [[Dick Pym]] and Reg Loram having influenza. Injuries to Holt and Marshall also meant reserve defender Gus Harding was selected to play.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nNewspapers in Argentina were left disappointed with City's performances during the tour, ''Tribuna'' describing them as \"''the most mediocre team of professionals sent out by the [[The Football Association|FA]] from the home of football''\", and the ''[[Buenos Aires Herald]]'' complaining that the Grecians were not \"''sufficiently superior''\".<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\n===Brazil===\n[[File:Exeter city fc 1914.jpg|thumb|250px|The team that played the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]] in 1914]]\nWhen the idea of playing three extra matches was discussed with McGahey on 8 June, what Harry Robinson and the Fluminense officials had in mind were games involving players based in Rio de Janeiro. In early July, the Brazilian press were reproducing reports from City's matches in Argentina. On 2 July, ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'' announced that Fluminense and Paysandu had agreed, with McGahey, a contract for the games to go ahead, just above the report of the Racing game. City would be the first team of professionals to play in Brazil. Originally, it was hoped that City would also play a game in [[Sao Paulo]], however, time constraints meant that it was not possible. The original programme was for City to play Rio English (known as Estrangeiros) on 18 July, Brasileiros on 19 July and the Cariocas (known as Rio de Janeiro) on 21 July. These last two were eventually switched. It was at this point that the [[Campeonato Carioca|Liga Metropolitana]] approached the [[APEA]] with the proposal that the Brasileiros and Estrangeiros games include [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|Paulista]] players.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\n[[File:Brazil v Exeter City (1914).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Exeter City playing [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] in Rio de Janeiro]]\nCity's ship landed in Rio de Janeiro on 17 July. On 18 July, City beat Rio English 3-0 (Hunter, Holt, Lovett). The game was very one-sided, with City keeper Reg Loram (Pym missed the remainder of the tour through injury), the only amateur in the team, not being tested until late in the game. On 19 July, it was announced in the news that Paulista players would travel to Rio. Some had had difficulty getting time off work, so APEA's treasurer travelled to Rio to change the dates of the final two games in order for three Brasileiros from S\u00e3o Paulo -Rubens Salles (Paulistano), Xavier (Ipiranga) and [[Arthur Friedenreich]] (Ipiranga)- to play in a league match and catch the overnight train. Later that day, City beat Rio de Janeiro 5-3 (Charlie Pratt 2, Lagan, Goodwin, Hunter). [[Harry Welfare]] had put the hosts 3-1 ahead, at which point City became more physical, something which was criticised by the ''[[Correio da Manh\u00e3 (Brazil)|Correio da Manh\u00e3]]''. On 21 July, City lost 2\u20130 to Brasileiros (a selection of Brazilian players from Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo). During the game, Lagan and Fort walked off the pitch, but were convinced to return to the field and finish the game. This is considered to be the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]]'s first ever game. All three games were played at [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]]'s [[Est\u00e1dio das Laranjeiras]]. Harry Robinson played in the first two games and refereed the last one, making sixteen saves in the first game for Rio English.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nOn 27 September, seven members from the side that defeated City represented Brazil against Argentina in the Copa Roca match, which Brazil won 1\u20130.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/> The ''Gazeta do S\u00e3o Paulo'' reported in 1928 that City had expressed, through diplomatic channels, a desire to return to Brazil.

The club was formed in 1901 as St. Sidwell's United and played in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] from 1908 until 1920, when that league's top division was absorbed into [[The Football League]] as its new Division Three. The club was the first ever team to play the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]] in 1914, a match which was commemorated in a 2014 friendly game against [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]].\n\nCity took 60 years to achieve their first ever promotion, finishing fourth in [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]] in the [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] season. Since then, the club have mostly oscillated between the [[Football League One|third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth]] divisions, spending five years in the [[Football Conference|Conference]] between 2003 and 2008; having been promoted a further four times (in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]], [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]], [[2007\u201308 Football Conference|2007\u201308]] and [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309]]) and relegated five times (in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]], [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384]], [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]], [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] and [[2011\u201312 in English football|2011\u201312]]).\n\nExeter City have never played above the third tier of English football,<ref name=\"Bennett interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28326462|title=Exeter City return to Brazil one hundred years after special trip|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 July 2014|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> and are the club that have played the most seasons in the third tier without ever making the [[Football League Championship|second tier]] in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfootballfacts.com/ClubLeagueHistorySummary.html|title=Club League History Summary 1888-89 to 2015-16|publisher=MyFootballFacts.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref> The club's only major title came in the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season, when [[Terry Cooper (footballer, born 1944)|Terry Cooper]] led City to the Fourth Division title.\n\n==Formation==\nOriginally, it was believed that, following a friendly match between Exeter United and St. Sidwell's United, the two teams merged to become what is now known as Exeter City.<ref name=\"BBC History\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/low/people_and_places/history/newsid_8306000/8306978.stm|title=History of Exeter City FC|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, new light was shed on Exeter City's formation in 2014, when Aidan Hamilton's book ''Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America'' was published. The actual story is that Exeter United, who had formed in 1896 and were the main team in Exeter, struggled for players in 1902 and couldn't play at [[St James Park (Exeter)|St James Park]], \"''as the building erected there for the Co-operative Society was still standing and in use''\". On 25 October 1902, Exeter United lost 3-0 to St. Sidwell's United, who were formed in 1901 to challenge Exeter United's dominance in Exeter, at Blackboy Road.<ref name=\"Hamilton\">{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Aidan|title=Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America|publisher=Exeter City AFC Supporters Society|year=2014|isbn=0992967600}}</ref> On 27 October, regarding who the leading team in Exeter was, \"Linesman\" wrote in the ''Western Times'': {{quote|text=Nominally, the distinction belongs to Exeter United. Not only does that organisation bear the City's name, but it had up to last Saturday held undisputed superiority over the other Exeter Clubs. Now, however, it has been displaced from its position by that wonderfully promising Club, St. Sidwell's. The latter, to speak of the team in plural, have now the strongest possible claim, viz., success on the field, to the title. It will not, I think, be questioned by the staunchest supporter of Exeter that the Saints proved themselves a distinctly smarter and more scientific side in the game which ended in their favour by three goals to nil. They are heartily congratulated upon an achievement that will rank as not only the most notable, but also as the most pleasing in the history of the Club. The result is one that should have a very beneficial influence on Exeter football. The immediate effect should be two-fold in its character - St. Sidwell's should be greatly encouraged in their laudable effort to raise the standard of the game, and Exeter United should learn by this sharp lesson of experience that disjointed individualism will always be beaten by intelligent combination.|author=\"Linesman\"|source=''Western Times'' in \"Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America\"<ref name=\"Hamilton\" />}}\n\nIt seems, however, that Exeter United never recovered. The loss to St. Sidwell's United was one of the last games they played. In February 1903, they were not listed in the first round of Devon Cup ties and there was also a fixture between their 'Masters XI' and North Devon School. When the participating clubs for the 1903\u201304 East Devon Senior League was announced, United were not listed. In August 1903, St. Sidwell's United, who had the previous season been crowned Junior champions and had beaten 'Rest of the League' 10-2, began training at St James Park. At this point, they were considered the 'premier club in Exeter' according to the ''Devon Evening Express''. Soon after, they began fielding several former Exeter United players, with St. Sidwell's United having effectively defeated and absorbed them. In the edition of 31 August 1904 of the ''Devon Evening Express'', St. Sidwell's United \"''decided to take the title of \"Exeter City\" - a decidedly more suitable name for this strong combination''\".<ref name=\"Hamilton\" />\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Exeter City team 1907-08.jpg|thumb|A team photo of [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in 1907\u201308]]\nShortly after becoming Exeter City, the club entered the East Devon League.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exetercityfc.co.uk/club/history/|title=Exeter City FC History|publisher=Exeter City FC|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> City's first ever competitive game was a 2-1 win over the 110th Battery of the [[Royal Artillery]], in front of a crowd of 600 fans.<ref name=\"BBC History\" /> The club quickly switched to the stronger Plymouth and District League until 1908, when City became a professional football club and joined the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]].<ref name=\"History\" /> City failed to win any honours during their initial seven-year spell in the Southern League,<ref name=\"History\" /> but when both [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] turned down the [[Football Association]]'s request to tour [[South America]], the Grecians were asked to fill in.<ref name=\"Bennett interview\" /> According to Hamilton's research, however, it was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] who declined the offer to tour Argentina, citing the excessive travelling as the reason.<ref name=\"Hamilton\" />\n\nCity originally adopted the green and white quarters kit of St. Sidwell's United.

According to the AFA's minute book for the meeting of 26 February 1914, the item heading 'Team Exeter City' replaced that which had read 'Team de Inglaterra'.

McGahey wrote of an appointment he had with a Mr Harry Robinson, explaining that once the ship landed in Rio de Janeiro, he phoned the shore from the boat, asking Robinson to join him on board. Once together, McGahey explained how Robinson was the brother of one of his clients (who also happened to attend City's matches) and that they discussed playing \"''a match or matches on'' [their] ''return journey to Rio''\" and that the terms that were mentioned were satisfactory.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nWhile in Rio, the players drove to [[Paissandu Atl\u00e9tico Clube|Paysandu]] (Harry Robinson's team)<ref name=\"Grecian Voices\" /> and [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] in motor vehicles provided by both clubs. At Fluminense, the players had a kickabout for an hour. McGahey was introduced to two Fluminense officials, M\u00e1rio Pernambuco (of the Ground Committee) and Marcondes Ferraz (a board member), who, together with Harry Robinson, suggested that City break their return trip in Rio by staying five days and playing three matches.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nAfter City left Rio for Santos, Paysandu and Fluminense directors met to establish dates and prepared the offer of a contract. Once in Santos, the whole team was put under arrest for bathing in the sea.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/> McGahey wrote to the [[Express and Echo]]: \n\n{{quote|text=The sands were fine and hard, and the boys had some very useful sprints. A little ball practice, and after this was over a dip followed. They, of course, wore their full bathing costumes, and even if there were any persons on the beach, there could be nothing to object to in the slightest. It is quite true that about half a mile away there were some houses. Just as I was getting the boys out of the water to dress, down came a local policeman ... The old buffer, who was armed with a sword and pistol, and who, we found afterwards, had been afraid to approach us before for fear we were armed, seemed pacified. I gave him a cigarette, when down marched Sergeant with one of the villa residents, who had apparently complained. Then the talking and gesticulating commenced - shoulders shrugging, hands flourishing, eyebrows raising, and tongues going. We gathered that we were all under arrest, and had to accompany these two men to the local Chief of Police. Naturally, at first, we were inclined to cut up rough, but I advised the boys to take it quietly. I offered, as I was in control, to accompany him provided the others were allowed to return to the ship, but apparently he wanted the lot. I thought it was merely a question of local corruption, and that they merely wanted a fine. Of course, the lads all took it as a joke, and would not have missed it for anything - the only fear was that, as the boat sailed at 2, and it was then 12.30, we should miss it. We accordingly all boarded a tram-car, with the sergeant and policeman in charge of us and the fellow who had complained.|author=Michael McGahey|source=[[Express and Echo]] in \"Have you ever played Brazil?: The story of Exeter City's 1914 tour of South America\"<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>}}\n\nOnce both sides had been heard, the 'Commissioner of Police' dismissed the complaint and the travelling party made it to the ship in time. The ship arrived in Montevideo early in the morning of 10 June. Mr Williams, the AFA secretary, and Mr MacKinnon, the AFA treasurer, met up with the travelling party there, having undertaking a nine-hour journey by steamer from [[Buenos Aires]], with the purpose of welcoming City and assisting them in their landing.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\n===Argentina===\nOnce in Argentina, City played eight games. The first was a 3-0 defeat to \"Combinado Norte\" at [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]]'s [[Estadio Racing Club|stadium]] in [[Avellaneda]] on 14 June 1914. After being allowed to train at [[Belgrano Athletic Club]], City beat Combinado Sur 3-0 on 21 June, again at Racing Club's stadium, with goals from [[William Hunter (footballer, born 1888)|William Hunter]], Harry Holt and Billy Lovett. On 24 June, City beat Racing Club 2-0, Holt and Fred Marshall with the goals. This game was marred by a bizarre incident however, as when City took the lead Racing Club's secretary threatened the referee with a revolver, attempting to persuade him to send off Lagan (who had kicked Ochoa in the stomach, meaning he had to be carried off).<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nAfter this, there was also a problem with the scheduling, as City were due to play [[Liga Argentina de Football|Liga Argentina]] on the 28th and a game in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] on the 29th. However, the Rosario League Committee had not been consulted and refused to accept the arrangements, resenting the fact that their game would be the day after one of the main fixtures of the tour and claiming that City would not be able to produce their best form. The games were rescheduled, with the Rosario game now being played on the 28th, a less important scratch XI on the 29th and the Liga Argentina game was postponed to the 9 July.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nCity beat [[Liga Rosarina de Football|Liga Rosarina]] 3-1 ([[Fred Whittaker (footballer)|Fred Whittaker]] 2, Marshall) on 28 June at [[Argentino de Rosario|C.A. Argentino]]'s stadium. The party then took the overnight train back to Buenos Aires. The fifth game of the tour saw City beat Combinados 5-0 (Whittaker 3, Lovett, Jimmy Lagan), again at Racing Club. On 9 July, City beat Liga Argentina 3-0 (Hunter 2, [[Fred Goodwin (footballer)|Goodwin]]) at Racing Club, before drawing 0-0 against a representative team of Argentinians (Argentinos) on 11 July at [[Club Ferro Carril Oeste|Ferro Carril Oeste]]'s [[Estadio Arquitecto Ricardo Etcheverry|ground]] in [[Caballito, Buenos Aires|Caballito]]. The final game in Argentina was again against Liga Argentina at Racing Club on 12 July, a 3-1 (Lovett 2, Goodwin) win. This game saw many changes to City's XI, with trainer Charlie Pratt having to play in goal due to an injury to [[Dick Pym]] and Reg Loram having influenza. Injuries to Holt and Marshall also meant reserve defender Gus Harding was selected to play.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nNewspapers in Argentina were left disappointed with City's performances during the tour, ''Tribuna'' describing them as \"''the most mediocre team of professionals sent out by the [[The Football Association|FA]] from the home of football''\", and the ''[[Buenos Aires Herald]]'' complaining that the Grecians were not \"''sufficiently superior''\".<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\n===Brazil===\n[[File:Exeter city fc 1914.jpg|thumb|250px|The team that played the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]] in 1914]]\nWhen the idea of playing three extra matches was discussed with McGahey on 8 June, what Harry Robinson and the Fluminense officials had in mind were games involving players based in Rio de Janeiro. In early July, the Brazilian press were reproducing reports from City's matches in Argentina. On 2 July, ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'' announced that Fluminense and Paysandu had agreed, with McGahey, a contract for the games to go ahead, just above the report of the Racing game. City would be the first team of professionals to play in Brazil. Originally, it was hoped that City would also play a game in [[Sao Paulo]], however, time constraints meant that it was not possible. The original programme was for City to play Rio English (known as Estrangeiros) on 18 July, Brasileiros on 19 July and the Cariocas (known as Rio de Janeiro) on 21 July. These last two were eventually switched. It was at this point that the [[Campeonato Carioca|Liga Metropolitana]] approached the [[APEA]] with the proposal that the Brasileiros and Estrangeiros games include [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|Paulista]] players.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\n[[File:Brazil v Exeter City (1914).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Exeter City playing [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] in Rio de Janeiro]]\nCity's ship landed in Rio de Janeiro on 17 July. On 18 July, City beat Rio English 3-0 (Hunter, Holt, Lovett). The game was very one-sided, with City keeper Reg Loram (Pym missed the remainder of the tour through injury), the only amateur in the team, not being tested until late in the game. On 19 July, it was announced in the news that Paulista players would travel to Rio. Some had had difficulty getting time off work, so APEA's treasurer travelled to Rio to change the dates of the final two games in order for three Brasileiros from S\u00e3o Paulo -Rubens Salles (Paulistano), Xavier (Ipiranga) and [[Arthur Friedenreich]] (Ipiranga)- to play in a league match and catch the overnight train. Later that day, City beat Rio de Janeiro 5-3 (Charlie Pratt 2, Lagan, Goodwin, Hunter). [[Harry Welfare]] had put the hosts 3-1 ahead, at which point City became more physical, something which was criticised by the ''[[Correio da Manh\u00e3 (Brazil)|Correio da Manh\u00e3]]''. On 21 July, City lost 2-0 to Brasileiros (a selection of Brazilian players from Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo). During the game, Lagan and Fort walked off the pitch, but were convinced to return to the field and finish the game. This is considered to be the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]]'s first ever game. All three games were played at [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]]'s [[Est\u00e1dio das Laranjeiras]]. Harry Robinson played in the first two games and refereed the last one, making sixteen saves in the first game for Rio English.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>\n\nOn 27 September, seven members from the side that defeated City represented Brazil against Argentina in the Copa Roca match, which Brazil won 1-0.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/> The ''Gazeta do S\u00e3o Paulo'' reported in 1928 that City had expressed, through diplomatic channels, a desire to return to Brazil.

By the 19th century, the farming plots (which had been for centuries subdivided into [[Hide (unit)|hides]] and [[furlong]]s) were encircled by major municipal roads for Brighton.  With building developments across Brighton beginning to encroach upon the fields, the tracks that had divided the individual hide plots were normalized into streets, and the area was soon appropriated as a new settlement and market area.  [[John Furner]] planted a market garden in the plots, and by 1840 a rail hub had been set up on the northern border of North Laine, [[Brighton railway station]].\n\nDuring the reigns of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] and through the first quarter of the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], despite the grandeur of their Royal Pavilion, the North Laine section was known mostly for its squalor, abysmal living conditions and high concentration of slaughterhouses. One resident of note was [[George Herbert Volk]], second son of railway engineer [[Magnus Volk]], who worked in a small workshop at 86 Gloucester Road in the years 1910-1912. This building is now home to Silicon Beach Training. By the 1860s, the city began to clean up the area, knocking down old tenement houses (population density in one slum neighbourhood, Orange Row in the Pimlico slum district, was approximately 130 people to 17 houses) to replace them with more modern streets.  A famous resident at this time was [[Tom Sayers]], a popular British heavyweight [[boxing]] champion of the middle [[Victorian era]].  He was born in the Pimlico slum area and trained in North Laine.  At his death in 1865, 10,000 people attended his funeral at [[Highgate]], [[London]].\n\n===1970s: Saved from demolition===\nKen Fines (1923\u20132008) was Borough Planning Officer for Brighton from 1974 to 1983. He is credited with having saved the North Laine area from extensive redevelopment that could have seen existing buildings being replaced by new high-rise buildings, a flyover and a large car park. Fines felt the area had charm, and pressured the local council to retain it. After considerable opposition by council members and businesses, the council eventually came round to his view, and the North Laine Conservation Area was designated in 1977, named after his observation of the historic name.

[[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is situated in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] near the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. The population was 10,334 at the 2010 census.\n\nExeter is located on [[California State Route 65|State Highway 65]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of [[California State Route 198|Highway 198]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[California State Route 99|Highway 99]]. Exeter is within a 3 to 4 hour drive of both [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and 30 minutes from the entrance to [[Sequoia National Park]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe public school system in Exeter consists of: Exeter Union High School (9-12), the Wilson Middle School (6-8), Rocky Hill Elementary (K-5), Lincoln Elementary (K-5) and Kaweah High School (a continuation high school). The 1999-2000 enrollment was: grades K-8, 1,936 and grades 9-12, 1101 students.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:2009-0725-CA-Exeter-Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The Exeter Historical Museum is housed in the old Mt. Whitney Power Company Substation, formerly the headquarters of the Exeter Police Department.]]\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, [[Yokuts]] settled around an area in an oak forest two miles north of Exeter.  The current town site was a plain that possessed elk, antelope, frogs, and deer.<ref name=\"CofE\"/> Rocky Hill, to the east of the city, offered shelter to native tribes when the plain flooded. Several caves on the hill contain petroglyphs, though some of the most important of these were destroyed by local vandals/looters and poorly managed and unsupervised steer.\n\nThe town site traces its roots to the construction of a railroad line through the [[San Joaquin Valley]], by 1888 a line passed through the area.  A representative of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], D.W. Parkhurst, purchased the land from an early settler, John Firebaugh, and formed the town which he named after his own hometown of [[Exeter|Exeter, England]].<ref name=\"CofE\"/>\n\n[[Image:Mural10.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Exeter boasts its own outdoor art gallery featuring 31 murals depicting local history, folklore, and culture<ref name=\"ExChamber\"/>]]\n\nThe damming of the Kaweah valley during the 1930s provided a reliable source of water for agriculture. Cattle ranching grew at the beginning of the 20th century, led by the Gill Cattle Company, which opened in the late 1800s and was once the largest such business in the United States.<ref name=\"CofE\"/> The town incorporated in 1911. In October, 1929, Exeter was the site of a large Anti-Filipino race riot. A mob stormed a Filipino work camp, bludgeoning 50 Filipino laborers and burning their camp to the ground. This race-riot sparked a wave of Anti-Filipino hatred.<ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Hatred Once Flared on Central Coast |publisher=The Weekend Pinnacle Online |url=http://www.pinnaclenews.com/life/contentview.asp?c=198024 |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151157/http://www.pinnaclenews.com/life/contentview.asp?c=198024 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref> In 2006 the Exeter city of commerce officially apologized for such actions and offered restitution to survivors.{{Citation needed|reason=previously cited article didn't mention anything about apology|date=May 2018}}\n\nProfessional artists depicting the history of the area have painted huge murals on exterior walls throughout the downtown area.

[[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is situated in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] near the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. The population was 10,334 at the 2010 census.\n\nExeter is located on [[California State Route 65|State Highway 65]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} south of [[California State Route 198|Highway 198]] and {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of [[California State Route 99|Highway 99]]. Exeter is within a 3 to 4 hour drive of both [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and 30 minutes from the entrance to [[Sequoia National Park]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe public school system in Exeter consists of: Exeter Union High School (9-12), the Wilson Middle School (6-8), Rocky Hill Elementary (K-5), Lincoln Elementary (K-5) and Kaweah High School (a continuation high school). The 1999-2000 enrollment was: grades K-8, 1,936 and grades 9-12, 1101 students.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:2009-0725-CA-Exeter-Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The Exeter Historical Museum is housed in the old Mt. Whitney Power Company Substation, formerly the headquarters of the Exeter Police Department.]]\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, [[Yokuts]] settled around an area in an oak forest two miles north of Exeter.  The current town site was a plain that possessed elk, antelope, frogs, and deer.<ref name=\"CofE\"/> Rocky Hill, to the east of the city, offered shelter to native tribes when the plain flooded. Several caves on the hill contain petroglyphs, though some of the most important of these were destroyed by local vandals/looters and poorly managed and unsupervised steer.\n\nThe town site traces its roots to the construction of a railroad line through the [[San Joaquin Valley]], by 1888 a line passed through the area.  A representative of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], D.W. Parkhurst, purchased the land from an early settler, John Firebaugh, and formed the town which he named after his own hometown of [[Exeter|Exeter, England]].<ref name=\"CofE\"/>\n\n[[Image:Mural10.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Exeter boasts its own outdoor art gallery featuring 31 murals depicting local history, folklore, and culture<ref name=\"ExChamber\"/>]]\n\nThe damming of the Kaweah valley during the 1930s provided a reliable source of water for agriculture. Cattle ranching grew at the beginning of the 20th century, led by the Gill Cattle Company, which opened in the late 1800s and was once the largest such business in the United States.<ref name=\"CofE\"/> The town incorporated in 1911. In October, 1929, Exeter was the site of a large Anti-Filipino race riot. A mob stormed a Filipino work camp, bludgeoning 50 Filipino laborers and burning their camp to the ground. This race-riot sparked a wave of Anti-Filipino hatred.<ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Hatred Once Flared on Central Coast |publisher=The Weekend Pinnacle Online |url=http://www.pinnaclenews.com/life/contentview.asp?c=198024 |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151157/http://www.pinnaclenews.com/life/contentview.asp?c=198024 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref> In 2006 the Exeter city of commerce officially apologized for such actions and offered restitution to survivors.{{Citation needed|reason=previously cited article didn't mention anything about apology|date=May 2018}}\n\nProfessional artists depicting the history of the area have painted huge murals on exterior walls throughout the downtown area.
