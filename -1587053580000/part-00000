The world average temperature is rising due to the [[greenhouse effect]] caused by increasing levels of [[greenhouse gases]], especially [[carbon dioxide]].  When the global temperature changes, the changes in climate are not expected to be uniform across the [[Earth]]. In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high [[latitudes]] change more quickly than the [[tropics]], and the margins of [[biome]] regions change faster than do their cores.\n\nRegional [[effects of global warming]] vary in nature.  Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice.  In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or [[weather system]].  In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. The increasing temperatures from greenhouse gases have been causing sea levels to rise for many years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7637/full/541262d.html|title=Sea-level rise for centuries to come.|last=|first=|date=|website=Nature|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThere are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere.  The [[coast]] can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]].\n\nThe [[Arctic]], [[Africa]], small islands and [[Asia]]n [[river delta|megadelta]]s are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change.<ref name=\"ar4 especially affected regions\" /> [[Africa]] is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple existing stresses and low [[Climate adaptation|adaptive capacity]]. Climate change is projected to decrease [[freshwater]] availability in central, south, east and southeast Asia, particularly in large [[river basin]]s. With [[population growth]] and increasing demand from higher standards of living, this decrease could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s. Small islands, whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes, are already exposed to [[extreme weather]] events and changes in sea level.

Existing stresses include poverty, political conflicts, and [[ecosystem]] degradation.\n*By 2050, between 350 million and 601 million people are projected to experience increased [[water stress]] due to [[climate change]]\n*Climate variability and change is projected to severely compromise [[climate change and agriculture|agricultural production]], including access to food, across Africa, which means there will be high food insecurity.\n*Toward the end of the 21st century, projected [[sea level rise]] will likely affect low-lying coastal areas with large populations\n*Climate variability and change can negatively impact [[human health]]. In many African countries, other factors already threaten human health. For example, [[malaria]] threatens health in [[southern Africa]] and the [[Eastern Highlands]].\n\n===Impacts on Arctic and Antarctic===\n*[[Climate change in the Arctic]] will likely reduce the thickness and extent of glaciers and ice sheets.\n*Changes in natural ecosystems will likely have detrimental effects on many organisms including [[migratory bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, and higher predators. Climate change will likely cause changes in dominance structures in plant communities, with shrubs expanding <ref name=\"dx.doi.org\">{{cite journal | last1 = Alatalo | first1 = JM | last2 = Little | first2 = CJ | last3 = J\u00e4gerbrand | first3 = AK | last4 = Molau | first4 = U | year = 2014 | title = Dominance hierarchies, diversity and species richness of vascular plants in an alpine meadow: contrasting short and medium term responses to simulated global change | journal = PeerJ | volume = 2 | issue = | page = e406 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.406 | pmid=24883260 | pmc=4034599}}</ref>\n*In the Arctic, climate changes will likely reduce the extent of [[sea ice]] and [[permafrost]], which can have mixed effects on human settlements. Negative impacts could include damage to infrastructure and changes to winter activities such as ice fishing and ice road transportation. Positive impacts could include more navigable northern sea routes.\n* Continued permafrost degradation will likely result in unstable infrastructure in Arctic regions, or Alaska before 2100. Thus, impacting roads, pipelines and buildings, as well as water distribution, and cause [[Slope stability|slope failures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.uaf.edu/north_slope_permafrost_agu15/|year=2015|title=North Slope permafrost thawing sooner than expected|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks}}</ref>\n*The reduction and melting of permafrost, sea level rise, and stronger storms may worsen coastal erosion.\n*Terrestrial and marine ecosystems and habitats are projected to be at risk to invasive species, as climatic barriers are lowered in both polar regions.\n\n===Impacts on Asia===\n{{further|Effects of global warming on South Asia|Effects of global warming in China|Effects of global warming in Thailand}}\n*[[Glacier]]s in [[Asia]] are melting at a faster rate than ever documented in historical records. Melting glaciers increase the risks of flooding and rock avalanches from destabilized slopes.\n*Climate change is projected to decrease [[freshwater]] availability in central, south, east and southeast Asia, particularly in large [[river basin]]s. With [[population growth]] and increasing demand from higher standards of living, this decrease could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s.\n*Increased [[flood]]ing from the sea and, in some cases, from rivers, threatens coastal areas, especially heavily populated delta regions in south, east, and southeast Asia.\n*By the mid-21st century, crop yields could increase up to 20% in east and southeast Asia. In the same period, yields could decrease up to 30% in central and south Asia.\n*Sickness and death due to [[diarrhoeal disease]] are projected to increase in east, south, and southeast Asia due to projected changes in the [[hydrological cycle]] associated with climate change.\n*Agricultural demand from China's crops lead to land degradation and land modifications which in turn leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions. [[Environmental factor#Socioeconomic Drivers]] \n\n===Impacts on Europe===\n{{main|Climate change in Europe}}\n*Wide-ranging impacts of climate change have already been documented in [[Europe]]. These impacts include retreating glaciers, longer growing seasons, species range shifts, and heat wave-related health impacts.\n*Future impacts of climate change are projected to negatively affect nearly all European regions. Many economic sectors, such as agriculture and energy, could face challenges.\n*In southern Europe, higher temperatures and drought may reduce water availability, [[hydropower]] potential, summer [[tourism]], and crop productivity.\n*In central and eastern Europe, summer [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is projected to decrease, causing higher water stress. Forest productivity is projected to decline. The frequency of [[peatland]] fires is projected to increase.\n*In northern Europe, climate change is initially projected to bring mixed effects, including some benefits such as reduced demand for heating, increased crop yields, and increased forest growth. However, as climate change continues, negative impacts are likely to outweigh benefits. These include more frequent winter floods, endangered ecosystems, and increasing ground instability.\n\n==={{anchor|South America}}Impacts on South America===\n{{further|Climate change in Brazil}}\n*By mid-century, increases in temperature and decreases in soil moisture are projected to cause savanna to gradually replace tropical forest in the eastern [[Amazon basin]].\n*In drier areas, climate change will likely worsen drought, leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]] (increased salt content) and desertification (land degradation) of agricultural land. The productivity of [[livestock]] and some important crops such as [[maize]] and [[coffee]] are projected to decrease, with adverse consequences for [[food security]]. In temperate zones, [[soybean]] yields are projected to increase.\n*Sea level rise is projected to increase risk of flooding, displacement of people, salinization of drinking water resources, and [[coastal erosion]] in low-lying areas.\n*Changes in precipitation patterns and the melting of glaciers are projected to significantly affect water availability for human consumption, agriculture, and energy generation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/577701468018561725/pdf/555410PUB0Redu1EPI1958813201PUBLIC1.pdf|title=Reducing poverty, protecting livelihoods, and building assets in a changing climate : social implications of climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean|last=Verner|first=Dorte|date=2010|publisher=World Bank|others=Verner, Dorte.|isbn=9780821383780|location=Washington, DC|pages=2|oclc=667295593}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|North America}}Impacts on North America===\n{{further|Global warming in Canada|Climate change in Mexico|Effects of climate change in the United States|Mesoamerican nephropathy}}\n[[Image:Maps of projected changes in Northern Hemisphere seasonal mean surface air temperature from the late 20th century to the mid-21st century, based on SRES emissions scenario A1B.png|thumb|300px|left |alt=Refer to caption|[[Global climate model#Projections of future climate change|Projected change]] in seasonal mean surface air temperature from the late 20th century (1971-2000 average) to the middle 21st century (2051-2060).<ref name=\"gfdl northern hemisphere projection\">\n{{Include-USGov\n|agency=[[NOAA]]\n|source={{citation\n | author=NOAA\n | date= January 2007\n | work=GFDL Climate Modeling Research Highlights\n | title=Patterns of greenhouse warming\n | url=http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/cms-filesystem-action/user_files/kd/pdf/gfdlhighlight_vol1n6.pdf\n | volume=1\n | issue=6\n | publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (GFDL)\n | location=Princeton, NJ, USA\n}}\n}}.

Crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or that depend on highly utilized water resources will likely face major challenges.\n*Increases in the number, intensity, and duration of heat waves during the course of the century are projected to further challenge cities that currently experience heat waves, with potential for adverse health impacts. Older populations are most at risk.\n*Climate change will likely increasingly stress coastal communities and habitats, worsening the existing stresses of development and pollution.\n\nAs to 2019, climate change have already increased [[wildfires]] frequency and power in [[Canada]], especially in [[Alberta]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Derworiz |first1=Colette |title='Can't be any more clear': Scientist says fires in Alberta linked to climate change |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/can-t-be-any-more-clear-scientist-says-fires-in-alberta-linked-to-climate-change-1.4458503 |accessdate=12 June 2019 |agency=CTV News |date=June 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Impacts on Oceania===\n{{main|Effects of global warming on Australia|Climate change in New Zealand}}\n*[[Water security]] problems are projected to intensify by 2030 in southern and eastern [[Australia]], and in the northern and some eastern parts of [[New Zealand]].\n*Significant [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] is projected to occur by 2020 in some ecologically rich sites, including the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and the [[Wet Tropics of Queensland]].\n*Sea level rise and more severe [[storm]]s and coastal [[flooding]] will likely impact coastal areas. Coastal development and population growth in areas such as [[Cairns]] and [[Southeast Queensland]] (Australia) and [[Northland Region|Northland]] to [[Bay of Plenty]] (New Zealand), would place more people and [[infrastructure]] at risk.\n*By 2030, increased [[drought]] and [[fire]] is projected to cause declines in agricultural and forestry production over much of southern and eastern Australia and parts of eastern New Zealand.\n*Extreme storm events are likely to increase failure of [[floodplain]] protection and urban drainage and sewerage, as well as damage from storms and fires.\n*More [[heat wave]]s may cause more deaths and more [[power outage|electrical blackout]]s.\n\n===Impacts on Small Islands===\n{{further|Climate change in Grenada|Alliance of Small Island States}}\n*Small islands, whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes, are already exposed to [[extreme weather]] events and changes in sea level. This existing exposure will likely make these areas sensitive to the effects of climate change.\n*Deterioration in coastal conditions, such as beach erosion and [[coral bleaching]], will likely affect local resources such as fisheries, as well as the value of tourism destinations.\n*Sea level rise is projected to worsen inundation, storm surge, erosion, and other [[coastal hazards]]. These impacts would threaten vital infrastructure, settlements, and facilities that support the livelihood of island communities.\n*By mid-century, on many small islands (such as the [[Caribbean]] and [[Pacific]]), climate change is projected to reduce already limited water resources to the point that they become insufficient to meet demand during low-rainfall periods.\n*Invasion by non-native species is projected to increase with higher temperatures, particularly in mid- and high-latitude islands.\n\n====Inundation, displacement, and national sovereignty of small islands ====\nAccording to scholar Tsosie, environmental disparities among disadvantaged communities including poor and racial minorities, extend to global inequalities between the developed and developing countries.<ref name=\"ref 10\">{{cite journal|last=Tsosie|first=Rebecca|title=Indigenous People and Environmental Justice:The Impact of Climate Change|journal=University of Colorado Law Review|year=2007|volume=78|pages=1625}}</ref> For example, according to Barnett, J. and Adger, W.N. the projected damage to small islands and atoll communities will be a consequence of climate change caused by developing countries that will disproportionately affect these developing nations.<ref name=\"ref 9\">{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Jon|author2=Adger, W.

Some of the coldest places on Earth, such as the dry valleys of Antarctica, lack significant ice or snow coverage due to a lack of snow.

In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high [[latitudes]] change more quickly than the [[tropics]], and the margins of [[biome]] regions change faster than do their cores.\n\nRegional [[effects of global warming]] vary in nature.  Some are the result of a generalised global change, such as rising temperature, resulting in local effects, such as melting ice.  In other cases, a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or [[weather system]].  In such cases, the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend. The increasing temperatures from greenhouse gases have been causing sea levels to rise for many years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7637/full/541262d.html|title=Sea-level rise for centuries to come.|last=|first=|date=|website=Nature|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThere are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting or forming ice, changing the [[hydrological cycle]] (of [[evaporation]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) and changing [[ocean current|currents in the ocean]]s and air flows in the atmosphere.  The [[coast]] can also be considered a region, and will suffer severe impacts from [[sea level rise]].\n\nThe [[Arctic]], [[Africa]], small islands and [[Asia]]n [[river delta|megadelta]]s are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change.<ref name=\"ar4 especially affected regions\" /> [[Africa]] is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple existing stresses and low [[Climate adaptation|adaptive capacity]].

With [[population growth]] and increasing demand from higher standards of living, this decrease could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s. Small islands, whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes, are already exposed to [[extreme weather]] events and changes in sea level. This existing exposure will likely make these areas sensitive to the effects of climate change.\n\n== Background ==\nWith very high confidence, scientists have concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes, particularly regional temperature increases.<ref name=\"rosenzweig observed impacts\">{{citation|author=Rosenzweig |at=[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch1s1-es.html Executive summary] |chapter=Chapter 1: Assessment of Observed Changes and Responses in Natural and Managed Systems |chapter-url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch1.html |display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG2|2007}}.</ref> Impacts include changes in regional rainfall patterns,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=M.

Melting glaciers increase the risks of flooding and rock avalanches from destabilized slopes.\n*Climate change is projected to decrease [[freshwater]] availability in central, south, east and southeast Asia, particularly in large [[river basin]]s. With [[population growth]] and increasing demand from higher standards of living, this decrease could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s.\n*Increased [[flood]]ing from the sea and, in some cases, from rivers, threatens coastal areas, especially heavily populated delta regions in south, east, and southeast Asia.\n*By the mid-21st century, crop yields could increase up to 20% in east and southeast Asia. In the same period, yields could decrease up to 30% in central and south Asia.\n*Sickness and death due to [[diarrhoeal disease]] are projected to increase in east, south, and southeast Asia due to projected changes in the [[hydrological cycle]] associated with climate change.\n\n===Impacts on Europe===\n{{main|Climate change in Europe}}\n*Wide-ranging impacts of climate change have already been documented in [[Europe]]. These impacts include retreating glaciers, longer growing seasons, species range shifts, and heat wave-related health impacts.\n*Future impacts of climate change are projected to negatively affect nearly all European regions. Many economic sectors, such as agriculture and energy, could face challenges.\n*In southern Europe, higher temperatures and drought may reduce water availability, [[hydropower]] potential, summer [[tourism]], and crop productivity.\n*In central and eastern Europe, summer [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is projected to decrease, causing higher water stress. Forest productivity is projected to decline. The frequency of [[peatland]] fires is projected to increase.\n*In northern Europe, climate change is initially projected to bring mixed effects, including some benefits such as reduced demand for heating, increased crop yields, and increased forest growth. However, as climate change continues, negative impacts are likely to outweigh benefits. These include more frequent winter floods, endangered ecosystems, and increasing ground instability.\n\n==={{anchor|South America}}Impacts on South America===\n{{further|Climate change in Brazil}}\n*By mid-century, increases in temperature and decreases in soil moisture are projected to cause savanna to gradually replace tropical forest in the eastern [[Amazon basin]].\n*In drier areas, climate change will likely worsen drought, leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]] (increased salt content) and desertification (land degradation) of agricultural land. The productivity of [[livestock]] and some important crops such as [[maize]] and [[coffee]] are projected to decrease, with adverse consequences for [[food security]].

Some of the coldest places on Earth, such as the dry valleys of Antarctica, lack significant ice or snow coverage due to a lack of snow.

The Cobra shared the proven transmission, rotor system, and the T53 turboshaft engine of the UH-1 \"Huey\".<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald, David: ''Modern Battlefield Warplanes''. AIRtime Publishing Inc, 2004. {{ISBN|1-880588-76-5}}</ref>\n\nBy June 1967, the first AH-1G HueyCobras had been delivered. Originally designated as UH-1H, the \"A\" for attack designation was soon adopted and when the improved UH-1D became the UH-1H, the HueyCobra became the AH-1G.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>  Bell built 1,116 AH-1Gs for the US Army between 1967 and 1973, and the Cobras chalked up over a million operational hours in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>\n\nThe US Army purchased the AH-1G as an \"interim type\" for the \"jungle fighting\" role, but the Army's broader concern was the task of protecting Western Europe from the legions of Warsaw Pact armor to the east.<ref name=\"Vectorsite\">Goebel, Greg. [http://www.vectorsite.net/avcobra_1.html#m4 Model 309 KingCobra / Model 409 AAH (YAH-63)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807001809/http://www.vectorsite.net/avcobra_1.html |date=2007-08-07 }}. Vectorsite, 1 December 2008</ref>\n\nThe Army had initiated the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program to develop the [[Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne]] for the anti-tank gunship role, but development of the Cheyenne did not go smoothly, and as one writer put it, \"the vultures began to gather\", with Sikorsky and Bell trying to sell unsolicited alternatives to the Army. The Sikorsky offering was the [[Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk|S-67 Blackhawk]], a sleek gunship, which despite the name was no real relation to the later S-70 Black Hawk utility-transport helicopter. The Bell offering was a refined HueyCobra, the Model 309 KingCobra.<ref name=\"Vectorsite\"/>\n\n===KingCobra program===\nBell announced the KingCobra program in January 1971. Two prototypes were built, one with a P&WC T400-CP-400 Twin Pac dual turboshaft engine system much like that used on the AH-1J, but with a stronger drivetrain allowing operation at full 1,800 shp (1,340&nbsp;kW) power, and the other with a single [[Lycoming T55|Lycoming T55-L-7C]] turboshaft engine rated at 2,000 shp (1,490&nbsp;kW).<ref name=\"Vectorsite\"/>\n\nThe twin-engine KingCobra first flew on 10 September 1971. It looked much like an AH-1J, except for a longer and distinctive \"buzzard beak\" nose and a ventral fin like that on the original Model 209 demonstrator.<ref name=\"Huey_Cobra\">Bishop, Chris. ''Huey Cobra Gunships''. Osprey Publishing, 2006. {{ISBN|1-84176-984-3}}.</ref> However, there were significant changes that were less noticeable:\n*The airframe was strengthened and the tailboom was lengthened,<ref name=\"Huey_Cobra\" /> making the KingCobra {{convert|3|ft|7|in|m}} longer than the AH-1G.\n*A new rotor was fitted, with forward swept tips and a diameter of {{convert|48|ft|m}}, compared to {{convert|44|ft|m}} for the AH-1G. The new rotor blades improved lift and reduced noise.<ref name=\"Huey_Cobra\" />\n*A larger 20 millimeter ammunition drum, derived from the General Dynamics F-111, was fitted, which required a deeper fuselage.<ref name=\"Verier_p99\">Verier 1990, pp. 99, 103.</ref>\n*A sensor system for night and bad weather fighting was fitted beneath the extended nose. This Stabilized Multisensor Sight (SMS) was derived from technology developed for the AH-56 Cheyenne, and included a [[forward looking infrared|FLIR]], a low-light television (LLTV), a [[laser rangefinder]], and a missile guidance system. The SMS could display imagery on either the gunner's sight or the pilot's head-up display (HUD). The pilot had his own LLTV, mounted in the front of the rotor fairing, to allow him to fly while the gunner hunted for targets.<ref name=\"Vectorsite\"/>\n\nNew avionics were incorporated, including a Litton inertial navigation system (INS) that could store 16 different preprogrammed navigation waypoints; a radar altimeter with a ground warning system; and other improved navigation and communications gear.<ref name=\"Vectorsite\"/>\n\nThe primary weapon of the KingCobra was to be the new wire-guided [[BGM-71 TOW]] anti-tank missile, which had proven highly effective in combat test firings in Vietnam from Huey gunships. This weapon could be carried in a pack of four missiles, with one pack under each stub wing for a total of eight missiles. On launch, the TOW trailed out wires to communicate command guidance updates. The missile had two infrared flares on its tail to allow the SMS to track it. All the gunner had to do was keep the target in his sight, and the missile fire control system adjusted its flight appropriately. Both the gunner and the pilot had Sperry Univac helmet-mounted sights to allow them to acquire targets for the KingCobra's missiles and gun.<ref name=\"Vectorsite\"/>\n\nA long-span \"big wing\", {{convert|13|ft|m}} wide, was designed for the KingCobra, but apparently never fitted except as a static mockup. The \"big wing\" was to provide additional fuel and stores carriage capability at the wingtips.<ref name=\"Verier_p99\"/>\n\n===Flight testing and evaluation===\nThe single-engine KingCobra first flew in January 1972. Other than engine fit, it was almost identical to the twin-engine KingCobra. As it turned out, the single-engine prototype was wrecked in an accident in April, and to complete US Army evaluation the twin-engine KingCobra was modified to the single-engine configuration. The evaluation, which pitted the KingCobra against the Lockheed Cheyenne and Sikorsky S-67 in a competitive fly-off, began in the spring of 1972 and was completed in July. In August, the Army rejected all three to everyone's surprise.<ref name=\"Vectorsite\"/><ref>Verier 1990, p. 138.</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nMany of the sensors and subsystems used on the 309 were years ahead of their time.

The episode, at the time of its writing and production, was created to be a possible series finale if the show was not renewed for a final season.  As such, the episode not only resolves many of the plot lines introduced for the fourth season, but also several long-running plots throughout the show's run. In the episode, the Fringe division learns that Walter Bishop's old colleague, William Bell, has been in control of David Robert Jones' actions to collapse both universes in an attempt to create a new universe under his own control, and the Fringe team must make sacrifices to put an end to Bell's plans.\n\nBoth parts were co-written by [[Jeff Pinkner]], [[J. H. Wyman]], and [[Akiva Goldsman]]. [[Joe Chappelle]] served as director.  [[Leonard Nimoy]], though having previously stated his retirement from acting, reprised his role of [[William Bell (Fringe)|Dr. William Bell]]. [[Rebecca Mader]] also guest starred as Jessica Holt, a person-of-interest to Fringe division.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part one===\nSeveral people in an office complex suddenly exhibit signs of [[spontaneous combustion]] and die; others witnessing it realize that the symptom is onset by movement and stand perfectly still as help arrives. As Fringe division investigates, they find a device planted in the building's escalator system that released [[nanite]]s into those that rode it, triggering the combustion by body movement. One survivor, Jessica ([[Rebecca Mader]]), offers to be a test subject for Walter ([[John Noble]]) as he tries to discover a cure. When Jessica's body temperature starts to rapidly rise before the cure is synthesized, Olivia ([[Anna Torv]]) uses her Cortexiphan abilities to slow Jessica's system, which stops the nanites and allows Peter ([[Joshua Jackson]]) to inject the cure into her system.\n\nThe Fringe team finds that David Robert Jones ([[Jared Harris]]) had planted the device, and worry that despite the deactivation of the bridge, he is still trying to collapse both universes to create a third one. Walter studies the design of the device and recognizes that the nanites were not developed by Jones but by William Bell ([[Leonard Nimoy]]), and begins to suspect Bell is alive. Nina Sharp ([[Blair Brown]]) rejects this theory, explaining that, in the new timeline, Bell had committed suicide in a car accident in 2005 to end his suffering from [[lymphoma]]. Disbelieving Nina, Walter returns to St. Claire's Mental Institution and finds the scent of Bell in one of the log books that dated back to when Walter believed he had visited, and continues to assert this claim.\n\nUnknown to Fringe division, Jones reports to William Bell aboard the container ship (seen in \"[[Nothing As It Seems (Fringe)|Nothing As It Seems]]\") that Olivia and team have created a cure for the nanites. Bell references a chess game that he has been playing for 40 years that a winning move doesn't mean winning the game. He explains that the art of chess is to be willing to sacrifice one's most valuable piece to open up opportunity. He remarks that he needs to sacrifice the bishop to win the game.\n\nLater, a column of light suddenly appears over [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], burning a hole through a building and into the ground. Walter identifies it as sunlight, reflected to satellites likely under Jones' control, aimed to ignite an oil reservoir deep below [[Boston]]. He directs Peter and Olivia to the most likely location Jones is controlling the satellites from. They find two antennas that must be disabled simultaneously, requiring them to split up to do so. Though they are successful in stopping the beam, Peter is attacked by Jones. Olivia utilizes her Cortexiphan abilities again, and is able to [[Telekinesis|telekinetically]] control Peter's body, allowing him to get the upper hand, throwing Jones into one of the antennas. The electrical shock causes Jones' body, previously altered by his teleportation, to disintegrate, and he realizes too late that he was the bishop to be sacrificed before crumbling into ash.\n\nWalter discovers evidence of Chilean almonds on one of the log sheets from St. Claire's, Bell's favorite food. He and Astrid ([[Jasika Nicole]]) travel to the warehouse of the shipping company that imported the almonds, finding it abandoned with one man, armed with a gun, stating the company went out of business three years prior. Astrid implores Walter to leave, but he is enticed by a strange sound from the back of the warehouse, finding several shipping containers being moved about with the noises coming from them. They are discovered by henchmen and attempt fleeing. Astrid is shot, and as Walter tends to her, William Bell appears, reintroducing himself to his old friend.\n\n===Part two===\nOlivia (Torv) and Peter (Jackson) return to Walter's (Noble) laboratory, finding both him and Astrid (Nicole) missing. As they try to discover their whereabouts, Olivia receives a call from Jessica (Mader), believing that someone is following her. They are unaware that September ([[Michael Cerveris]]) has arrived at Jessica's house, but finds himself stuck to a \"stasis rune\" written into the floor preventing him from moving; by the time Olivia and Peter arrive, Jessica and a section of the floor with the rune have gone missing.\n\nBroyles ([[Lance Reddick]]) reports that Astrid has been taken to a local hospital and is faring well. She is worried for Walter's safety, warning them of Bell's (Nimoy) presence, and directing them to the warehouse. There, they find September still stuck on the piece of floor, and Jessica holding him at gunpoint. She reveals she is working for Bell, purposely endangered by the nanites to attract Fringe and the Observers' attention. She attempts to kill September with a typical gun, but September is able to catch the bullets in his hand. Jessica was aware of the Observers' reflexes, and then uses a specially designed gun that fires quicker than September can react, and the bullet strikes him in the chest. When she tries to fire again, Olivia is able to psychokinetically catch and repel the bullets back into Jessica, killing her.\n\nPeter is able to release September from the rune. Olivia recognizes the wound from the time September appeared to her at the opera house and told her that in every future he witnessed, Olivia would die (as seen in \"[[Back to Where You've Never Been]]\"). September reveals that to him, this conversation has not yet happened, and departs to investigate why he would say that to Olivia.\n\nPeter races Jessica's body back to Walter's lab, and with Nina's (Brown) help and resources from Massive Dynamic, connects her brain to equipment to briefly give her consciousness to determine Bell's location. Her answers are vague and cryptic but reveal that Bell is on a boat, and seeking a power source to collapse the two universes. Olivia goes to grip Jessica, shorting out power in the laboratory. Nina realizes that Olivia is Bell's power source; Jones' activities have been to invigorate Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to start the collapse of the two universes. Nina is able to use Olivia's electromagnetic readings to locate Bell's ship. The Fringe team sets off for Bell's boat on helicopters as initial signs of the final collapse begin to occur around the world.\n\nMeanwhile, aboard his boat, Bell has shown Walter his vision for the new universe, using the creatures stowed aboard it to populate his ideal world. Bell reveals that he was set on to this path by Walter in the past after Walter had lost both Peters and desired to play God himself. Walter rejected the idea then, asking Bell to remove pieces of his brain to quell the idea, but Bell continued to follow on Walter's vision, culminating in the current events.\n\nThe Fringe team approaches where Bell's freighter appears to be, but find that it has already become in sync with the other universe and only observable by Peter. Olivia is able to use her Cortexiphan abilities to cross over with Peter onto the freighter in mid-jump from the helicopter. They raid the cabin where Bell and Walter are. Peter attempts to stop Bell, but Bell asserts that the process is irreversible due to Olivia's powers. Walter then turns to Olivia and shoots her in the head with a handgun, completely disrupting the collapse. His plan ruined, Bell rings a bell and fades away as Walter hesitates to shoot him. Walter races to extract the bullet from Olivia, recognizing that the Cortexiphan should be able to regenerate the tissue and allow her to live.\n\nBell's freighter and biological experiments are stored away, and the US Government grants Broyles' request for a funding increase, as well as a promotion to general. Olivia makes a full recovery, though Walter suspects that her Cortexiphan powers will be stunted by the process. As she and Peter hug, she also reveals that she is pregnant with their child. Sometime later, as Walter prepares a snack in his lab, September appears before him, telling him, \"We have to warn the others. They are coming,\" referring to hostile Observers from the future (as seen in \"[[Letters of Transit]]\").<ref name=\"tvguide s5\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/Fringe-Postmortem-Season5-Spoilers-1047429.aspx | title = Fringe Postmortem: What's in Store for the Fifth and Final Season? | first = Natalie | last = Abrams | date = 2012-05-12 | accessdate  = 2012-05-12 | work = [[TV Guide]] }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Leonard Nimoy by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] returned as [[William Bell (Fringe)|Dr. William Bell]] in \"Brave New World\".]]\n\"Brave New World\" was co-written by co-showrunners [[J.H.

The episode, at the time of its writing and production, was created to be a possible series finale if the show was not renewed for a final season.  As such, the episode not only resolves many of the plot lines introduced for the fourth season, but also several long-running plots throughout the show's run. In the episode, the Fringe division learns that Walter Bishop's old colleague, William Bell, has been in control of David Robert Jones' actions to collapse both universes in an attempt to create a new universe under his own control, and the Fringe team must make sacrifices to put an end to Bell's plans.\n\nBoth parts were co-written by [[Jeff Pinkner]], [[J. H. Wyman]], and [[Akiva Goldsman]]. [[Joe Chappelle]] served as director.  [[Leonard Nimoy]], though having previously stated his retirement from acting, reprised his role of [[William Bell (Fringe)|Dr. William Bell]]. [[Rebecca Mader]] also guest starred as Jessica Holt, a person-of-interest to Fringe division.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part one===\nSeveral people in an office complex suddenly exhibit signs of [[spontaneous combustion]] and die; others witnessing it realize that the symptom is onset by movement and stand perfectly still as help arrives. As Fringe division investigates, they find a device planted in the building's escalator system that released [[nanite]]s into those that rode it, triggering the combustion by body movement. One survivor, Jessica ([[Rebecca Mader]]), offers to be a test subject for Walter ([[John Noble]]) as he tries to discover a cure. When Jessica's body temperature starts to rapidly rise before the cure is synthesized, Olivia ([[Anna Torv]]) uses her Cortexiphan abilities to slow Jessica's system, which stops the nanites and allows Peter ([[Joshua Jackson]]) to inject the cure into her system.\n\nThe Fringe team finds that David Robert Jones ([[Jared Harris]]) had planted the device, and worry that despite the deactivation of the bridge, he is still trying to collapse both universes to create a third one. Walter studies the design of the device and recognizes that the nanites were not developed by Jones but by William Bell ([[Leonard Nimoy]]), and begins to suspect Bell is alive. Nina Sharp ([[Blair Brown]]) rejects this theory, explaining that, in the new timeline, Bell had committed suicide in a car accident in 2005 to end his suffering from [[lymphoma]]. Disbelieving Nina, Walter returns to St. Claire's Mental Institution and finds the scent of Bell among one of the log books that dated back to when Walter believed he had visited, and continues to assert this claim.\n\nUnknown to Fringe division, Jones reports to William Bell aboard the container ship (seen in \"[[Nothing As It Seems (Fringe)|Nothing As It Seems]]\") that Olivia and team have created a cure for the nanites. Bell references a chess game that he has been playing for 40 years that a winning move doesn't mean winning the game. He explains that the art of chess is to be willing to sacrifice one's most valuable piece to open up opportunity. He remarks that he needs to sacrifice the bishop to win the game.\n\nLater, a column of light suddenly appears over [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], burning a hole through a building and into the ground. Walter identifies it as sunlight, reflected to satellites likely under Jones' control, aimed to ignite an oil reservoir deep below [[Boston]]. He directs Peter and Olivia to the most likely location Jones is controlling the satellites from. They find two antennas that must be disabled simultaneously, requiring them to split up to do so. Though they are successful in stopping the beam, Peter is attacked by Jones. Olivia utilizes her Cortexiphan abilities again, and is able to [[Telekinesis|telekinetically]] control Peter's body, allowing him to get the upper hand, throwing Jones into one of the antennas. The electrical shock causes Jones' body, previously altered by his teleportation, to disintegrate, and he realizes too late that he was the bishop to be sacrificed before crumbling into ash.\n\nWalter discovers evidence of Chilean almonds on one of the log sheets from St. Claire's, Bell's favorite food. He and Astrid ([[Jasika Nicole]]) travel to the warehouse of the shipping company that imported the almonds, finding it abandoned with one man, armed with a gun, stating the company went out of business three years prior. Astrid implores Walter to leave, but he is enticed by a strange sound from the back of the warehouse, finding several shipping containers being moved about with the noises coming from them. They are discovered by henchmen and attempt fleeing. Astrid is shot, and as Walter tends to her, William Bell appears, reintroducing himself to his old friend.\n\n===Part two===\nOlivia (Torv) and Peter (Jackson) return to Walter's (Noble) laboratory, finding both him and Astrid (Nicole) missing. As they try to discover their whereabouts, Olivia receives a call from Jessica (Mader), believing that someone is following her. They are unaware that September ([[Michael Cerveris]]) has arrived at Jessica's house, but finds himself stuck to a \"stasis rune\" written into the floor preventing him from moving; by the time Olivia and Peter arrive, Jessica and a section of the floor with the rune have gone missing.\n\nBroyles ([[Lance Reddick]]) reports that Astrid has been taken to a local hospital and is faring well. She is worried for Walter's safety, warning them of Bell's (Nimoy) presence, and directing them to the warehouse. There, they find September still stuck on the piece of floor, and Jessica holding him at gunpoint. She reveals she is working for Bell, purposely endangered by the nanites to attract Fringe and the Observers' attention. She attempts to kill September with a typical gun, but September is able to catch the bullets in his hand. Jessica was aware of the Observers' reflexes, and then uses a specially designed gun that fires quicker than September can react, and the bullet strikes him in the chest. When she tries to fire again, Olivia is able to psychokinetically catch and repel the bullets back into Jessica, killing her.\n\nPeter is able to release September from the rune. Olivia recognizes the wound from the time September appeared to her at the opera house and told her that in every future he witnessed, Olivia would die (as seen in \"[[Back to Where You've Never Been]]\"). September reveals that to him, this conversation has not yet happened, and departs to investigate why he would say that to Olivia.\n\nPeter races Jessica's body back to Walter's lab, and with Nina's (Brown) help and resources from Massive Dynamic, connects her brain to equipment to briefly give her consciousness to determine Bell's location. Her answers are vague and cryptic but reveal that Bell is on a boat, and seeking a power source to collapse the two universes. Olivia goes to grip Jessica, shorting out power in the laboratory. Nina realizes that Olivia is Bell's power source; Jones' activities have been to invigorate Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to start the collapse of the two universes. Nina is able to use Olivia's electromagnetic readings to locate Bell's ship. The Fringe team sets off for Bell's boat on helicopters as initial signs of the final collapse begin to occur around the world.\n\nMeanwhile, aboard his boat, Bell has shown Walter his vision for the new universe, using the creatures stowed aboard it to populate his ideal world. Bell reveals that he was set on to this path by Walter in the past after Walter had lost both Peters and desired to play God himself. Walter rejected the idea then, asking Bell to remove pieces of his brain to quell the idea, but Bell continued to follow on Walter's vision, culminating in the current events.\n\nThe Fringe team approaches where Bell's freighter appears to be, but find that it has already become in sync with the other universe and only observable by Peter. Olivia is able to use her Cortexiphan abilities to cross over with Peter onto the freighter in mid-jump from the helicopter. They raid the cabin where Bell and Walter are. Peter attempts to stop Bell, but Bell asserts that the process is irreversible due to Olivia's powers. Walter then turns to Olivia and shoots her in the head with a handgun, completely disrupting the collapse. His plan ruined, Bell rings a bell and fades away as Walter hesitates to shoot him. Walter races to extract the bullet from Olivia, recognizing that the Cortexiphan should be able to regenerate the tissue and allow her to live.\n\nBell's freighter and biological experiments are stored away, and the US Government grants Broyles' request for a funding increase, as well as a promotion to general. Olivia makes a full recovery, though Walter suspects that her Cortexiphan powers will be stunted by the process. As she and Peter hug, she also reveals that she is pregnant with their child. Sometime later, as Walter prepares a snack in his lab, September appears before him, telling him, \"We have to warn the others. They are coming,\" referring to hostile Observers from the future (as seen in \"[[Letters of Transit]]\").<ref name=\"tvguide s5\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/Fringe-Postmortem-Season5-Spoilers-1047429.aspx | title = Fringe Postmortem: What's in Store for the Fifth and Final Season? | first = Natalie | last = Abrams | date = 2012-05-12 | accessdate  = 2012-05-12 | work = [[TV Guide]] }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Leonard Nimoy by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] returned as [[William Bell (Fringe)|Dr. William Bell]] in \"Brave New World\".]]\n\"Brave New World\" was co-written by co-showrunners [[J.H.

{"title_page": "Games behind", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Game in hand}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A partial view of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], with standings for the [[American League East]] division, including a \"GB\" column]]\nIn most North American sports, the phrase '''games behind''' or '''games back''' (often abbreviated '''GB''') is a common way to reflect the gap between a leading team and another team in a sports league, conference, or division.\n\n==Example==\nIn the below standings from the [[1994 Major League Baseball season]], the [[Atlanta Braves]] are six ''games behind'' the [[Montreal Expos]]. Atlanta would have to win six games, and Montreal would have to lose six games, to tie for first. The leading team is zero games behind itself, and this is indicated in standings by a dash, not a zero.\n<center>{{1994 NL East standings}}</center>\n\n==Computing games behind==\nGames behind is calculated by using either of the following formulas, in which Team A is a leading team, and Team B is a trailing team. Example math in this section uses the above standings, with Montreal as Team A and Atlanta as Team B.\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{Team A's wins \u2013 Team A's losses}) - (\\text{Team B's wins \u2013 Team B's losses})}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{74 \u2013 40}) - (\\text{68 \u2013 46})}{2} = \\frac{\\text{34 \u2013 22}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6</math>\n\nAlternately:\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{Team A's wins \u2013 Team B's wins}) + (\\text{Team B's losses \u2013 Team A's losses})}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{74 \u2013 68}) + (\\text{46 \u2013 40})}{2} = \\frac{\\text{6 + 6}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6</math>\n\nNotes:\n* It can alternately be said that Montreal is six ''games ahead'' of Atlanta.\n* A games behind situation can change rapidly when two teams contesting for the lead play each other. For example, Atlanta could cut Montreal's lead in half (to three games) by sweeping a three-game head-to-head series.\n* The leading team, in terms of games behind, is the team with the best won\u2013loss ''difference''. This is not always the team with the most wins. For example, a team with an 80\u201370 record (10 more wins than losses) would be one game behind a team with a 79\u201367 record (12 more wins than losses).\n\n==Anomalies==\nThe formulas implicitly treat any difference in the number of games played by the two teams as each unplayed game being \"worth\" 0.5 wins and 0.5 losses. This can lead to anomalies when teams have played an unequal number of games, especially during the early portion of a season.\n\n* Two teams with different [[winning percentage]]s may be tied in terms of games behind. For example, Team A at 6\u20134 would be tied with Team B at 4\u20132, in terms of games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.\n* A team with a lower winning percentage may lead (in terms of games behind) a team with a higher winning percentage. For example, Team A at 6\u20134 would lead Team B at 2\u20131 by a half-game when calculating games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage at .667, compared to .600 for Team A.\n\n::An example of this occurred in May 2018, when the [[New York Yankees]] were 28\u201313 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] were 30\u201314. The ''games behind'' calculation had New York a half-game behind Boston; however, New York had the better winning percentage, at .683 compared to .682 for Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=2018&month=05&day=17 |title=MLB Scores and Standings |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |date=May 17, 2018 |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n::Also, on December 28, 2018, in the [[National Basketball Association]], the 24\u201310 [[Milwaukee Bucks]] were a half-game behind the 26\u201311 [[Toronto Raptors]]. Yet the Bucks were ranked first in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], their .706 win percentage superior to the Raptors\u2019 .703.\n\nLeagues generally use winning percentage to order teams, so in both of the above examples Team B would be considered to be in first place.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:NBA_Standings_29Nov1965.png|thumb|right|NBA standings in November 1965 as published in ''[[Star Tribune|The Minneapolis Star]]'']]\nThe games behind calculation is often used in professional [[baseball]] and [[basketball]], where tie games are not permitted. [[Standings]] for these sports appearing in print or online during a season usually will have teams ordered by winning percentages, with a \"GB\" column provided as a convenience to the reader. Games behind is used less often in [[American football]], where ties are possible but relatively uncommon. Games behind is rarely used in [[ice hockey]] and [[Association football|soccer]], where ties are traditionally common and standings points are typically used.\n\n===Major League Baseball===\n[[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) defines games behind as \"the average of the differences between the leading team wins and the trailing team wins, and the leading teams losses and the trailing team losses.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/?tcid=mm_mlb_standings |title=Standings |date=April 5, 2010 |website=[[MLB.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405085954/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/?tcid=mm_mlb_standings |archivedate=April 5, 2010 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref> A games behind column almost always appears in MLB standings for each five-team division.\n\n====Wild card race====\nIn the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 MLB season]], the [[American League]] and [[National League]] each split into three divisions, and each added a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team to the playoffs. Following this change, it became common for the media to publish an additional set of standings for the wild card race. It included all teams from a league, with the exception of the division leaders, and games behind was calculated with respect to the team with the highest standing in the wild card race.\n\nIn the [[2012 Major League Baseball season|2012 MLB season]], both leagues added a second wild card team. Now, games behind in the wild card race is calculated with respect to the team with ''second highest'' standing in the wild card race. MLB's website distinguishes this statistic as ''wild card games behind'', abbreviated WCGB. Assuming that teams are not tied for first place in the wild card race, this results in the team leading the wild card race being shown as some number of \"games ahead\" of the second place team, indicated by a plus sign (\"+\") in the standings. As an example, see the [[:Template:2012 NL Wild Card standings|2012 NL Wild Card standings]], which shows the [[Atlanta Braves]] six games ahead of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n===National Basketball Association===\n[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) standings typically report games behind within each five-team division. However, it is not as closely followed as in baseball, because more teams qualify for the NBA playoffs, and the divisional statistics are not as important for playoff qualification. Sometimes, especially nearing the end of the regular season, games behind will be given with respect to the eighth position in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], as the eighth position is the last to qualify for the playoffs in each conference.\n\n===National Football League===\n[[File:NFL_Standings_23Oct1972.png|thumb|right|NFL standings in October 1972 as published in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'']]\n[[National Football League]] (NFL) standings sometimes report games behind, although the statistic is not emphasized; winning percentage is used, computed from each team's win\u2013loss\u2013tie record. This is especially true since the introduction of the bye week in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], exacerbating differences in the number of games that teams have played at various points in time. Games behind is omitted from standings on the NFL's website and is absent from most published standings.\n\n===Other sports===\nThe games behind statistic is eschewed in sports where tie games are traditionally common, such as the [[ice hockey]] and [[soccer]]. Leagues in these sports typically rank teams by awarding a certain number of points for each win or tie. In competitions where ties have been abolished (especially in hockey), points are still awarded for an \"overtime loss\" such that they are often (but not always) the same value as ties previously were, while in soccer the traditional value of two points for a win has been replaced by three points, while ties are still worth one point. These changes would make calculating a \"games behind\" statistic even more complicated compared to if it were to be used under the traditional system in which a tie was effectively worth a \"half-win.\"\n\nThe [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also does not use games behind, and awards standings points. However, unlike leagues such as the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) the CFL does not award points for overtime losses, although it experimented with such a system in the early 21st century. Also, unlike most other football codes which use a point system the CFL still uses the traditional values of two points for a win and one for a tie. Therefore, a tie in the CFL is still effectively worth a \"half-win\" as it always has been in [[Canadian football]] (and also as it has been in the NFL since 1972).\n\n===Related usage===\nTeams are sometimes referred to as being over or under \"five hundred\", in comparison to a [[Winning percentage#500|.500]] winning percentage. The calculation for this is simple subtraction (there is no division by two).  For example, a team at 55\u201350 is \"five games over five hundred\", while a team at 40\u201350 would be \"ten games under five hundred\". 'Above' and 'below' can be substituted for 'over' and 'under', respectively.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Magic number (sports)]], the number of wins needed to clinch a championship\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=gb GB glossary entry] at baseballprospectus.com\n\n[[Category:Sports terminology]]\n[[Category:Sports records and statistics]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Game in hand}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A partial view of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], with standings for the [[American League East]] division, including a \"GB\" column]]\nIn most North American sports, the phrase '''games behind''' or '''games back''' (often abbreviated '''GB''') is a common way to reflect the gap between a leading team and another team in a sports league, conference, or division.\n\n==Example==\nIn the below standings from the [[1994 Major League Baseball season]], the [[Atlanta Braves]] are six ''games behind'' the [[Montreal Expos]].

Other features included were a personal firewall, email spam filtering, and phishing protection.\n\n=== Norton 360 (2007) ===\n\n[[Norton 360]] was developed and marketed as an \"all-in-one\" [[computer security]] suite. The package included an antivirus program, a personal firewall, a phishing protection program, and a backup program. What distinguished this suite from Norton Internet Security was the inclusion of file backup and PC maintenance capabilities.\n\n=== Norton Clean Sweep (2009) ===\n\nNorton Clean Sweep was designed by [[Quarterdeck]] and designed to aid in the removal of installed programs on Microsoft Windows. [[CleanSweep]] was acquired by Symantec and sold as a standalone product for a period of time. It is currently unavailable from Symantec standalone and is incorporated in [[Norton SystemWorks]].\n\n== Product Reviews ==\n\n* TechAdvisor gave Norton Security with Backup a rating of 4.5 stars of 5.

For example, if <math display=\"inline\">A_1 \\times A_2</math> exists, then there are unique morphisms <math display=\"inline\">i_k: A_k \\to A_1 \\times A_2</math> such that\n\n*<math>p_k \\circ i_k = 1_{A_k},\\ (k = 1, 2)</math>\n*<math>p_l \\circ i_k = 0 </math> for <math display=\"inline\">k \\neq l.</math>\n\nTo see that <math display=\"inline\">A_1 \\times A_2</math> is now also a coproduct, and hence a biproduct, suppose we have morphisms <math display=\"inline\">f_k: A_k \\to X,\\ k=1,2</math> for some object <math display=\"inline\">X</math>. Define <math display=\"inline\">f := f_1 \\circ p_1 + f_2 \\circ p_2.</math> Then <math display=\"inline\">f</math> is a morphism from <math display=\"inline\">A_1 \\times A_2</math> to <math display=\"inline\">X</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">f \\circ i_k = f_k</math> for <math display=\"inline\">k = 1, 2</math>.\n\nIn this case we always have\n*<math display=\"inline\">i_1 \\circ p_1 + i_2 \\circ p_2 = 1_{A_1 \\times A_2}.</math>\n\nAn [[additive category]] is a [[preadditive category]] in which all finite biproducts exist.

Define <math display=\"inline\">f := f_1 \\circ p_1 + f_2 \\circ p_2.</math> Then <math display=\"inline\">f: A_1 \\times A_2 \\to X</math> is a morphism and <math display=\"inline\">f \\circ i_k = f_k</math>.\n\nIn this case we always have\n*<math display=\"inline\">i_1 \\circ p_1 + i_2 \\circ p_2 = 1_{A_1 \\times A_2}.</math>\n\nAn [[additive category]] is a [[preadditive category]] in which all finite biproducts exist.

For example, Danish has a [[suprasegmental]] feature known as [[st\u00f8d]] which is a kind of laryngeal phonation that is used phonemically. It also exhibits extensive [[lenition]] of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages. Because of that and a few other things, spoken Danish is rather hard to understand for Norwegians and Swedes, although they can easily read it.\n\n== Consonants ==\nDanish has at least 17 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!
