This is in distinction to [[permissive software license]]s, of which the [[BSD licenses]] and the [[MIT License]] are widely used less-restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.\n\nHistorically, the GPL license family has been one of the most popular software licenses in the [[free and open-source software]] domain.<ref name=\"blackduck2015\"/><ref name=\"redhat2000\"/><ref name=\"freecode2008\"/><ref name=\"mattasay2011\"/><ref name=\"waltervanholst2013\"/> Prominent free-software programs licensed under the GPL include the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC).

Over the following 15 years, members of the [[free software community]] became concerned over problems in the GPLv2 license that could let someone exploit GPL-licensed software in ways contrary to the license's intent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gplv3.fsf.org/rms-why.html | title=Why Upgrade to GPL Version 3 --GPLv3 | publisher=Fsf.org | accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> These problems included [[tivoization]] (the inclusion of GPL-licensed software in hardware that refuses to run modified versions of its software), compatibility issues similar to those of the [[Affero General Public License]]\u2014and patent deals between [[Microsoft]] and distributors of free and open-source software, which some viewed as an attempt to use patents as a weapon against the free software community.\n\nVersion 3 was developed to attempt to address these concerns and was officially released on 29 June 2007.<ref name=\"gpl3launch\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/news/gplv3_launched | title=FSF releases the GNU General Public License, version 3 \u2013 Free Software Foundation \u2013 working together for free software | publisher=Fsf.org | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Version 1 ===\n{{Infobox software license\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT \"FLESH OUT\" THE PARAMETERS HERE.

The first problem was that distributors may publish [[binary file]]s only\u2014executable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that copying and distributing copies or any portion of the program must also make the human-readable source code available under the same licensing terms.{{efn|text=Sections 3a and 3b of the license}}\n\nThe second problem was that distributors might add restrictions, either to the license, or by combining the software with other software that had other restrictions on distribution. The union of two sets of restrictions would apply to the combined work, thus adding unacceptable restrictions. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPLv1.{{efn|text=Sections 2b and 4 of the license}} Therefore, software distributed under the terms of GPLv1 could be combined with software under more permissive terms, as this would not change the terms under which the whole could be distributed. However, software distributed under GPLv1 could not be combined with software distributed under a more restrictive license, as this would conflict with the requirement that the whole be distributable under the terms of GPLv1.\n\n=== Version 2 ===\n{{Infobox software license\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT \"FLESH OUT\" THE PARAMETERS HERE.

The section says that licensees may distribute a GPL-covered work ''only'' if they can satisfy all of the license's obligations, despite any other legal obligations they might have. In other words, the obligations of the license may not be [[severability|severed]] due to conflicting obligations. This provision is intended to discourage any party from using a [[patent infringement]] claim or other litigation to impair users' freedom under the license.<ref name=\"gplv3conf\"/>\n\nBy 1990, it was becoming apparent that a less restrictive license would be strategically useful for the C library and for software libraries that essentially did the job of existing proprietary ones;<ref>For the reasoning see [https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html The GNU project].</ref><!-- It would be nice to have the original page instead of this newer one --> when version 2 of the GPL (GPLv2) was released in June 1991, therefore, a second license \u2013 the GNU Library General Public License \u2013 was introduced at the same time and numbered with version 2 to show that both were complementary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/library.html|title=GNU Library General Public License, version 2.0|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref> The version numbers diverged in 1999 when version 2.1 of the LGPL was released, which renamed it the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] to reflect its place in the philosophy.\n\nMost commonly \"GPLv2 or any later version\" is stated by users of the license, to allow upgrading to GPLv3.\n\n=== Version 3 ===\n{{Infobox software license\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT \"FLESH OUT\" THE PARAMETERS HERE.

The FSF argues that free software should not place restrictions on commercial use,<ref name=\"Selling Free Software\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html |title=Selling Free Software |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation}}</ref> and the GPL explicitly states that GPL works may be sold at any price.\n\nThe GPL additionally states that a distributor may not impose \"further restrictions on the rights granted by the GPL\".

The second section of version 2 and the fifth section of version 3 also require giving \"all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program\". Version 3 of the license allows making the source code available in additional ways in fulfillment of the seventh section. These include downloading source code from an adjacent network server or by peer-to-peer transmission, provided that is how the compiled code was available and there are \"clear directions\" on where to find the source code.\n\nThe FSF does not hold the copyright for a work released under the GPL, unless an author explicitly [[Copyright assignment|assigns copyrights]] to the FSF (which seldom happens except for programs that are part of the GNU project).

The [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU ''Lesser'' General Public license]] (LGPL) was created to have a weaker copyleft than the GPL, in that it does not require own custom-developed source code (distinct from the LGPLed parts) to be made available under the same license terms.\n\n=== Copyleft ===\n{{Main|Copyleft}}\n\nThe distribution rights granted by the GPL for modified versions of the work are not unconditional. When someone distributes a GPL'd work plus their own modifications, the requirements for distributing the whole work cannot be any greater than the requirements that are in the GPL.\n\nThis requirement is known as copyleft. It earns its legal power from the use of [[copyright]] on software programs. Because a GPL work is copyrighted, a licensee has no right to redistribute it, not even in modified form (barring [[fair use]]), except under the terms of the license. One is only required to adhere to the terms of the GPL if one wishes to exercise rights normally restricted by copyright law, such as redistribution. Conversely, if one distributes copies of the work without abiding by the terms of the GPL (for instance, by keeping the source code secret), they can be [[lawsuit|sued]] by the original author under copyright law.\n\nCopyleft thus uses copyright law to accomplish the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of imposing restrictions, it grants rights to other people, in a way that ensures the rights cannot subsequently be taken away. It also ensures that unlimited redistribution rights are not granted, should any legal flaw be found in the copyleft statement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nMany distributors of GPL'ed programs bundle the source code with the [[executable]]s. An alternative method of satisfying the copyleft is to provide a written offer to provide the source code on a physical medium (such as a CD) upon request. In practice, many GPL'ed programs are distributed over the Internet, and the source code is made available over [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]. For Internet distribution, this complies with the license.\n\nCopyleft applies only when a person seeks to redistribute the program. Developers may make private modified versions with no obligation to divulge the modifications, as long as they do not distribute the modified software to anyone else. Note that copyleft applies only to the software, and not to its output (unless that output is itself a derivative work of the program).{{efn|text=A counter example is the GPL'ed [[GNU Bison]]: the parsers it outputs ''do'' contain parts of itself and are therefore derivatives, which would fall under the GPL if not for a special exception granted by GNU Bison.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conditions for Using Bison |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Conditions.html |accessdate=11 December 2008 |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation}}</ref>}} For example, a public web portal running a modified derivative of a GPL'ed [[content management system]] is not required to distribute its changes to the underlying software, because its output is not a derivative.\n\nThere has been debate on whether it is a violation of the GPL to release the source code in [[obfuscation (software)|obfuscated]] form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available.

Different opinions exist on this issue. The GPL is clear in requiring that all [[derivative work]]s of code under the GPL must themselves be under the GPL. Ambiguity arises with regards to using GPL libraries, and bundling GPL software into a larger package (perhaps mixed into a binary via static linking). This is ultimately a question not of the GPL ''per se'', but of how copyright law defines derivative works. The following points of view exist:\n\n==== Point of view: dynamic and static linking violate GPL ====\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] (which holds the copyright of several notable GPL-licensed software products and of the license text itself) asserts that an executable which uses a dynamically linked library is indeed a derivative work. This does not however apply to separate programs communicating with one another.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html | title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses  (GPL FAQ) |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation | accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Free Software Foundation also created the [[LGPL]], which is nearly identical to the GPL, but with additional permissions to allow linking for the purposes of \"using the library\".\n\n[[Richard Stallman]] and the FSF specifically encourage library-writers to license under the GPL so that proprietary programs cannot use the libraries, in an effort to protect the free-software world by giving it more tools than the proprietary world.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html | title=Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation  | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Point of view: static linking violates GPL but unclear as of dynamic linking ====\nSome people believe that while [[static linking]] produces derivative works, it is not clear whether an executable that dynamically links to a GPL code should be considered a derivative work (see [[weak copyleft]]).

If not, then I would argue that it is not a derivative work,\"<ref name=Rosen /> and lists numerous other points regarding intent, bundling, and linkage mechanism.\nHe further argues on his firm's website<ref>Lawrence Rosen, [http://www.rosenlaw.com/lj19.htm Derivative Works], ''rosenlaw.com'' (25 May 2004)</ref> that such \"market-based\" factors are more important than the linking technique.\n\nThere is also the specific issue of whether a [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] or [[Modular programming|module]] (such as the [[NVidia]] or [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] [[graphics card]] [[kernel module]]s) must also be GPL, if it could reasonably be considered its own work. This point of view suggests that reasonably separate plugins, or plugins for software designed to use plugins, could be licensed under an arbitrary license if the work is GPLv2. Of particular interest is the GPLv2 paragraph:\n\n{{quote|\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:{{nbsp}}...\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.{{nbsp}}... These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n}}\n\nThe GPLv3 has a different clause:\n{{quote|\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of Section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:{{nbsp}}...\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable Section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.{{nbsp}}... A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n}}\n\nAs a case study, some supposedly proprietary [[plugins]] and [[theme (computing)|theme]]s/[[skin (computing)|skin]]s for GPLv2 [[Content management system|CMS]] software such as [[Drupal]] and [[WordPress]] have come under fire, with both sides of the argument taken.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.webmaster-source.com/2009/01/29/why-theyre-wrong-wordpress-plugins-shouldnt-have-to-be-gpl/ | title=Why They\u2019re Wrong: WordPress Plugins Shouldn\u2019t Have to be GPL | publisher=Webmaster-source.com | date=29 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}<br>{{cite web | url=http://drupal.org/licensing/faq#q7 | title=Licensing FAQ | publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe FSF differentiates on how the plugin is being invoked. If the plugin is invoked through dynamic linkage and it performs function calls to the GPL program then it is most likely a derivative work.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLPluginsInNF | title=GPL FAQ: Can I apply the GPL when writing a plug-in for a nonfree program?   |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation  | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Communicating and bundling with non-GPL programs ===\nThe mere act of communicating with other programs does not, by itself, require all software to be GPL; nor does distributing GPL software with non-GPL software. However, minor conditions must be followed that ensures the rights of GPL software is not restricted. The following is a quote from the [[gnu.org]] GPL [[FAQ]], which describes to what extent software is allowed to communicate with and be bundled with GPL programs:<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation MereAggregation] \"What constitutes combining two parts into one program? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).\" on gnu.org</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n''What is the difference between an \"aggregate\" and other kinds of \"modified versions\"?''\n\nAn \"aggregate\" consists of a number of separate programs, distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media. The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program's individual license would grant them.\n\nWhere's the line between two separate programs, and one program with two parts? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).\n\nIf the modules are included in the same executable file, they are definitely combined in one program. If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means combining them into one program.\n\nBy contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program.\n}}\n\nThe FSF thus draws the line between \"library\" and \"other program\" via 1) \"complexity\" and \"intimacy\" of information exchange, and 2) mechanism (rather than semantics), but resigns that the question is not clear-cut and that in complex situations, case law will decide.\n\n== Legal status ==\n{{see also|SCO-Linux controversies|SCO v.

Selling exceptions here means that the copyright holder of a given software releases it (along with the corresponding source code) to the public under a free software license, \"then lets customers pay for permission to use the same code under different terms, for instance allowing its inclusion in proprietary applications\". Stallman considered selling exceptions \"acceptable since the 1990s, and on occasion I've suggested it to companies. Sometimes this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software\". Despite the fact that the FSF doesn't practice selling exceptions, a comparison with the X11 license (which is a non-copyleft free software license) is proposed for suggesting that this commercialization technique should be regarded as ethically acceptable. Releasing a given program under a non-copyleft free software license would permit embedding the code in proprietary software. Stallman comments that \"either we have to conclude that it's wrong to release anything under the X11 license\u2014a conclusion I find unacceptably extreme\u2014or reject this implication. Using a noncopyleft license is weak, and usually an inferior choice, but it's not wrong. In other words, selling exceptions permits some embedding in proprietary software, and the X11 license permits even more embedding.

For instance one would think that the incompatibility of the GPLv2 with the Apache Software License 2.0 should be a thing of the past now that everything upgrades to GPLv3, but it turns out that enough people are either stuck with GPLv2 only or do not agree with the GPLv3 that some Apache Software licensed projects are required to migrate. For instance Twitter's Bootstrap is currently migrating from ASL2.0 to MIT precisely because some people still need GPLv2 compatibility. Among those projects that were affected were Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, the MoinMoin Wiki and others. And even that case shows that people don't care that much about licenses any more as Joomla 3 just bundled bootstrap even though they were not licenses in a compatible way (GPLv2 vs ASL 2.0). The other traditional case of things not being GPL compatible is the OpenSSL project which has a license that does not go well with the GPL. That license is also still incompatible with the GPLv3.

The first problem was that distributors may publish [[binary file]]s only\u2014executable, but not readable or modifiable by humans. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that copying and distributing copies or any portion of the program must also make the human-readable source code available under the same licensing terms.{{efn|text=Sections 3a and 3b of the license}}\n\nThe second problem was that distributors might add restrictions, either to the license, or by combining the software with other software that had other restrictions on distribution. The union of two sets of restrictions would apply to the combined work, thus adding unacceptable restrictions. To prevent this, GPLv1 stated that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPLv1.{{efn|text=Sections 2b and 4 of the license}} Therefore, software distributed under the terms of GPLv1 could be combined with software under more permissive terms, as this would not change the terms under which the whole could be distributed.

This provision is intended to discourage any party from using a [[patent infringement]] claim or other litigation to impair users' freedom under the license.<ref name=\"gplv3conf\"/>\n\nBy 1990, it was becoming apparent that a less restrictive license would be strategically useful for the C library and for software libraries that essentially did the job of existing proprietary ones;<ref>For the reasoning see [https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html The GNU project].</ref><!-- It would be nice to have the original page instead of this newer one --> when version 2 of the GPL (GPLv2) was released in June 1991, therefore, a second license \u2013 the GNU Library General Public License \u2013 was introduced at the same time and numbered with version 2 to show that both were complementary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/library.html|title=GNU Library General Public License, version 2.0|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref> The version numbers diverged in 1999 when version 2.1 of the LGPL was released, which renamed it the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] to reflect its place in the philosophy.\n\nMost commonly \"GPLv2 or any later version\" is stated by users of the license, to allow upgrading to GPLv3.\n\n=== Version 3 ===\n{{Infobox software license\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT \"FLESH OUT\" THE PARAMETERS HERE.

Any licensee who adheres to the terms and conditions is given permission to modify the work, as well as to copy and redistribute the work or any derivative version. The licensee is allowed to charge a fee for this service, or do this free of charge. This latter point distinguishes the GPL from software licenses that prohibit commercial redistribution. The FSF argues that free software should not place restrictions on commercial use,<ref name=\"Selling Free Software\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html |title=Selling Free Software |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation}}</ref> and the GPL explicitly states that GPL works may be sold at any price.\n\nThe GPL additionally states that a distributor may not impose \"further restrictions on the rights granted by the GPL\". This forbids activities such as distributing of the software under a non-disclosure agreement or contract.\n\nThe fourth section for version 2 of the license and the seventh section of version 3 require that programs distributed as pre-compiled binaries be accompanied by a copy of the source code, a written offer to distribute the source code via the same mechanism as the pre-compiled binary, or the written offer to obtain the source code that the user got when they received the pre-compiled binary under the GPL. The second section of version 2 and the fifth section of version 3 also require giving \"all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program\". Version 3 of the license allows making the source code available in additional ways in fulfillment of the seventh section. These include downloading source code from an adjacent network server or by peer-to-peer transmission, provided that is how the compiled code was available and there are \"clear directions\" on where to find the source code.\n\nThe FSF does not hold the copyright for a work released under the GPL, unless an author explicitly [[Copyright assignment|assigns copyrights]] to the FSF (which seldom happens except for programs that are part of the GNU project). Only the individual copyright holders have the authority to sue when a license violation is suspected.\n\n[[File:GPLstatements consumerentertainmentdevices.jpg|thumb|Printed GPL statements for [[consumer entertainment device]]s which incorporate GPL components]]\n\n=== Use of licensed software ===\nSoftware under the GPL may be run for all purposes, including commercial purposes and even as a tool for creating [[proprietary software]], such as when using GPL-licensed [[compiler]]s.<ref>{{cite web   |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#CanIUseGPLToolsForNF |title=GPL FAQ: Use GPL Tools to develop non-free programs?}}</ref> Users or companies who distribute GPL-licensed works (e.g. software), may charge a fee for copies or give them free of charge. This distinguishes the GPL from [[shareware]] software licenses that allow copying for personal use but prohibit commercial distribution, or proprietary licenses where copying is prohibited by [[copyright law]]. The FSF argues that freedom-respecting free software should also not restrict commercial use and distribution (including redistribution):<ref name=\"Selling Free Software\"/>\n\nIn purely private (or internal) use\u2014with no sales and no distribution\u2014the software code may be modified and parts reused without requiring the source code to be released.

The [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU ''Lesser'' General Public license]] (LGPL) was created to have a weaker copyleft than the GPL, in that it does not require own custom-developed source code (distinct from the LGPLed parts) to be made available under the same license terms.\n\n=== Copyleft ===\n{{Main|Copyleft}}\n\nThe distribution rights granted by the GPL for modified versions of the work are not unconditional. When someone distributes a GPL'd work plus their own modifications, the requirements for distributing the whole work cannot be any greater than the requirements that are in the GPL.\n\nThis requirement is known as copyleft. It earns its legal power from the use of [[copyright]] on software programs. Because a GPL work is copyrighted, a licensee has no right to redistribute it, not even in modified form (barring [[fair use]]), except under the terms of the license. One is only required to adhere to the terms of the GPL if one wishes to exercise rights normally restricted by copyright law, such as redistribution. Conversely, if one distributes copies of the work without abiding by the terms of the GPL (for instance, by keeping the source code secret), they can be [[lawsuit|sued]] by the original author under copyright law.\n\nCopyleft thus uses copyright law to accomplish the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of imposing restrictions, it grants rights to other people, in a way that ensures the rights cannot subsequently be taken away. It also ensures that unlimited redistribution rights are not granted, should any legal flaw be found in the copyleft statement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nMany distributors of GPL'ed programs bundle the source code with the [[executable]]s. An alternative method of satisfying the copyleft is to provide a written offer to provide the source code on a physical medium (such as a CD) upon request. In practice, many GPL'ed programs are distributed over the Internet, and the source code is made available over [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]. For Internet distribution, this complies with the license.\n\nCopyleft applies only when a person seeks to redistribute the program. Developers may make private modified versions with no obligation to divulge the modifications, as long as they do not distribute the modified software to anyone else. Note that copyleft applies only to the software, and not to its output (unless that output is itself a derivative work of the program).{{efn|text=A counter example is the GPL'ed [[GNU Bison]]: the parsers it outputs ''do'' contain parts of itself and are therefore derivatives, which would fall under the GPL if not for a special exception granted by GNU Bison.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conditions for Using Bison |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Conditions.html |accessdate=11 December 2008 |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation}}</ref>}} For example, a public web portal running a modified derivative of a GPL'ed [[content management system]] is not required to distribute its changes to the underlying software, because its output is not a derivative.\n\nThere has been debate on whether it is a violation of the GPL to release the source code in [[obfuscation (software)|obfuscated]] form, such as in cases in which the author is less willing to make the source code available.

Different opinions exist on this issue. The GPL is clear in requiring that all [[derivative work]]s of code under the GPL must themselves be under the GPL. Ambiguity arises with regards to using GPL libraries, and bundling GPL software into a larger package (perhaps mixed into a binary via static linking). This is ultimately a question not of the GPL ''per se'', but of how copyright law defines derivative works. The following points of view exist:\n\n==== Point of view: dynamic and static linking violate GPL ====\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] (which holds the copyright of several notable GPL-licensed software products and of the license text itself) asserts that an executable which uses a dynamically linked library is indeed a derivative work. This does not however apply to separate programs communicating with one another.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html | title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses  (GPL FAQ) |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation | accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Free Software Foundation also created the [[LGPL]], which is nearly identical to the GPL, but with additional permissions to allow linking for the purposes of \"using the library\".\n\n[[Richard Stallman]] and the FSF specifically encourage library-writers to license under the GPL so that proprietary programs cannot use the libraries, in an effort to protect the free-software world by giving it more tools than the proprietary world.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html | title=Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation  | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Point of view: static linking violates GPL but unclear as of dynamic linking ====\nSome people believe that while [[static linking]] produces derivative works, it is not clear whether an executable that dynamically links to a GPL code should be considered a derivative work (see [[weak copyleft]]). Linux author [[Linus Torvalds]] agrees that dynamic linking can create derived works but disagrees over the circumstances.<ref>Linus Torvalds, [https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/17/79 GPL only modules], ''linux-kernel'' mailing list (17 December 2006).</ref>\n\nA [[Novell]] lawyer has written that dynamic linking not being derivative \"makes sense\" but is not \"clear-cut\", and that evidence for good-intentioned dynamic linking can be seen by the existence of proprietary Linux kernel drivers.<ref>Matt Asay, [http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/1532.html The GPL: Understanding the License that Governs Linux], ''Novell Cool Solutions Feature'' (16 Jan 2004).</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Galoob v.

If not, then I would argue that it is not a derivative work,\"<ref name=Rosen /> and lists numerous other points regarding intent, bundling, and linkage mechanism.\nHe further argues on his firm's website<ref>Lawrence Rosen, [http://www.rosenlaw.com/lj19.htm Derivative Works], ''rosenlaw.com'' (25 May 2004)</ref> that such \"market-based\" factors are more important than the linking technique.\n\nThere is also the specific issue of whether a [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] or [[Modular programming|module]] (such as the [[NVidia]] or [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] [[graphics card]] [[kernel module]]s) must also be GPL, if it could reasonably be considered its own work. This point of view suggests that reasonably separate plugins, or plugins for software designed to use plugins, could be licensed under an arbitrary license if the work is GPLv2. Of particular interest is the GPLv2 paragraph:\n\n{{quote|\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:{{nbsp}}...\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.{{nbsp}}... These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n}}\n\nThe GPLv3 has a different clause:\n{{quote|\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of Section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:{{nbsp}}...\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable Section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.{{nbsp}}... A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n}}\n\nAs a case study, some supposedly proprietary [[plugins]] and [[theme (computing)|theme]]s/[[skin (computing)|skin]]s for GPLv2 [[Content management system|CMS]] software such as [[Drupal]] and [[WordPress]] have come under fire, with both sides of the argument taken.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.webmaster-source.com/2009/01/29/why-theyre-wrong-wordpress-plugins-shouldnt-have-to-be-gpl/ | title=Why They\u2019re Wrong: WordPress Plugins Shouldn\u2019t Have to be GPL | publisher=Webmaster-source.com | date=29 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2011}}<br>{{cite web | url=http://drupal.org/licensing/faq#q7 | title=Licensing FAQ | publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe FSF differentiates on how the plugin is being invoked. If the plugin is invoked through dynamic linkage and it performs function calls to the GPL program then it is most likely a derivative work.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLPluginsInNF | title=GPL FAQ: Can I apply the GPL when writing a plug-in for a nonfree program?   |website=GNU Project | publisher= Free Software Foundation  | accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Communicating and bundling with non-GPL programs ===\nThe mere act of communicating with other programs does not, by itself, require all software to be GPL; nor does distributing GPL software with non-GPL software. However, minor conditions must be followed that ensures the rights of GPL software is not restricted. The following is a quote from the [[gnu.org]] GPL [[FAQ]], which describes to what extent software is allowed to communicate with and be bundled with GPL programs:<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation MereAggregation] \"What constitutes combining two parts into one program? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).\" on gnu.org</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n''What is the difference between an \"aggregate\" and other kinds of \"modified versions\"?''\n\nAn \"aggregate\" consists of a number of separate programs, distributed together on the same CD-ROM or other media. The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the other software are non-free or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that each program's individual license would grant them.\n\nWhere's the line between two separate programs, and one program with two parts? This is a legal question, which ultimately judges will decide. We believe that a proper criterion depends both on the mechanism of communication (exec, pipes, rpc, function calls within a shared address space, etc.) and the semantics of the communication (what kinds of information are interchanged).\n\nIf the modules are included in the same executable file, they are definitely combined in one program. If modules are designed to run linked together in a shared address space, that almost surely means combining them into one program.\n\nBy contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules normally are separate programs. But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger program.\n}}\n\nThe FSF thus draws the line between \"library\" and \"other program\" via 1) \"complexity\" and \"intimacy\" of information exchange, and 2) mechanism (rather than semantics), but resigns that the question is not clear-cut and that in complex situations, case law will decide.\n\n== Legal status ==\n{{see also|SCO-Linux controversies|SCO v.

This is independent of the questions whether the licensing conditions of the GPL have been effectively agreed upon between plaintiff and defendant or not.

Selling exceptions here means that the copyright holder of a given software releases it (along with the corresponding source code) to the public under a free software license, \"then lets customers pay for permission to use the same code under different terms, for instance allowing its inclusion in proprietary applications\". Stallman considered selling exceptions \"acceptable since the 1990s, and on occasion I've suggested it to companies. Sometimes this approach has made it possible for important programs to become free software\". Despite the fact that the FSF doesn't practice selling exceptions, a comparison with the X11 license (which is a non-copyleft free software license) is proposed for suggesting that this commercialization technique should be regarded as ethically acceptable. Releasing a given program under a non-copyleft free software license would permit embedding the code in proprietary software. Stallman comments that \"either we have to conclude that it's wrong to release anything under the X11 license\u2014a conclusion I find unacceptably extreme\u2014or reject this implication. Using a noncopyleft license is weak, and usually an inferior choice, but it's not wrong. In other words, selling exceptions permits some embedding in proprietary software, and the X11 license permits even more embedding. If this doesn't make the X11 license unacceptable, it doesn't make selling exceptions unacceptable\".<ref>Richard Stallman (2010).

So many things to consider and so many interactions to consider. And that GPL incompatibilities are still an issue that actively effects people is something many appear to forget. For instance one would think that the incompatibility of the GPLv2 with the Apache Software License 2.0 should be a thing of the past now that everything upgrades to GPLv3, but it turns out that enough people are either stuck with GPLv2 only or do not agree with the GPLv3 that some Apache Software licensed projects are required to migrate. For instance Twitter's Bootstrap is currently migrating from ASL2.0 to MIT precisely because some people still need GPLv2 compatibility. Among those projects that were affected were Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, the MoinMoin Wiki and others. And even that case shows that people don't care that much about licenses any more as Joomla 3 just bundled bootstrap even though they were not licenses in a compatible way (GPLv2 vs ASL 2.0). The other traditional case of things not being GPL compatible is the OpenSSL project which has a license that does not go well with the GPL. That license is also still incompatible with the GPLv3.

[[Leonard Knight Elmhirst]] was its first Director.\n\n==Overview==\nRabindranath was engaged in his [[Zamindar|zamindari]] work in his family estates at [[Shilaidaha]] and [[Naogaon District#Patisar|Patisar]] during 1890s. In an address to the workers of Sriniketan in 1939, he said, \u201cGradually the sorrow and poverty of the villagers became clear to me, and I began to grow restless to do something about it \u2026.from that time onward I continuously endeavoured to find out how villagers\u2019 mind could be aroused, so that they themselves could accept responsibility for their own lives.\u201c  Tagore wrote, \u201cLife in villages must be made more attractive, work and joy must be combined and an aesthetic sense should be developed.\u201c<ref name=\"rural\">{{cite web | url = http://ijrar.com/upload_issue/ijrar_issue_20542154.pdf | title = Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Model of Rural Reconstruction: A review |first= Dr. Madhumita | last= Chattopadhyay |publisher = IJRAR, October-December 2018|accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe village-oriented activities at Sriniketan were multi-faceted. \u201cIn ''Sikha-Satra'' and ''Sikha-Charcha-Bhavana'', the village boys belonging to all castes received education as well as instruction in music, agriculture, hygiene and sanitation and also in village craft. Experiments were undertaken for varieties of new crops that may be suitable for local conditions in the department of agriculture. Scientific experiments were made in dairy and animal husbandry for improvement of financial conditions of village people. Revival of cottage industries and introduction of new ones was the main motto of the activities in ''Silpa-Bhavana''. Thus, income from agriculture could be supplemented with the help of rural industries. ''Village Welfare Department'' took initiative for public works like road repairing, tank cleaning and maintaining a circulation library. ''Brati Balak'' or boy-scouts organization and ''Maternity and Child Welfare'' section were established in 1940. A number of ''Co-operative Health Societies'' provided medical treatment at a low cost for the villagers\u2026\u201d <ref name=\"rural\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn 1921 Rabindranath bought a large manor house with surrounding lands in [[Surul]], 3&nbsp;km from [[Santiniketan]], from the Sinhas of [[Raipur, Birbhum|Raipur]]. He set up the ''Institute of Rural Reconstruction'' in the manor house, in 1922 with [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst]] as its first Director. [[Rathindranath Tagore]], [[Santosh Chandra Majumdar]], [[Gourgopal Ghosh]], Kalimohan Ghosh and Kim Taro Kasahara joined Elmhirst.<ref name=Basak>Basak, Tapan Kumar, ''Rabindranath-Santiniketan-Sriniketan, An Introduction'', pp. 6&ndash;8, BB Publication</ref>\n\nThe second but contiguous campus of ''Visva Bharati'' was subsequently located around the same place in 1923 and it came to be known as Sriniketan. ''Silpa Bhavana'' at Santiniketan had already started training in handicrafts. Sriniketan took over the work with the objective bringing back life in its completeness to the villages and help people to solve their own problems instead of solution being imposed on them from outside. An emphasis was laid on a scientific study of the village problem before a solution was attempted.<ref name=Basak/> \n\nIn consonance with such ideas about reconstruction of village life a new type of school meant mainly for the children of neighbouring villages, who would eventually bring the offering of their acquired knowledge for the welfare of the village community, was also conceived. ''[[Siksha Satra|Siksha-Satra]]'' was such a school set up at Santiniketan in 1924 but shifted to Sriniketan in 1927. The ''Loka-Siksha Samsad'' an organisation for the propagation of non-formal education amongst those who had no access to usual educational opportunities, was started in 1936. ''Siksha Charcha'' for training village school teachers followed next year. In 1963, an ''agricultural college'' was set up in Sriniketan and in 1977 ''Rural Research Centre'' was set up.<ref name=Basak/>\n\n==The institute==\nJust because Santiniketan is home to such institutions as ''[[Kala Bhavana]]'' and ''[[Sangit Bhavana]]'', it must not be assumed that ''Visva-Bharati'' came to represent only a dreamy aesthetic outlook that ignored the harsh realities of everyday life. Tagore founded an ''Institute of Rural Reconstruction'' in 1922. The place came to be known as Sriniketan (Abode of well-being). He launched a vigorous programme of rural reform that aimed to address the problems that pervaded rural India in the early twentieth century, problems like poverty, disease, ignorance, superstition and caste.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/centenary-of-the-nestii-1502729997.html | title = Centenary of the Nest II |first= Sukalyan| last= Chanda| publisher = The Statesman,  5 February 2019 |accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Institute of Rural Reconstruction'', known (in Bengali) as ''Palli Samgathana Vibhaga'' has four departments: ''Rural Extension Centre'' (Department of Adult, Continuing Education and Extension), ''Palli Charcha Kendra'' (a teaching department founded in 1977), ''Department of Social Work'' (a teaching department founded in 1963 and offers social work degrees at undergraduate, post-graduate and Ph D levels) and ''Silpa Sadan'' (a Centre for Rural Craft, Technology and Design).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/PalliSamgathanaVibhaga.html| title = Palli- Samgathana Vibhaga | publisher = Visva Bharati  |accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref> Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agricultural Science), also located at Sriniketan, is a separate institute that imparts education in agricultural sciences.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/PalliSikshaBhavana.html| title = Palli Siksha Bhavana| publisher =  Visva Bharati |accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Silpa Sadana'' (earlier called ''Silpa Bhavana'') offers 2-year (1 year training + 1 year practice) in leather craft, book binding and handmade packaging, batik work and handmade paper making.

The kind of work that was begun here has since been repeated and elaborated in many programmes of self-help in India. For instance, Sriniketan pioneered the manufacture of hand-crafted leather purses and handbags, a cottage industry which has, since then, taken off elsewhere as well and now exports products to many parts of the world.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url = https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wMmnSxXzXIMC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=santiniketan+leather+goods+Institute+of+Rural+Reconstruction&source=bl&ots=wTPnPQqOAk&sig=ACfU3U08LK4DkqKNsXcBgWFuo_vUEpKy-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiI-5rvuc_kAhWLpo8KHRHtBMM4ChDoATAPegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=santiniketan%20leather%20goods%20Institute%20of%20Rural%20Reconstruction&f=false| title = I Won\u2019t Let You Go: Selected Poems by Rabindranath Tagore |work= Introduction to the First Edition, Page 36| publisher =  Penguin Books India / Google |accessdate =  14 September 2019}}</ref>[[Santiniketan Leather Goods]] have secured [[Geographical indication|GI]] tag.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gitagged.com/gi-tag-products-of-india/ |title = GI Tagged Products of India  | publisher =  GI Tagged |accessdate =  18 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe small scale cottage industry and handicraft items of Sriniketan are identified as special ethnic and traditional products, recognised nationally and even internationally with high esteem.

[[Leonard Knight Elmhirst]] was its first Director.\n\n==Overview==\nRabindranath was engaged in his [[Zamindar|zamindari]] work in his family estates at [[Shilaidaha]] and [[Naogaon District#Patisar|Patisar]] during 1890s. In an address to the workers of Sriniketan in 1939, he said, \u201cGradually the sorrow and poverty of the villagers became clear to me, and I began to grow restless to do something about it \u2026.from that time onward I continuously endeavoured to find out how villagers\u2019 mind could be aroused, so that they themselves could accept responsibility for their own lives.\u201c  Tagore wrote, \u201cLife in villages must be made more attractive, work and joy must be combined and an aesthetic sense should be developed.\u201c<ref name=\"rural\">{{cite web | url = http://ijrar.com/upload_issue/ijrar_issue_20542154.pdf | title = Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s Model of Rural Reconstruction: A review |first= Dr. Madhumita | last= Chattopadhyay |publisher = IJRAR, October-December 2018|accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe village-oriented activities at Sriniketan were multi-faceted. \u201cIn ''Sikha-Satra'' and ''Sikha-Charcha-Bhavana'', the village boys belonging to all castes received education as well as instruction in music, agriculture, hygiene and sanitation and also in village craft. Experiments were undertaken for varieties of new crops that may be suitable for local conditions in the department of agriculture. Scientific experiments were made in dairy and animal husbandry for improvement of financial conditions of village people. Revival of cottage industries and introduction of new ones was the main motto of the activities in ''Silpa-Bhavana''. Thus, income from agriculture could be supplemented with the help of rural industries. ''Village Welfare Department'' took initiative for public works like road repairing, tank cleaning and maintaining a circulation library. ''Brati Balak'' or boy-scouts organization and ''Maternity and Child Welfare'' section were established in 1940. A number of ''Co-operative Health Societies'' provided medical treatment at a low cost for the villagers\u2026\u201d <ref name=\"rural\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn 1921 Rabindranath bought a large manor house with surrounding lands in [[Surul]], 3&nbsp;km from [[Santiniketan]], from the Sinhas of [[Raipur, Birbhum|Raipur]]. He set up the ''Institute of Rural Reconstruction'' in the manor house, in 1922 with [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst]] as its first Director. [[Rathindranath Tagore]], [[Santosh Chandra Majumdar]], [[Gourgopal Ghosh]], Kalimohan Ghosh and Kim Taro Kasahara joined Elmhirst.<ref name=Basak>Basak, Tapan Kumar, ''Rabindranath-Santiniketan-Sriniketan, An Introduction'', pp. 6&ndash;8, BB Publication</ref>\n\nThe second but contiguous campus of ''Visva Bharati'' was subsequently located around the same place in 1923 and it came to be known as Sriniketan. ''Silpa Bhavana'' at Santiniketan had already started training in handicrafts. Sriniketan took over the work with the objective bringing back life in its completeness to the villages and help people to solve their own problems instead of solution being imposed on them from outside. An emphasis was laid on a scientific study of the village problem before a solution was attempted.<ref name=Basak/> \n\nIn consonance with such ideas about reconstruction of village life a new type of school meant mainly for the children of neighbouring villages, who would eventually bring the offering of their acquired knowledge for the welfare of the village community, was also conceived. ''[[Siksha Satra|Siksha-Satra]]'' was such a school set up at Santiniketan in 1924 but shifted to Sriniketan in 1927. The ''Loka-Siksha Samsad'' an organisation for the propagation of non-formal education amongst those who had no access to usual educational opportunities, was started in 1936. ''Siksha Charcha'' for training village school teachers followed next year. In 1963, an ''agricultural college'' was set up in Sriniketan and in 1977 ''Rural Research Centre'' was set up.<ref name=Basak/>\n\n==The institute==\nJust because Santiniketan is home to such institutions as ''[[Kala Bhavana]]'' and ''[[Sangit Bhavana]]'', it must not be assumed that ''Visva-Bharati'' came to represent only a dreamy aesthetic outlook that ignored the harsh realities of everyday life. Tagore founded an ''Institute of Rural Reconstruction'' in 1922. The place came to be known as Sriniketan (Abode of well-being). He launched a vigorous programme of rural reform that aimed to address the problems that pervaded rural India in the early twentieth century, problems like poverty, disease, ignorance, superstition and caste.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/centenary-of-the-nestii-1502729997.html | title = Centenary of the Nest II |first= Sukalyan| last= Chanda| publisher = The Statesman,  5 February 2019 |accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Institute of Rural Reconstruction'', known (in Bengali) as ''Palli Samgathana Vibhaga'' has four departments: ''Rural Extension Centre'' (Department of Adult, Continuing Education and Extension), ''Palli Charcha Kendra'' (a teaching department founded in 1977), ''Department of Social Work'' (a teaching department founded in 1963 and offers social work degrees at undergraduate, post-graduate and Ph D levels) and ''Silpa Sadan'' (a Centre for Rural Craft, Technology and Design).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/PalliSamgathanaVibhaga.html| title = Palli- Samgathana Vibhaga | publisher = Visva Bharati  |accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref> Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agricultural Science), also located at Sriniketan, is a separate institute that imparts education in agricultural sciences.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/PalliSikshaBhavana.html| title = Palli Siksha Bhavana| publisher =  Visva Bharati |accessdate =  12 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Silpa Sadana'' (earlier called ''Silpa Bhavana'') offers 2-year (1 year training + 1 year practice) in leather craft, book binding and handmade packaging, batik work and handmade paper making.

The idea is to encourage the villagers to become self-reliant through formation of village development societies, self-help groups, Brati organisations, mohila samities and the like. The area of operation of the unit spread over 43 villages under 8 [[Gram Panchayat]]s in 2 [[Community development block in India|blocks]] of [[Bolpur Sriniketan]] and [[Ilambazar (community development block)|Illambazar]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/RuralExtensionCentre.html| title = Rural Extension Centre | publisher = Visva Bharati  |accessdate =  16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] established the ''Krishi Vigyan Kendra'' mandated for the district of Birbhum, West Bengal in 1994 under the administrative control of Palli Siksha Bhavana.

The kind of work that was begun here has since been repeated and elaborated in many programmes of self-help in India. For instance, Sriniketan pioneered the manufacture of hand-crafted leather purses and handbags, a cottage industry which has, since then, taken off elsewhere as well and now exports products to many parts of the world.\u201d<ref>{{cite web | url = https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wMmnSxXzXIMC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=santiniketan+leather+goods+Institute+of+Rural+Reconstruction&source=bl&ots=wTPnPQqOAk&sig=ACfU3U08LK4DkqKNsXcBgWFuo_vUEpKy-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiI-5rvuc_kAhWLpo8KHRHtBMM4ChDoATAPegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=santiniketan%20leather%20goods%20Institute%20of%20Rural%20Reconstruction&f=false| title = I Won\u2019t Let You Go: Selected Poems by Rabindranath Tagore |work= Introduction to the First Edition, Page 36| publisher =  Penguin Books India / Google |accessdate =  14 September 2019}}</ref>[[Santiniketan Leather Goods]] have secured [[Geographical indication|GI]] tag.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gitagged.com/gi-tag-products-of-india/ |title = GI Tagged Products of India  | publisher =  GI Tagged |accessdate =  18 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe small scale cottage industry and handicraft items of Sriniketan are identified as special ethnic and traditional products, recognised nationally and even internationally with high esteem. Students of Tagore\u2019s art and craft centre at Sriniketan and the artists of Kala Bhavana are known for their extra-ordinary skill and craftsmanship.

These items involve most of the women of the villages from mainly minority and backward classes who have developed unique skills through repetitive and voluminous productivity. The men of these families search for market outlets and help these products fetching a fair price. It is very interesting to note that now-a-days this particular occupation has taken a systematic mass engagement pattern where a number of self-help groups with cluster of at least 9 to 11 or more women together, earning their daily wages and even forming a co-operative for financial support through micro-finance.<ref name=\"smallscale\"/> \n[[File:Saturday Haat - Sonajhuri - Birbhum 2014-06-28 5310.JPG|thumb|400px|right|Local village handicrafts at the Saturday Haat at Sonajhuri]]\n\"NIFT, the nation-level textile organisation has been working on this model and a good number of NGOs are also coming forward for utilising these rich resource of skilled artisans.

Points of interest in this section include Biggin Wood (one of the few remnants of the [[Great North Wood]]), [[Streatham Common]], [[Tooting Bec Lido]] and [[Wandsworth Common]].\n\n===South-west London===\nHere the Capital Ring comprises two walks, walk 6 and 7. Walk 6 consists of a brief walk through suburban [[Wimbledon Park]], then crosses [[Wimbledon Common]] and then [[Richmond Park]].  While the route passes within about 100 metres of [[King Henry VIII's Mound]], with its [[protected view]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], this is not indicated on the signposts for the route. Walk 7 continues from Richmond along the Thames, before deviating through old [[Isleworth]], then through the grounds of [[Syon Park]].  It then continues along the [[Grand Union Canal]] to Osterley Lock.\n\n===West and north-west London===\nHere the Capital Ring comprises two walks, walk 8 and 9.  Points of interest in this section include the [[River Brent]], the [[Wharncliffe Viaduct]], [[Horsenden Hill]] (with panoramic views) and [[Harrow School]].\n\n===North London===\nThe Capital Ring comprises two walks, walk 10 and 11, in North London.\n\nWalk 10 starts from [[South Kenton railway station]], crosses [[Preston Park (Brent)|Preston Park]] and passes [[Preston Road tube station|Preston Road underground station]], before reaching [[Fryent Country Park]]. It then heads south and east to [[Brent Reservoir]] and [[West Hendon]] where it crosses the [[Edgware Road]], [[M1 motorway]] and [[A41 road|A41]] to reach [[Hendon Park]], near [[Hendon Central tube station|Hendon Central Underground station]].\n\nWalk 11 starts at Hendon Park, again following the [[River Brent]] and [[Mutton Brook]] through [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. It passes [[East Finchley tube station|East Finchley Underground station]], [[Cherry Tree Wood]] and [[Highgate Wood]] (complete with a tea shop, interpretive display, and green grassy picnic area). From here it passes through [[Queen's Wood]] to the Northern Line's [[Highgate tube station|Highgate Underground station]].\n\n===North-east London===\nThe Capital Ring is made up of two walks, walk 12 and 13. Walk 12 covers [[Highgate]] to [[Stoke Newington]], and walk 13 Stoke Newington to [[Hackney Wick]].\n\nWalk 12 starts at the Priory Gardens entrance to Highgate Underground station and follows the [[Parkland Walk]] past [[Crouch End]] to [[Finsbury Park]]. After crossing the park it follows the [[New River (England)|New River]] past the Stoke Newington reservoirs. It then crosses [[Clissold Park]] and [[Abney Park Cemetery]] before reaching [[Stoke Newington railway station]]; Stoke Newington is also served by the [[London Buses route 73|73 bus]]. Walk 13 heads east though the streets of [[Lower Clapton]] to [[Springfield Park (London)|Springfield Park]] before following the [[River Lee Navigation]] south through [[Lea Bridge]] to White Post Lane, near [[Hackney Wick railway station]].\n\n===East London===\nIn this area, the Capital Ring comprises two walks, walk 14 and 15, which pass through the area used for the London [[2012 Summer Olympics]], including [[Pudding Mill Lane DLR station]]. Walk 14 follows [[Greenway, London|The Greenway]] for most of its distance.\n\n==Length==\nAuthorities do not agree on the length of the route. [[Walk London]] give the length as {{convert|125|km|mi|abbr=on}}, though the distances they give for the 15 sections sum to {{convert|133|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and they quote an average length of the 15 sections of {{convert|7.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which produces a total of {{convert|117|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walklondon.org.uk/route.asp?route%3D1 |title=Route overview: Capital Ring |publisher=Walk London |accessdate=25 July 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231080304/http://www.walklondon.org.uk/route.asp?route=1 |archivedate=31 December 2007 }}</ref> The total is only {{convert|115|km|mi|abbr=on}} according to the [[The Ramblers|Ramblers]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/info/paths/capitalring.html |title=Capital Ring |publisher=Ramblers |accessdate=25 July 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030151411/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/INFO/paths/capitalring.html |archivedate=30 October 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the [[Transport for London]] website gives it as {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/capital-ring|title=Capital Ring Walk|date=|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref> Plotting the official route on digital 1:25,000 mapping gives a length of about {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luphen.org.uk/walks/capital_ring/capital_ring.htm |title=Capital Ring \u2013 a walk around inner London |publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n | first = Colin\n | last = Saunders\n | date=2006\n | title = The Capital Ring\n | publisher = Aurum Press\n | isbn = 1-84513-075-8\n }}\n\n==See also==\n*[[London Outer Orbital Path]] \u2013 a longer walking route around outer London.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML|display=title,inline}}\n*[https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/capital-ring Official Transport for London site with maps of each walk]\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jan/27/walkingholidays.london Observer Feature by Stephen Emms on Capital Ring]\n*[http://www.londoncapitalring.blogspot.com London Capital Ring Blog]\n*[http://www.bertuchi.co.uk/crindex.php Photos and description of a walk taken around the Capital Ring during 2006]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000925194427/http://www.greenchain.com/ Greenchain.com \u2013 official site of the southeast section of the Capital Ring]\n*[http://www.openstreetmap.org/?relation=10952 Full route on OpenStreetMap]\n\n{{Long-distance footpaths in London}}\n\n[[Category:Walking in London]]\n[[Category:Transport in the London Borough of Croydon]]\n[[Category:Long-distance footpaths in England]]\n[[Category:Footpaths in London]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Ring"}

Periodization in the context of fitness or strength training programs means scheduling for adequate recovery time between training sessions, and for variety over the course of a long-term program.

In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|\"baby boomer\"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.<ref name=\"census.gov\">{{cite web |author=Carrie A.

In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).<ref name=\"census.gov\"/>\n\n=== Geographic distribution of older adults in the United States ===\nThe number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.<ref name=\"census.gov\"/>\n\n== Biogerontology ==\n[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]\n{{Main|Theories of aging}}\nBiogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process.

Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try.

Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.<ref name=\"Taylor\" />\n\n==== Accumulation ====\nAccumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.<ref name= Taylor /> An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.\n\n==== Free radical theory ====\n[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage.

These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.\n\n==== DNA damage theory ====\n\nDNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958<ref>{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124\u20131140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}</ref> is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.|date=January 1959|volume=45|issue=1|pages=30\u201345|pmid=16590351|pmc=222509|doi=10.1073/pnas.45.1.30|bibcode=1959PNAS...45...30S}}</ref> This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freitas|first=AA|author2=de Magalhaes, JP|title=A review and appraisal of the DNA damage theory of ageing|journal=Mutat Res|date=Jul\u2013Oct 2011|volume=728|issue=1\u20132|pages=12\u201322|pmid=21600302|doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2011.05.001}}</ref>\n\n====Cross-linking theory====\n\nThe cross-linking theory proposes that [[advanced glycation end-product]]s (stable bonds formed by the binding of glucose to proteins) and other aberrant [[cross-links]] accumulating in aging tissues is the cause of aging. The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Genetic ===\nGenetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a \"biological clock\" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types|journal=Genome Biology |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages= R115|year=2013 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115|pmid=24138928 |pmc=4015143}}</ref>\n\n=== General imbalance ===\nGeneral imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.<ref name= Taylor />\n\n====Immunological theory====\n\nThe immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Social gerontology ==\nSocial gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.\n\nBecause issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.\n\n=== Social theories of aging ===\nSeveral theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.<ref name=Phillipson>{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S.

According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\nActivity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.<ref name=\"allnurses-breakroom.com\">VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760</ref>\n\n==== Disengagement theory ====\n[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose \"ego-energy\" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\nGradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.\n\n==== Continuity theory ====\n[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,\nto exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to\nbe uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.\nThis static view of continuity is not very applicable\nto human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic\nview of continuity starts with the idea of a basic\nstructure which persists over time, but it allows for a\nvariety of changes to occur within the context provided\nby the basic structure. The basic structure is\ncoherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts\nthat is recognizably unique and that allows us to\ndifferentiate that structure from others. With the\nintroduction of the concept of time, ideas such as\ndirection, sequence, character development, and\nstory line enter into the concept of continuity as it is\napplied to the evolution of a human being. In this\ntheory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed\nand applied to the issue of adaptation to normal\naging.<ref>{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}</ref>\n\nA central premise of continuity theory is that, in\nmaking adaptive choices, middle-aged and older\nadults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal\nand external structures and that they prefer to\naccomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,\napplying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).\nIn middle and later life, adults are drawn by the\nweight of past experience to use continuity as a\nprimary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes\nassociated with normal aging. To the extent that\nchange builds upon, and has links to, the person's\npast, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both\ntheir own perceptions and pressures from the social\nenvironment, individuals who are adapting to normal\naging are both predisposed and motivated\ntoward inner psychological continuity as well as outward\ncontinuity of social behavior and circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/techniquesproble0000hage }}</ref>\n\nContinuity theory views both internal and\nexternal continuity as robust adaptive strategies that\nare supported by both individual preference and\nsocial sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general\nadaptive principles that people who are normally \naging could be expected to follow, explanations of\nhow these principles work, and a specification of\ngeneral areas of life in which these principles could\nbe expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory\nhas enormous potential as a general theory of\nadaptation to individual aging.<ref>{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}</ref>\n\n==== Age stratification theory ====\nAccording to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define \"age strata\". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\n==== Life course theory ====\nAccording to this theory, which stems from the [[life course approach|life course perspective]] (Bengston and Allen, 1993),<ref name=life>Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html</ref> aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\nAlso reflecting the life course focus,\nconsider the implications for how societies might function when age-based\nnorms vanish\u2014a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course\u2014\nand suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging\nand the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,\nmorbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the\norganization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and\nleisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new\nways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as\nwell, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need\nto be reconceptualized.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/successfulaging00rowe }}<br>Webster, N. (2003). Webster's new American dictionary.

A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage \"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\". Advantages and disadvantages in early life stages have a profound effect throughout the life span. However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\n== Environmental gerontology ==\nEnvironmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America.

The field started from legal scholars in the field of [[elder law]], which found that looking into legal issues of older persons without a broader inter-disciplinary perspective does not provide the ideal legal outcome. Using theories such as [[therapeutic jurisprudence]], jurisprudential scholars critically examined existing legal institutions (e.g. adult guardianship, [[End-of-life care|end of life]] care, or [[Nursing home residents' rights|nursing homes]] regulations) and showed how law should look more closely to the social and psychological aspects of its real-life operation.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mlv15&div=27&id=&page=|title=Therapeutic Jurisprudence and End-of-Life Medical Care: Physician Perceptions of a Statute's Impact Medical Law 15 Medicine and Law 1996|pages=201\u201317|journal=Medicine and Law|volume=15|issue=2|access-date=2018-03-20|year=1996|last1=Kapp|first1=Marshall B.|pmid=8908972}}</ref> Other streams within jurisprudential gerontology also encouraged physicians and lawyers to try to improve their cooperation and better understand how laws and regulatory institutions affect health and well being of older persons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doron|first=Israel|last2=Meenan|first2=Helen|date=2012|title=Time for Geriatric Jurisprudence|journal=Gerontology|language=english|volume=58|issue=3|pages=193\u20136|doi=10.1159/000335324|pmid=22538767|issn=0304-324X}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[:Category:Gerontology journals|Academic journals on gerontology]]\n* [[Aging and memory]]\n* [[Aging Portfolio]]\n* [[Biological clock (aging)|Biological clock]]\n* [[Bionics]] \n* [[Clinical geropsychology]]\n* [[Elderly care]]\n* [[Financial Gerontology]]\n* [[Life extension]]\n* [[List of life extension topics]]\n* [[Old age]]\n* [[Oldest people]]\n* [[Silver Alert]]\n* [[Timeline of senescence research]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline}}\n\n{{Longevity}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ageing]]\n[[Category:Life extension]]\n[[Category:Branches of biology]]\n[[Category:Interdisciplinary subfields of sociology]]\n[[Category:Gerontology|*]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 1900s]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Study of the social, psychological and biological aspects of aging}}\n{{For|the journal|Gerontology (journal)}}\n{{essay-like|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Opdracht HP UVV-bejaardensocieteit in gebouw Reigersburg Amsterdam-Oost bejaar, Bestanddeelnr 923-7802.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Elders playing cards in Amsterdam.]]\n'''Gerontology'''  is the study of the [[social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Psychology|psychological]], [[cognitive]], and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[ageing]].

There are policy issues, for example, involved in government planning and the operation of nursing homes, investigating the effects of an [[Population ageing|ageing population]] on society, and the design of residential spaces for older people that facilitate the development of a sense of place or home. Dr. Lawton, a behavioral psychologist at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, was among the first to recognize the need for living spaces designed to accommodate the elderly, especially those with Alzheimer's disease.

In 1900, there were 3.1 million people aged 65 years and older living in the [[United States]].  However, this population continued to grow throughout the 20th century and reached 31.2, 35, and 40.3 million people in 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively.  Notably, in the United States and across the world, the [[Baby boomers|\"baby boomer\"]] generation began to turn 65 in 2011.  Recently, the population aged 65 years and older has grown at a faster rate than the total population in the United States.  The total population increased by 9.7%, from 281.4 million to 308.7 million, between 2000 and 2010.  However, the population aged 65 years and older increased by 15.1% during the same period.<ref name=\"census.gov\">{{cite web |author=Carrie A.

In both 2000 and 2010, women outnumbered men in the older population at every single year of age (e.g., 65 to 100 years and over).  The [[sex ratio]], which is a measure used to indicate the balance of males to females in a population, is calculated by taking the number of males divided by the number of females, and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the sex ratio is the number of males per 100 females.  In 2010, there were 90.5 males per 100 females in the 65-year-old population.  However, this represented an increase from 1990 when there were 82.7 males per 100 females, and from 2000 when the sex ratio was 88.1. Although the gender gap between men and women has narrowed, women continue to have a greater life expectancy and lower mortality rates at older ages relative to men. For example, the [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]] reported that there were approximately twice as many women as men living in the United States at 89 years of age (361,309 versus 176,689, respectively).<ref name=\"census.gov\"/>\n\n=== Geographic distribution of older adults in the United States ===\nThe number and percentage of older adults living in the United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census.  In 2010, the South contained the greatest number of people aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.  However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest percentage of adults aged 65 years and older (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the [[Census 2000]], all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older. The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.  Likewise, in the population aged 85 years and older, the West (42.8%) also showed the fastest growth and increased from 806,000 in 2000 to 1.2 million in 2010. It is worth highlighting that [[Rhode Island]] was the only state that experienced a reduction in the number of people aged 65 years and older, and declined from 152,402 in 2000 to 151,881 in 2010.  Conversely, all states exhibited an increase in the population of adults aged 85 years and older from 2000 to 2010.<ref name=\"census.gov\"/>\n\n== Biogerontology ==\n[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|The hand of an older adult]]\n{{Main|Theories of aging}}\nBiogerontology is the sub-field of gerontology concerned with the [[Senescence|biological aging process]], its evolutionary origins, and potential means to intervene in the process.

Biogerontologists vary in the degree to which they focus on the study of the aging process as a means of mitigating the [[age-related disease|diseases of aging]] or extending lifespan, although most agree that extension of lifespan will necessarily flow from reductions in age-related disease and frailty, although some argue that [[maximum life span]] cannot be altered or that it is undesirable to try.

The cells and tissues are eventually injured due to the damage gathered over time. This causes the diminishes in an organ's function related to age. The notion of accumulated damage was first introduced by Weisman as the \"wear and tear\" theory.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1=Lipsky|first1=Martin S.|last2=King|first2=Mitch|title=Biological theories of aging|journal=Disease-a-Month|date=2015|volume=61|issue=11|pages=460\u2013466|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2015.09.005|pmid=26490576}}</ref>\n\n====Wear and tear theory====\n\nWear and tear theories of aging suggest that as an individual ages, body parts such as cells and organs wear out from continued use. Wearing of the body can be attributable to internal or external causes that eventually lead to an accumulation of [[Insult (medical)|insults]] which surpasses the capacity for repair. Due to these internal and external insults, cells lose their ability to regenerate, which ultimately leads to mechanical and chemical exhaustion. Some insults include chemicals in the air, food, or smoke. Other insults may be things such as viruses, trauma, free radicals, cross-linking, and high body temperature.<ref name=\"Taylor\" />\n\n==== Accumulation ====\nAccumulation theories of aging suggest that aging is bodily decline that results from an accumulation of elements, whether introduced to the body from the environment or resulting from cell metabolism.<ref name= Taylor /> An example of an accumulation theory is the Free Radical Theory of Aging.\n\n==== Free radical theory ====\n[[Free radicals]] are reactive molecules produced by cellular and environmental processes, and can damage the elements of the cell such as the [[cell membrane]] and [[DNA]] and cause irreversible damage.

These conditions become more common as humans grow older and include diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.\n\n==== DNA damage theory ====\n\nDNA damage has been one of the many causes in diseases related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by [[Gioacchino Failla]] in 1958<ref>{{cite journal|last=Failla|first=G|title=The aging process and cancerogenesis|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 September 1958|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1124\u20131140|pmid=13583876|bibcode=1958NYASA..71.1124F|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1958.tb46828.x}}</ref> is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Szilard|first=Leo|title=On the nature of the aging process|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The crosslinking of proteins disables their biological functions. The hardening of the connective tissue, kidney diseases, and enlargement of the heart are connected to the cross-linking of proteins. [[Crosslinking of DNA]] can induce replication errors, and this leads to deformed cells and increases the risk of [[cancer]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Genetic ===\nGenetic theories of aging propose that aging is programmed within each individual's genes. According to this theory, genes dictate cellular longevity. Programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]], is determined by a \"biological clock\" via genetic information in the nucleus of the cell. Genes responsible for apoptosis provide an explanation for cell death, but are less applicable to death of an entire organism. An increase in cellular apoptosis may correlate to aging, but is not a 'cause of death'. Environmental factors and genetic mutations can influence gene expression and accelerate aging. More recently epigenetics have been explored as a contributing factor. The [[epigenetic clock]], which objectively measures the biological age of cells and tissues, may become useful for testing different biological aging theories.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Horvath S |title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types|journal=Genome Biology |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages= R115|year=2013 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115|pmid=24138928 |pmc=4015143}}</ref>\n\n=== General imbalance ===\nGeneral imbalance theories of aging suggest that body systems, such as the [[Endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], and immune systems, gradually decline and ultimately fail to function. The rate of failure varies system by system.<ref name= Taylor />\n\n====Immunological theory====\n\nThe immunological theory of aging suggests that the immune system weakens as an organism ages. This makes the organism unable to fight infections and less able to destroy old and [[Neoplasm|neoplastic cells]]. This leads to aging and will eventually lead to death. This theory of aging was developed by Ray Walford, an American gerontologist. According to Walford, incorrect immunological procedures are the cause of the process of aging.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Social gerontology ==\nSocial gerontology is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in [[social work]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[demography]], [[public health]], or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for educating, researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people.\n\nBecause issues of life span and life extension need numbers to quantify them, there is an overlap with [[demography]]. Those who study the demography of the human life span differ from those who study the social demographics of aging.\n\n=== Social theories of aging ===\nSeveral theories of aging are developed to observe the aging process of older adults in society as well as how these processes are interpreted by men and women as they age.<ref name=Phillipson>{{cite book |first1=C. |last1=Phillipson |first2=J. |last2=Baars |chapter=Ch. 4: Social theory and social ageing |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtYhf5fdTl4C&pg=PA68 |editor1-last=Bond |editor1-first=J. |editor2-last=Peace |editor2-first=S.

According to this theory, older adults' self-concept depends on social interactions. In order for older adults to maintain morale in old age, substitutions must be made for lost roles. Examples of lost roles include retirement from a job or loss of a spouse.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\nActivity is preferable to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, [[post-industrial society]], which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a desire to do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.<ref name=\"allnurses-breakroom.com\">VickyRN. (August 2, '09). Theories of Aging (Part 3) - Sociological Theories. Retrieved Friday, April 20, 2012, from http://allnurses-breakroom.com/showthread.php?t=412760</ref>\n\n==== Disengagement theory ====\n[[Disengagement theory]] was developed by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose \"ego-energy\" and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\nGradual withdrawal from society and relationships preserves social equilibrium and promotes self-reflection for elders who are freed from societal roles. It furnishes an orderly means for the transfer of knowledge, capital, and power from the older generation to the young. It makes it possible for society to continue functioning after valuable older members die.\n\n==== Continuity theory ====\n[[Continuity theory]] is an elusive concept. On one hand,\nto exhibit continuity can mean to remain the same, to\nbe uniform, homogeneous, unchanging, even humdrum.\nThis static view of continuity is not very applicable\nto human aging. On the other hand, a dynamic\nview of continuity starts with the idea of a basic\nstructure which persists over time, but it allows for a\nvariety of changes to occur within the context provided\nby the basic structure. The basic structure is\ncoherent: It has an orderly or logical relation of parts\nthat is recognizably unique and that allows us to\ndifferentiate that structure from others. With the\nintroduction of the concept of time, ideas such as\ndirection, sequence, character development, and\nstory line enter into the concept of continuity as it is\napplied to the evolution of a human being. In this\ntheory, a dynamic concept of continuity is developed\nand applied to the issue of adaptation to normal\naging.<ref>{{cite book |author=Blalock, H.M. |title=Conceptualization and measurement in the social sciences |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills |year=1982 |isbn=978-0803918047 }}</ref>\n\nA central premise of continuity theory is that, in\nmaking adaptive choices, middle-aged and older\nadults attempt to preserve and maintain existing internal\nand external structures and that they prefer to\naccomplish this objective by using continuity (i.e.,\napplying familiar strategies in familiar arenas of life).\nIn middle and later life, adults are drawn by the\nweight of past experience to use continuity as a\nprimary adaptive strategy for dealing with changes\nassociated with normal aging. To the extent that\nchange builds upon, and has links to, the person's\npast, change is a part of continuity. As a result of both\ntheir own perceptions and pressures from the social\nenvironment, individuals who are adapting to normal\naging are both predisposed and motivated\ntoward inner psychological continuity as well as outward\ncontinuity of social behavior and circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hage, J. |title=Techniques and problems of theory construction in sociology |publisher=Wiley Interscience |location=New York |year=1972 |isbn=978-0471338604 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/techniquesproble0000hage }}</ref>\n\nContinuity theory views both internal and\nexternal continuity as robust adaptive strategies that\nare supported by both individual preference and\nsocial sanctions. Continuity theory consists of general\nadaptive principles that people who are normally \naging could be expected to follow, explanations of\nhow these principles work, and a specification of\ngeneral areas of life in which these principles could\nbe expected to apply. Accordingly, continuity theory\nhas enormous potential as a general theory of\nadaptation to individual aging.<ref>{{cite book |first=Abraham |last=Kaplan |title=The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ks8wuZHSKs8C |year=1964 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0448-8}}</ref>\n\n==== Age stratification theory ====\nAccording to this theory, older adults born during different time periods form [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s that define \"age strata\". There are two differences among strata: chronological age and historical experience. This theory makes two arguments. 1. Age is a mechanism for regulating behavior and as a result determines access to positions of power. 2. Birth cohorts play an influential role in the process of social change.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\n==== Life course theory ====\nAccording to this theory, which stems from the Life Course Perspective (Bengston and Allen, 1993),<ref name=life>Life Course Theory-Historical Development, Key Principles and Concepts, Selected Research Applications:http://family.jrank.org/pages/1074/Life-Course-Theory.html</ref> aging occurs from birth to death. Aging involves social, psychological, and biological processes. Additionally, aging experiences are shaped by cohort and period effects.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\nAlso reflecting the life course focus,\nconsider the implications for how societies might function when age-based\nnorms vanish\u2014a consequence of the deinstitutionalization of the life course\u2014\nand suggest that these implications pose new challenges for theorizing aging\nand the life course in postindustrial societies. Dramatic reductions in mortality,\nmorbidity, and fertility over the past several decades have so shaken up the\norganization of the life course and the nature of educational, work, family, and\nleisure experiences that it is now possible for individuals to become old in new\nways. The configurations and content of other life stages are being altered as\nwell, especially for women. In consequence, theories of age and aging will need\nto be reconceptualized.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Rowe, J.W. |author2=Kahn, R.L. |title=Successful aging |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0375400452 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/successfulaging00rowe }}<br>Webster, N.

A paradigm of this theory can be expressed in the adage \"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\".

However, advantages and disadvantages in middle adulthood have a direct influence on economic and health status in later life.<ref name=Phillipson/>\n\n== Environmental gerontology ==\nEnvironmental gerontology is a specialization within gerontology that seeks an understanding and interventions to optimize the relationship between aging persons and their physical and social environments.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. |author2=Rodriguez-Rodriguez, V. |title=Environmental Gerontology in Europe and Latin America.

Gansworth himself sees the two themes most important to his work as being \"the ways history informs the present\" and also a strong interest in entertainment culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nativelit.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/qa-with-eric-gansworth/ |title=Q&A with Eric Gansworth |work=[[Native American Literature Symposium]] Blog |publisher=NALS |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407014639/https://nativelit.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/qa-with-eric-gansworth/ |archive-date=April 7, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCritic Susan Bernardin has analyzed Gansworth's writing via [[Gerald Vizenor]]'s concept of [[survivance]], suggesting that his novel ''Mending Skins'' \"suggests how Native peoples reimagine patterns of loss into new stories, especially through humored stories of survivance.\"<ref>Susan Bernardin, \"As Long as the Hair Shall Grow:Survivance in Eric Gansworth's Reservation Fictions,\" in ''Survivance'', ed.
