[[Takuya Kimura]] and [[Tomoko Yamaguchi]] played the lead characters. The series enjoyed high ratings and was the earliest of a series of hit productions starring Kimura. It features music by [[Cagnet (band)|Cagnet]]. The theme song was ''[[La La La Love Song]]'' by [[Toshinobu Kubota]] with [[Naomi Campbell]].\n\n==Summary==\n\nMinami and Sena meet when Sena's apartment-mate, Asakura, jilts Minami on their wedding day.  Minami learns from Sena that Asakura has left, whereabouts unknown.  Sena allows Minami to move into the apartment, since she is penniless, having given all her money to Asakura, and cannot pay the rent on her apartment.\n\nThis is the beginning of a romance between Sena and Minami. Minami and Sena confide in and console each other about their relationship problems and their lack of success in life.\n\nMinami meets a professional photographer, Sugisaki, who proposes marriage. Finally Sena has a chance of winning a piano competition and going to Boston, joining the symphony orchestra.\n\nThe characters in the series have something in common\u2014if not jobless, they can do no better than secure a temporary job. This is a portrayal of a time when Japan was plagued by deep recession, when its people suffered profound depression from constant failure to earn a stable income. The series also portrays how relationships are made and broken, and explores how people come to depend on each other for solace.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Takuya Kimura]] as {{nihongo|Sena Hidetoshi|\u702c\u540d\u79c0\u4fca}}\n*[[Tomoko Yamaguchi]] as {{nihongo|Hayama Minami|\u8449\u5c71\u5357}}\n*[[Yutaka Takenouchi]] as {{nihongo|Hayama Shinji|\u8449\u5c71\u771f\u4e8c}}\n*[[Takako Matsu]] as {{nihongo|Okusawa Ryoko|\u5965\u6ca2\u6dbc\u5b50}}\n*[[Izumi Inamori]] as {{nihongo|Koishikawa Momoko|\u5c0f\u77f3\u5ddd\u6843\u5b50}}\n*[[Ry\u014d (actress)|Ry\u014d]] as {{nihongo|Himuro Rumiko|\u6c37\u5ba4\u30eb\u30df\u5b50}}\n*[[Leo Morimoto]] as {{nihongo|Professor Sasaki|\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u6559\u6388}}\n*[[Ry\u014dko Hirosue]] as {{nihongo|Saito Takako|\u6589\u85e4\u8cb4\u5b50}}\n*[[Kosuke Toyohara]] as {{nihongo|Sugisaki Tetsuya|\u6749\u5d0e\u54f2\u4e5f}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n*Hidetoshi Sena (24) \u2013 An ambitious pianist with dreams of the big time. After graduating from music school, he teaches at a children's piano school for a small income. He lives in an apartment with a baby grand piano in the living room. Sena practises for piano competitions throughout the series. Despite his seemingly very adept technical ability and Sasaki's high opinion of Sena's playing, Sena constantly meets with failure. The reason for this becomes clearer as the story unfolds. Momoko calls him \"Ayrton\" because his surname resembles that of former motor-racing world champion [[Ayrton Senna]]. He suffers many harsh remarks from arrogant student Takako, but still helps her in her struggle with life.\n*Minami Hayama (31) \u2013 An independent and uninhibited 30-year-old woman. Once in demand as a fashion model, she now works as a small-time model on increasingly infrequent jobs. She is unlucky in love: Her fianc\u00e9 elopes with a younger woman on their wedding day. Through a series of circumstances, Minami comes to stay in Sena's house. Their deepening relationship is a main thread of the drama.\n*Shinji Hayama \u2013 Minami's younger brother. A loafer and notorious womanizer, he is also a talented pianist who is later revealed to have had a promising piano career. He comes to Tokyo with his girlfriend Rumiko, relying on [[pachinko]] winnings to foot the bill. He later buys a bar and runs it with her.\n*Ryoko Okusawa \u2013 A very talented pianist but shy with a sheltered upbringing. She is a student in the same music school that Sena graduated from and considered a future star. Sena develops a crush on her but she seems indifferent toward him. Shinji briefly seduces her but later leaves her.\n*Momoko Koishikawa \u2013 Minami's junior in the modelling company and a close friend of Minami.

[[Takuya Kimura]] and [[Tomoko Yamaguchi]] played the lead characters. The series enjoyed high ratings and was the earliest of a series of hit productions starring Kimura. It features music by [[Cagnet (band)|Cagnet]]. The theme song was ''[[La La La Love Song]]'' by [[Toshinobu Kubota]] with [[Naomi Campbell]].\n\n==Summary==\n\nMinami and Sena meet when Sena's apartment-mate, Asakura, jilts Minami on their wedding day.  Minami learns from Sena that Asakura has left, whereabouts unknown.  Sena allows Minami to move into the apartment, since she is penniless, having given all her money to Asakura, and cannot pay the rent on her apartment.\n\nThis is the beginning of a romance between Sena and Minami. Minami and Sena confide in and console each other about their relationship problems and their lack of success in life.\n\nMinami meets a professional photographer, Sugisaki, who proposes marriage. Finally Sena has a chance of winning a piano competition and going to Boston, joining the symphony orchestra.\n\nThe characters in the series have something in common\u2014if not jobless, they can do no better than secure a temporary job. This is a portrayal of a time when Japan was plagued by deep recession, when its people suffered profound depression from constant failure to earn a stable income. The series portrays how relationships are made and broken, and explores how people come to depend on each other for solace.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Takuya Kimura]] as {{nihongo|Sena Hidetoshi|\u702c\u540d\u79c0\u4fca}}\n*[[Tomoko Yamaguchi]] as {{nihongo|Hayama Minami|\u8449\u5c71\u5357}}\n*[[Yutaka Takenouchi]] as {{nihongo|Hayama Shinji|\u8449\u5c71\u771f\u4e8c}}\n*[[Takako Matsu]] as {{nihongo|Okusawa Ryoko|\u5965\u6ca2\u6dbc\u5b50}}\n*[[Izumi Inamori]] as {{nihongo|Koishikawa Momoko|\u5c0f\u77f3\u5ddd\u6843\u5b50}}\n*[[Ry\u014d (actress)|Ry\u014d]] as {{nihongo|Himuro Rumiko|\u6c37\u5ba4\u30eb\u30df\u5b50}}\n*[[Leo Morimoto]] as {{nihongo|Professor Sasaki|\u4f50\u3005\u6728\u6559\u6388}}\n*[[Ry\u014dko Hirosue]] as {{nihongo|Saito Takako|\u6589\u85e4\u8cb4\u5b50}}\n*[[Kosuke Toyohara]] as {{nihongo|Sugisaki Tetsuya|\u6749\u5d0e\u54f2\u4e5f}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n*Hidetoshi Sena (24) \u2013 An ambitious pianist with dreams of the big time. After graduating from music school, he teaches at a children's piano school for a small income. He lives in an apartment with a baby grand piano in the living room. Sena practises for piano competitions throughout the series. Despite his seemingly very adept technical ability and Sasaki's high opinion of Sena's playing, Sena constantly meets with failure. The reason for this becomes clearer as the story unfolds. Momoko calls him \"Ayrton\" because his surname resembles that of former motor-racing world champion [[Ayrton Senna]]. He suffers many harsh remarks from arrogant student Takako, but still helps her in her struggle with life.\n*Minami Hayama (31) \u2013 An independent and uninhibited 30-year-old woman. Once in demand as a fashion model, she now works as a small-time model on increasingly infrequent jobs. She is unlucky in love: Her fianc\u00e9 elopes with a younger woman on their wedding day. Through a series of circumstances, Minami comes to stay in Sena's house. Their deepening relationship is a main thread of the drama.\n*Shinji Hayama \u2013 Minami's younger brother. A loafer and notorious womanizer, he is also a talented pianist who is later revealed to have had a promising piano career. He comes to Tokyo with his girlfriend Rumiko, relying on [[pachinko]] winnings to foot the bill. He later buys a bar and runs it with her.\n*Ryoko Okusawa \u2013 A very talented pianist but shy with a sheltered upbringing. She is a student in the same music school that Sena graduated from and considered a future star. Sena develops a crush on her but she seems indifferent toward him. Shinji briefly seduces her but later leaves her.\n*Momoko Koishikawa \u2013 Minami's junior in the modelling company and a close friend of Minami. Despite her ditzy manner, she sometimes makes insightful observations and offers useful advice.\n*Rumiko Himuro \u2013 Shinji's girlfriend.\n*Professor Sasaki \u2013 Sena's mentor and former professor. He often encourages Sena to enter piano competitions.\n*Takako Saito \u2013 A child prodigy who is taught by Sena for a brief time. Initially, her attitude toward Sena is disrespectful.\n*Tetsuya Sugisaki \u2013 A dashing professional photographer who falls for Minami.\n\n==Ratings==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Episode\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Rating (%)\n|-\n| 01\n| 15 April 1996\n| 30.6\n|-\n| 02\n| 22 April 1996\n| 28.3\n|-\n| 03\n| 29 April 1996\n| 29.0\n|-\n| 04\n| 6 May 1996\n| 27.6\n|-\n| 05\n| 13 May 1996\n| 27.9\n|-\n| 06\n| 20 May 1996\n| 25.5\n|-\n| 07\n| 27 May 1996\n| 27.7\n|-\n| 08\n| 3 June 1996\n| 29.9\n|-\n| 09\n| 10 June 1996\n| 29.1\n|-\n| 10\n| 17 June 1996\n| 28.6\n|-\n| 11\n| 24 June 1996\n| 36.7\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://jdorama.com/drama.239.htm JDorama entry]\n* {{IMDb title|0116910|Long Vacation}}\n\n\n[[Category:1996 Japanese television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1996 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:Japanese drama television series]]\n[[Category:Works about pianos and pianists]]\n[[Category:Fuji Television dramas]]\n", "name_user": "Linda Evans L", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Vacation"}

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

Colby]]. Hewitt and Colby had previously met in [[Wisconsin]], where they operated lumber and maritime businesses, respectively, and in [[Tacoma, Washington]], from which the voyage began. The pair sought to build an industrial center at a site they speculated would be the first ocean port for [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], to be constructed by [[James J.

The area had an estimated population of 5,000 by the end of the year, shortly before the completion of the Great Northern Railway across [[Stevens Pass]] on January 6, 1893. The railroad did not terminate in Everett as originally hoped, instead continuing along the shoreline of Puget Sound to [[Seattle]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|pages=20\u201321}}\n\n===Incorporation and early years===\n\nFollowing the acquisition of tidelands on the waterfront, which had been in dispute, the Everett Land Company allowed for a municipal government to be formed.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|pages=20\u201321}} The initial city boundaries were set by the company to exclude industrial areas to avoid taxation, as well as the town of [[Lowell, Everett, Washington|Lowell]], which pre-dated Everett.

The company's investment into the [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] area yielded ore of poorer quality than expected and it was unable to meet the promises in the \"Remarkable Document\", which was amended several times with the Rucker Brothers, by then junior partners in the company.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=119}} Rockefeller called his investment into question and appointed advisory Frederick Gates to begin divestment while Colby and Hoyt remained as the leaders of the company.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=119}} Several of the major businesses in Everett closed or failed during the three-year height of the economic depression, but work on [[Alexander McDougall (ship designer)|Alexander McDougall]]'s [[Whaleback]] was finished with the launch of {{SS|City of Everett}} in October 1894, the largest to be built on Puget Sound at the time.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=23}} The Everett Women's Book Club was established in 1894 and opened the city's first [[hospital]] and [[public library]], which would later expand into the [[Everett Public Library]] system.<ref>{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=April 14, 2019 |title=Everett''s museum salutes book club celebrating 125 years |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/everetts-museum-salutes-book-club-celebrating-125-years/ |work=The Everett Herald |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter outside investors withdrew in 1895, the Everett Land Company's holdings were transferred to the [[Everett Improvement Company]], controlled by James J. Hill.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=356\u2013357}} The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nAmid the \"hard times\", Everett launched a campaign to become [[county seat]] by replacing [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]], which had waned in importance following the completion of several railroads. An election to determine which city would be named county seat was scheduled for November 6, 1894, beginning a heated debate by citizens and newspapers.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}} The initial count by the commissioners was announced on December 19 in Everett's favor, amid accusations of fraud and bought votes from both sides. Following an appeal from Snohomish, thee [[Washington Supreme Court]] declared the result to be invalid and blocked the move, but a recount by the commissioners in October 1895 remained in Everett's favor.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=136\u2013137}} A long legal battle was fought between the two cities and was decided in October 1895 by the Supreme Court, who ruled that Everett would become county seat per the legal and binding recount.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|p=139}} In January 1897, the county government's records were moved by wagons from Snohomish to Everett, where a three-story [[courthouse]] was opened on February 1, 1898.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}}{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|p=140}}\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

The area had an estimated population of 5,000 by the end of the year, shortly before the completion of the Great Northern Railway across [[Stevens Pass]] on January 6, 1893.

The company's investment into the [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] area yielded ore of poorer quality than expected and it was unable to meet the promises in the \"Remarkable Document\", which was amended several times with the Rucker Brothers, by then junior partners in the company.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=119}} Rockefeller called his investment into question and appointed advisory Frederick Gates to begin divestment while Colby and Hoyt remained as the leaders of the company.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=119}} Several of the major businesses in Everett closed or failed during the three-year height of the economic depression, but work on [[Alexander McDougall (ship designer)|Alexander McDougall]]'s [[Whaleback]] was finished with the launch of {{SS|City of Everett}} in October 1894, the largest to be built on Puget Sound at the time.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=23}} The Everett Women's Book Club was established in 1894 and opened the city's first [[hospital]] and [[public library]], which would later expand into the [[Everett Public Library]] system.<ref>{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=April 14, 2019 |title=Everett''s museum salutes book club celebrating 125 years |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/everetts-museum-salutes-book-club-celebrating-125-years/ |work=The Everett Herald |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter outside investors withdrew in 1895, the Everett Land Company's holdings were transferred to the [[Everett Improvement Company]], controlled by James J. Hill.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=356\u2013357}} The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nAmid the \"hard times\", Everett launched a campaign to become [[county seat]] by replacing [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]], which had waned in importance following the completion of several railroads. An election to determine which city would be named county seat was scheduled for November 6, 1894, beginning a heated debate by citizens and newspapers.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}} The initial count by the commissioners was announced on December 19 in Everett's favor, amid accusations of fraud and bought votes from both sides. Following an appeal from Snohomish, thee [[Washington Supreme Court]] declared the result to be invalid and blocked the move, but a recount by the commissioners in October 1895 remained in Everett's favor.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=136\u2013137}} A long legal battle was fought between the two cities and was decided in October 1895 by the Supreme Court, who ruled that Everett would become county seat per the legal and binding recount.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|p=139}} In January 1897, the county government's records were moved by wagons from Snohomish to Everett, where a three-story [[courthouse]] was opened on February 1, 1898.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}}{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|p=140}}\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W.
