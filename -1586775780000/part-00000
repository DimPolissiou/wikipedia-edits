In early 1968 the U.S. Army\u2019s [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] moved to [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] to conduct [[Operation Jeb Stuart]] and to participate in [[Battle of Khe Sanh#Operation Pegasus|Operation Pegasus]], the relief of [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]]. On 27 January 1968 [[COMUSMACV]] General [[William Westmoreland]] ordered the establishment of a new [[MACV]]/ARVN headquarters (known as MACV Forward) at [[Phu Bai Combat Base]] to control the war in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province]]s. MACV Forward would be commanded by deputy COMUSMACV General [[Creighton Abrams]].

Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. [[Toy Story 3|Years later]], a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to an environment where he is not the favorite as he was with Andy, apparent when Bonnie takes Woody's sheriff badge and puts it on [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] instead, not even bothering to give him a role during her playtime.\n\nOn the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic [[spork]]. Bonnie uses these to create a bipedal spork with googly eyes, whom she dubs \"[[Forky]]\". Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an [[existential crisis]], thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away.\n\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a [[road trip]], Forky jumps out of the RV window, and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a [[Chatty Cathy|talking doll]] named Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep Billy, Goat, and Gruff, who now live as \"lost\" toys that are not dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] searches for Woody but gets lost at a fairground and becomes a [[carnival game]] prize. He escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and they meet up with Woody and Bo. With the help of [[Polly Pocket|pocket toy]] cop Giggle McDimples and stuntman toy Duke Caboom, they unsuccessfully try to rescue Forky from Gabby, her [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist puppet]] henchmen, and the store owner's cat. In the aftermath of the failed rescue, Bo and the other toys argue over whether to go back. Woody declares that rescuing Forky is his remaining purpose and tells Bo that being loyal is something a lost toy wouldn't understand. Alone, Woody encounters Gabby again, who expresses her longing for a child's love. Woody sympathizes with her plight and willingly trades his voice box for Forky.\n\nThe toys part ways, but Woody watches Gabby as she is rejected by her ideal owner, Harmony. Woody comforts a heartbroken Gabby and invites her to become one of Bonnie's toys. Bo returns with the others to help and reconciles with Woody. They head for the carnival, while Forky fetches Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents.\n\nAt the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye, but Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again. After Buzz tells Woody that Bonnie will be okay even without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo instead of returning to Bonnie. Woody passes his sheriff badge over to Jessie and bids a heartfelt farewell to his friends.\n\nWoody and Bo begin a life together with Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie creates a second impromptu toy out of a plastic knife, who suffers the same existential crisis as Forky once did, who immediately becomes smitten with her.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]<ref name=YahooHanksUpdate />\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]<ref name=\"TheWrap\" />\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]<ref name=\"bo peep\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|title='Toy Story 4': Bo Peep Officially Returns in New Teaser|first=Charles|last=Ridgley|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2019|work=Comicbook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128225301/https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Hale]] as [[Forky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|title=Toy Story 4 Teaser Trailer Introduces New Non-Toy Character|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210851/https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\" TheHollywood Reporter\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |title='Toy Story 4' Teaser Trailer Introduces New Toy Forky |date=November 12, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=November 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210905/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |archivedate=November 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ducky|Ducky]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\" />\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bunny|Bunny]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|title=Toy Story 4: New trailer introduces Ducky and Bunny, played by Key and Peele|website=IGN|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113155053/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355|title=Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip|first=Dan|last=Neilan|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|work=[[The A.V.

Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. [[Toy Story 3|Years later]], a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to an environment where he is not the favorite as he was with Andy, apparent when Bonnie takes Woody's sheriff badge and puts it on [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] instead, not even bothering to give him a role during her playtime.\n\nOn the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic [[spork]]. Bonnie uses these to create a bipedal spork with googly eyes, whom she dubs \"[[Forky]]\". Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an [[existential crisis]], thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away.\n\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a [[road trip]], Forky jumps out of the RV window, and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a [[Chatty Cathy|talking doll]] named Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep Billy, Goat, and Gruff, who now live as \"lost\" toys that aren't dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] searches for Woody but becomes lost at a fairground and becomes a [[carnival game]] prize. He escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and they meet up with Woody and Bo. With the help of [[Polly Pocket|pocket toy]] cop Giggle McDimples and stuntman toy Duke Caboom, they unsuccessfully try to rescue Forky from Gabby, her [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist puppet]] henchmen, and the store owner's cat. In the aftermath of the failed rescue, Bo and the other toys argue over whether to go back. Woody declares that rescuing Forky is his remaining purpose and tells Bo that being loyal is something a lost toy wouldn't understand. Alone, Woody encounters Gabby again, who expresses her longing for a child's love. Woody sympathizes with her plight and willingly trades his voice box for Forky.\n\nThe toys part ways, but Woody watches Gabby as she is rejected by her ideal owner, Harmony. Woody comforts a heartbroken Gabby and invites her to become one of Bonnie's toys. Bo returns with the others to help and reconciles with Woody. They head for the carnival, while Forky fetches Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents.\n\nAt the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye, but Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again. After Buzz tells Woody that Bonnie will be okay even without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo instead of returning to Bonnie. Woody passes his sheriff badge over to Jessie and bids a heartfelt farewell to his friends.\n\nWoody and Bo begin a life together with Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie creates a second impromptu toy out of a plastic knife, who suffers the same existential crisis as Forky once did, who immediately becomes smitten with her.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]<ref name=YahooHanksUpdate />\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]<ref name=\"TheWrap\" />\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]<ref name=\"bo peep\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|title='Toy Story 4': Bo Peep Officially Returns in New Teaser|first=Charles|last=Ridgley|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2019|work=Comicbook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128225301/https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Hale]] as [[Forky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|title=Toy Story 4 Teaser Trailer Introduces New Non-Toy Character|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210851/https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\" TheHollywood Reporter\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |title='Toy Story 4' Teaser Trailer Introduces New Toy Forky |date=November 12, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=November 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210905/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |archivedate=November 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ducky|Ducky]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\" />\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bunny|Bunny]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|title=Toy Story 4: New trailer introduces Ducky and Bunny, played by Key and Peele|website=IGN|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113155053/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355|title=Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip|first=Dan|last=Neilan|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|work=[[The A.V.

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close. Several further emergency regulations have been enacted by the CCA to address the various challenges presented by the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation or postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), and fears of supply shortages have resulted in [[panic buying]].

They were the first team of Power Rangers to be granted powers entirely through Earth human technology, and not through mystic forces, wild beasts, or by alien technology. They were also the first Power Ranger team whose identities were known to the public because they are public servants and thus have no need to hide their identity.\n\n===Carter Grayson===\nCarter Grayson is the main [[protagonist]] of the series, a [[firefighter]] and the Red Lightspeed Ranger. He is the serious and devoted leader of the Lightspeed team. He risked his life with his daredevil maneuvers, but always saved those in danger.\n\nWhen he was a child, Carter was rescued from a burning building by William Mitchell. It was because of the firefighter that Carter decided he wanted to be a firefighter as well. Following a firefighter duty where he got a brief glimpse of Ghouligan, Carter was approached by Dana and two of Captain Mitchell's men and brought to the Lightspeed Aquabase by them.\n\nHe was the first to accept his role as a Lightspeed Power Ranger. He was also chosen to utilize the powers of the Titanium Morpher, but was unable to, as it proved too powerful for a normal human, despite his large muscles. He bravely took down Queen Bansheera in the final battle with the Demons, hurling her into the Shadow World for good. Carter returned to Firefighting after his time at Lightspeed Rescue.\n\nDuring the series, he develops serious romantic feelings for Dana, the Pink Ranger, and it appeared to be mutual. It is unknown if they became a couple afterwards, even though they were the only Lightspeed Rangers seen together prior to the final battle of ''[[Power Rangers: Super Megaforce]]''.\n\nWhen Vypra returned from the dead and began terrorizing Silver Hills, Carter reunited the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers, who helped the [[Time Force Power Rangers|Time Force Rangers]] defeat her. When the Machine Empire's forces unearthed Zedd's Serpentera to destroy Earth, Carter teamed up with nine other Red Rangers and travelled to the moon to stop them in the Wild Force episode \"Forever Red \"he also gets Cole. and Carter saves a girl who had become a hostage for the Red Rangers. He and Dana later appeared to help victims of the Warstar Armada's attack in ''Super Megaforce'', and again with their teammates in the final battle.\n\nCarter survives capture during the events of \"Shattered Grid\" while his other teammates are captured by Drakon. He reveals his identity as a fire fighter to his fellow Rangers when Jen and Kimberly arrive with Karone in tow and offers aid.  He later joins his fellow Rangers in a fight against Drakon's forces, however his powers are blasted away by Drakon's cannons before he and his allies are taken away from Corinth.\n\nCarter is played by Sean Cw Johnson.\n\n===Chad Lee===\nChad Lee is the Blue Lightspeed Ranger and the team's [[second-in-command]], known for his aquatic skills. He often spends time [[scuba diving]], feeling connected to the marine life. He was working at a marine park when Captain Mitchell's men picked him up.\n\nChad brings to the team his exceptional martial arts ability, and water rescue skills. Chad studied under a karate master named Tomashiro, who felt that Chad's true destiny was as a martial arts master and not a Ranger. Tomashiro then helped train a monster named Cyclopter, hoping to replace Chad as his best student (Cyclopter even defeated Chad in battle), until Cyclopter turned on him. Chad remembers everything Tomashiro taught him then and defeats Cyclopter, and Tomashiro even comes to ask Chad for a tour of the Aqua Base. Chad also temporarily had a relationship with the mermaid Marina, but they parted ways eventually. Chad becomes close with Yellow Ranger Kelsey during the series.\n\nAfter leaving Lightspeed, Chad became a [[lifeguard]], but returned to help his team fight an undead Vypra with the Time Force Rangers, and again in ''Super Megaforce'' alongside other veteran Rangers in battling the last forces of the Armada.\n\nChad is played by [[Michael Chaturantabut]].\n\n===Joel Rawlings===\nJoel Rawlings is an aerial [[stunt performer|stuntman]] under the name \"The Sky Cowboy\" and is recruited by Captain Mitchell to be the Green Lightspeed Ranger.\n\nFollowing one of his aerial acts at an air show, Joel was approached by Captain Mitchell's men and brought to the Lightspeed Aquabase. He is extremely reluctant to become a Power Ranger at first, not believing in Lightspeed or what it has to offer. But when he sees his beloved Mariner Bay in danger, he decides to take them up on their offer.\n\nHe shows interest in the Rangers' assistant, Ms. Angela Fairweather. In the epilogue of the finale episode, Rawlings and Ms. Fairweather are about to go out on their first date when he is called away on Ranger business, unable to let his duties end with the Demons. He eventually marries her, and the two are seen heading off on their honeymoon right before he returns to the team to help battle Vypra with the Time Force Power Rangers. He would later join his teammates in the final battle with the Armada forces in ''Super Megaforce.''\n\nJoel is played by [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]].\n\n===Kelsey Winslow===\nKelsey is extremely active physically, being a professional mountain climber and overall extreme sports enthusiast. She takes the job as the Lightspeed Rescue Yellow Ranger, seeing it as the most exciting thing of which she's ever heard. Kelsey recently reconciled with her grandmother, whose preoccupation with wealth and indifference towards Kelsey drove the two apart.\n\nKelsey is very much a free spirit, who loves extreme sports. She's very agile, and good at making quick decisions. However, she's also rather impulsive, hotheaded and often will attack without thinking out the consequences. This is shown when, after failing to correctly do a mission, she was nearly killed and had to be hospitalized.\n\nOut of all the Rangers, Kelsey has the closest relationship with Chad, the Blue Lightspeed Ranger. They are often seen doing activities together, like martial arts.\n\nKelsey returned to extreme sports following the collapse of Lightspeed (starting with an extreme sports comp) after defeating Queen Bansheera and her forces to save Mariner Bay.\n\nThe Lightspeed Rangers were featured in a chronicle of Power Ranger history compiled by Tommy Oliver shortly after he formed the Dino Rangers, which was found by the nascent Ranger team in the Dino Lab.\n\nKelsey and the other Lightspeed Rangers returned as part of the army of Legendary Rangers that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers.\n\nKelsey is played by [[Sasha Williams]].{{efn|Kelsey does not have a skirt with her ranger suit since her GoGoV counterpart is male.}}\n\n===Dana Mitchell===\nDana Leigh Mitchell is the daughter of Captain Mitchell and sister to Ryan Mitchell. She is an EMT and the Pink Lightspeed Ranger.\n\nDana is a tormented, reserved, stoic and compassionate young heroine who is also intellectual and level-headed. With help from two unnamed operatives, Dana gathers the team from all over Mariner Bay. Dana is a very invaluable asset to the team as one of the Rangers. She is very blunt with her words and easily gets impatient. Dana had a very brief stint as a model, but quit when she realized that being a Ranger was more important. She is later reconciled with her long-lost older brother, Ryan. During the series, she develops serious romantic feelings for Carter, the Red Ranger, and it appeared to be mutual. It is unknown if they became a couple afterwards. She often describes herself as an ugly duckling because she grew up without a mother, and later transforms into a beautiful swan. Towards the end of the series, Dana loses her fear and is stripped of her heavy burdens of her past. After Lightspeed Rescue, Dana fulfilled her dream of becoming a doctor and practices as a pediatrician. She was called into duty once more when Vypra returned and teamed with  the Time Force Rangers. She and Carter appeared unmorphed to help civilians in ''Super Megaforce'', and then again in uniform as part of the veteran Ranger army.\n\nDana is played  by [[Alison MacInnis]].\n\n===Ryan Mitchell===\nRyan Mitchell is Captain Mitchell's son and Dana Mitchell, the Pink Lightspeed Ranger's older brother. He is the Titanium Ranger.\n\nWhen Ryan was very young, he was involved in an accident along with his father, Captain Mitchell, and his sister Dana, and all three were suspended over a cliff. Captain Mitchell had a secure grasp of Dana, but Ryan was hanging on by Mitchell's shoe. The spirit of Diabolico appeared and offered a deal to Captain Mitchell....Diabolico would save the child, but in payment he would raise the child himself and Captain Mitchell would not see him again until his 20th birthday. Captain Mitchell at first refused, but relented when Ryan began to fall. Mitchell later said that it was the hardest decision he had ever made.\n\nRyan was thus raised by Diabolico and taught him that his father had rejected him, favoring Dana. Diabolico instructed Ryan to steal the prototype Titanium Morpher from the Lightspeed Base and destroy the other Power Rangers (including his sister Dana) with the Titanium Ranger power. He nearly succeeded, but Ms. Fairweather brought out the V-Lancers, which overpowered Ryan. Just as the Power Rangers were about to destroy Ryan, however, Captain Mitchell (recognizing Ryan's visible eyes) called them back and told them the back story. After some soul-searching, Ryan turns on Diabolico and joins the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers. Because of Ryan's treachery, Diabolico did a dream attack where he placed a curse on him in the form of a cobra tattoo which would get closer to his neck every time he morphed until it destroyed him. Ryan eventually found and destroyed the Cobra Monster that was the source of the curse, breaking the curse.\n\nAfter a while, Ryan left to find more information about the demons and find a way to defeat them. This was because of the lack of a storyline in the Sentai footage. He would eventually return to join the Rangers in the final battle and return his morpher to Lightspeed Rescue.\n\nIn ''Power Rangers Time Force'', Ryan shows up again to help the Lightspeed and Time Force Rangers to battle Vypra when she summons the super demon Quarganon, appearing alongside Quantum Ranger Eric Myers. He would also join the veteran Ranger army in ''Super Megaforce.''\n\nHe is the first non-Super Sentai Ranger, followed by the A-Squad Rangers in SPD and the Spirit Rangers in Jungle Fury. He is also the only non-Super Sentai Sixth Ranger as there was no Sixth Ranger in [[Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive|GoGoV]]. The Titanium Ranger's design is also noticeably different from the original GoGoV uniforms. The uniform is based on the suit designs of [[Kousoku Sentai Turboranger|Turboranger]], with minor tweaks such as a Lightspeed belt, gloves, boots and gold shoulder pads. The helmet is modeled after the Lightspeed helmet (single color and no mouthpiece) and its visor is modeled after the V from the original Sentai title. This helmet was later recreated for ''Super Megaforce'', but with the error of a piece previously hidden by the visor being visible outside it. He was also the only Ranger-exclusive hero featured in the battle.\n\nRyan is played by [[Rhett Fisher]].\n\n==Allies of the Power Rangers==\n\n===Captain William Mitchell===\nCaptain William Mitchell is the captain of the Lightspeed Aquabase, mentor to the Lightspeed Rangers, and father of [[Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers#Dana Mitchell|Dana]] and [[Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers#Ryan Mitchell|Ryan Mitchell]].\n\nIn his earlier life, he once worked as a [[firefighter]] that saved a young Carter.\n\nLater on, he was involved in a car accident that left him, Dana, and Ryan hanging from a cliff. Captain Mitchell had a secure grasp of a bleeding Dana, but a frightened Ryan was hanging on by Mitchell's leg. The spirit of Diabolico appeared and offered a deal to Captain Mitchell...Diabolico would save the child. But in payment, he would raise the child himself and Captain Mitchell would not see him again until his 20th birthday. Captain Mitchell at first refused, but relented when Ryan began to fall. Mitchell later said that it was the hardest decision he had ever made. Captain Mitchell is often tormented by nightmares of Dana and Ryan getting killed, which leads to over protectiveness of both of them, but later learns that his children had just been knocked out.\n\nUpon the release of the Demons, Captain Mitchell was responsible for gathering the ones that became the Lightspeed Rangers (chosen for their special abilities) by sending Dana and two unnamed operatives to pick them up. When Ryan had recently reappeared, Mitchell successfully convinced him to leave Diabolico's side and join him as the Titanium Ranger. Captain Mitchell cares for Ryan and Dana with fierce devotion, rescuing them in very dangerous moments, such as when Dana was captured and he went after her himself. Another time was when Ryan was trapped in the Cobra's lair and Captain Mitchell freed him.\n\nCaptain Mitchell is played by Ron Rogg\u00e9.\n\n===Angela Fairweather===\nMs. Angela Fairweather is the Lightspeed Aquabase's residential scientist and Ranger Expert. Before Kat Manx, Ms. Fairweather developed Zords, weaponry, and vehicles for the Rangers. She is the sister of Clark Fairweather who is also a Ranger expert. Ms. Fairweather is often seen and recognized for wearing black sheer pantyhose.\n\nThroughout the series, Joel Rawlings often flirts with Ms. Fairweather, though she initially wasn't interested in him (once even lying to him saying there was a protocol and at Lightspeed saying that Lightspeed members couldn't interact with each other). In the final episode, she finally consents to go on a date with him.\n\nHalf a season later, in the \"Time for Lightspeed\" team-up, the two are seen heading off to their honeymoon. When Joel is contacted by Carter, Ms. Fairweather convinces him to help Carter.\n\nMs. Fairweather is played by [[Monica Louwerens]].\n\n===Marina===\nMarina is a lovely [[mermaid]] who was romantically interested in Chad Lee and is the daughter of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. She was used by Vypra in a botched plan against Chad.\n\nTaking on human legs, Marina later asked for Chad's help in recovering her father's trident from Aquafiend.\n\nMarina is played by Kamera Walton.\n\n==Antagonists==\nFive thousand years ago, a faction of evil [[demon]]s had plans to destroy and conquer the Earth. They were sealed away in the Tomb of Forever by a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|warlock]]. In the present day, a group of wandering nomads accidentally freed the demons. The demons are angry to find that humans have built the city of Mariner Bay over their former palace and vow to get it back. They also worked to revive Queen Bansheera. The leader of the demons at any one time (below Bansheera herself) wielded the ''Star Power''. This Star Power was passed from its initial owner Diabolico to Bansheera's son Olympius during the course of the series as Bansheera awaits the day to release the demons from the Shadow World.\n\n===Queen Bansheera===\nQueen Bansheera (whose name is based on the [[Banshee]] of Irish Mythology) is the evil monarch of the demons. She was in parts unknown when Diabolico and his band were freed, but eventually joins her subjects in the Skull Cavern by adopting a form made of pure energy. Her son Prince Olympius enacts a ceremony to restore her physical form with the help of Spellbinder. Due to the Rangers' interference, the ceremony is only able to bring Bansheera back in a rudimentary, cocoon-like form. Later on, she absorbs Vypra's life energy to complete her resurrection and regain her true body.\n\nOnce restored, Bansheera sets out for world domination, proving far more ruthless than Diabolico or Olympius. She forces Diabolico to destroy Loki, leaves her own son in the Shadow World, and nearly destroys the Rangers. A vengeful Diabolico reveals her weak spot - her heart - to Carter, but she continues to menace the Rangers. She eventually turned Diabolico and Olympius into Super Demons, but they are defeated (after destroying several Megazords).\n\nFor her final plan, Bansheera intends to open a portal to the Shadow World (disguised as a sarcophagus) to free all the demons from the Shadow World. Taking over the Aquabase and the Omega Megazord, she was close to succeeding. However, Carter kicks her into the portal, forcing Bansheera to grab him in an attempt to drag him with her. During the final struggle, Diabolico's spirit intervenes as Queen Bansheera tells Diabolico that he was just in time to help. Diabolico reveals that he is actually here to help the Rangers defeat her as severing his queen's tentacles with an energy blast. Howling in defeat, Bansheera falls into the Shadow World where she is mauled by the hordes of demons within.\n\nQueen Bansheera is voiced by [[Diane Salinger]].\n\n===Prince Olympius===\nPrince Olympius was the [[dragon]]-like son of Queen Bansheera and the prince of the demons. His father is never mentioned. At the beginning of the series, he is still an infant demon, named Impus, who was cared for by the Demons in his mother's absence. As Bansheera repeatedly threatened to give Impus Diabolico's Star Power, the baby demon served as the primary threat and motivation for Diabolico's quest to destroy Mariner Bay and the Lightspeed Rangers. Eventually, Impus gained the Star Power when Diabolico was destroyed for the first time, causing him to encase himself in a red and black cocoon. Soon after, he completed his evolution and emerged from the cocoon as Olympius. He took Diabolico's place as the Rangers' main antagonist, but his youth and inexperience left him less adept than his predecessor.\n\nShortly after his metamorphosis, he gained access to the Aquabase by capturing four of the Rangers, enabling him to assume their forms. Carter Grayson (the Red Lightspeed Ranger) was able to see right through him and foiled his plans, resulting in Olympius falling into the sea. Exposure to water caused Olympius to lose most of his personal power, including his ability to shape-shift. No longer a physical match for the Rangers or his fellow demons, Olympius found himself forced into a subservient position as Vypra and Loki took command of the demon forces.\n\nDespite his decreased power, Olympius still managed to cause trouble for the Rangers. In one battle, he actually destroyed the Rangers by using a device that allowed him to use the Rescue Bird against them. Unfortunately for him, Carter's experimental Mobile Armor Vehicle malfunctioned, sending the Red Ranger back in time. Realizing what had happened, Carter was able to change history and prevent Olympius from pulling the trigger on the other Lightspeed Rangers. Olympius has a strong hatred for Carter and repeatedly attempts to capture him, but his attempts are always unsuccessfully carried out.\n\nEventually, Olympius managed to revive Queen Bansheera, but instead of treating him like a prince, she treated him as just another expendable pawn like the rest of her minions. His plans to win her affection were unsuccessful, causing him to quickly lose her favor. When he discovered that Vypra and Loki were to take his place as second-in-command, he plotted to eliminate them by using the monster, Vilevine, to bury the two of them alive. Vypra and Loki survived and resurrected Diabolico during Olympius' next attempt to destroy the Rangers by having the Shadow World's Gatekeeper trap the Rangers in the Shadow World, roaming with defeated demons. However, he himself became trapped at Diabolico's bidding when the gateway was destroyed and the key was stolen - to add insult to injury, the Rangers eventually escaped.\n\nTo escape the Shadow World, Olympius began defeating the other occupants of the realm, absorbing their energy and evolving into a more powerful, monstrous form. Meanwhile, Jinxer - still loyal to the demon prince - hypnotized Captain Mitchell, commanding him to place a Star Power link inside the Aquabase generator to provide Olympius with more energy. After breaking free of the Shadow World, Olympius seem unstoppable until Ms. Fairweather broke the link to the Aquabase's energy, weakening Olympius enough for the Rangers to defeat him and destroy his Star Power. He was left under the care of Jinxer for a short time, regaining his strength.\n\nUpon recovering his power, Olympius took revenge on Diabolico by besting him in battle and having his mother turn Diabolico into a mindless slave. With his new minion in tow, Olympius attacked the Rangers, but his plans were derailed when Diabolico regained his mind and rebelled against Olympius. Although the demon prince was able to destroy Diabolico once again, the Rangers used the opportunity to destroy him in turn. Queen Bansheera revived both Diabolico and Olympius in new \"Super Demon\" forms, allowing them to demolish almost all of the Megazords. Victory seemed at hand until the Rangers brought in their latest and most powerful Megazord: the Life Force Megazord, which killed the two demons once and for all.\n\nImpus was responsible for the creation of a variety of different monsters, most of them either fire-elemental (like Fireor and Trifire) or reptilian (Freezard and Infinitor). Other creatures affiliated with him included Mantevil, Vilevine, and an unhatched Monster Egg (which was predicted to grow into a giant hydra monster). After maturing into Olympius, he proved to be a noteworthy adversary to the Rangers. However, using the Star Power put a great strain on him; he had to gradually get used to his new powers. In his first encounter with the Rangers he swiftly defeated them and managed to capture four of them within the Star Power. Soon after, he used the Star Power to turn himself into nearly identical duplicates of his prisoners and used this power to infiltrate the Aquabase. However, after being weakened from exposure to water, he could no longer contain the Rangers inside the Star Power.\n\nIn battle, Olympius displayed excellent physical strength, stamina, and skills with various weaponry. He primarily used a double-bladed spear, but occasionally used some of the Rangers' own weapons against them, including Carter's Rescue Blaster and the RescueBird. Olympius also has shown the ability of [[pyrokinesis]] by expelling fire and controlling it. He is a skilled warrior, defeating an army of undead demons during his time in the Shadow World and even besting Diabolico twice (destroying him outright the second time). In his more powerful draconic form, he displayed great powers by reflecting the Rangers' weaponry and firing his own energy. However, to maintain his strength in this form he needed an external energy source (for this he drained power from the Aquabase); without a suitable energy source he was considerably hindered. Even so, he managed to survive blows from the Omega Megazord and Lightspeed Solarzord that would have normally destroyed other monsters, weakening enough only to revert him back to his normal form. In his Super Demon form, he was at the peak of his power; by combining his powers with Diabolico, he managed to destroy nearly all of the Rangers' Megazords, a feat that very few villains and monsters have achieved in the series.\n\nOlympius alters his appearance and anatomy over the series, though all his forms have a red color scheme and draconic aspects. His infant form was a mix of a [[Furby]] with a baby dragon. His second (adult) form is a humanoid dragon-like warrior with a white face. After escaping from the Shadow World, Olympius developed more demonic features, including large horns, talons, and tails, a snake-like neck, bestial musculature, and a [[Malebolgia]]-like jaw. His Super Demon form exaggerates his monstrous features in a [[Godzilla]]-like fashion, with a longer, more reptilian snout and the removal of white colors on his face.\n\nImpus is voiced by [[Brianne Siddall]] while his adult form of Olympius is voiced by [[Michael Forest]].\n\n===Diabolico===\nDiabolico (a name based on the word \"diabolical,\" whose root comes from the Spanish for \"devil\") is the primary villain for the first part of the ''Lightspeed Rescue'' series. He is a golden [[devil]]-like [[demon]] with an elongated skull, multiple horns and spikes on his head and shoulders, and a second, monstrous face on his chest. With Queen Bansheera absent and Prince Impus still an infant, Diabolico is the ''de facto'' leader of the demons. In addition to commanding the villains, Diabolico was given the Star Power by Queen Bansheera prior to his imprisonment, indicating that she considered him to be her greatest servant.\n\nSome time before the series, Diabolico appeared before Captain Mitchell and his two children when they were hanging off the edge of a cliff after a car accident. He offered to save Mitchell's son, Ryan, if he could take custody of the boy; unable to let his son fall to his doom, Mitchell reluctantly agreed. After telling Mitchell that Ryan would return on his twentieth birthday, Diabolico saved the boy from his fall and spirited him away for training as a mighty warrior.\n\nDiabolico led the demons' efforts to destroy Mariner Bay and rebuild Queen Bansheera's empire, but the Lightspeed Rangers thwarted him at every turn. After several failures, he sent Ryan - now a bitter young man - to steal the Titanium Morpher from the Aquabase and use its power against the Rangers. Unfortunately for Diabolico, Captain Mitchell was able to redeem his son, who returned the Titanium Morpher and informed Diabolico that he was severing his ties with him.\n\nQueen Bansheera quickly tired of Diabolico's failures, threatening to take his Star Power and give it to her son Impus if her general could not produce results soon. In response, Diabolico summoned his most powerful monsters - Demonite, Falkar, and Thunderon - with orders to spread explosive feathers across Mariner Bay and destroy the Rangers when they tried to interfere. The powerful demons almost succeeded in their task, but Ryan - having accepted his role as a hero - became the Titanium Ranger once again and fended off the monsters. As punishment for Ryan's interference, Diabolico cursed his one-time protege; every time he morphed, a cobra tattoo would move up his back until it reached his neck and killed him.\n\nDespite this advantage, Diabolico's monsters continued to fail against the Lightspeed Rangers. Growing increasingly desperate, Diabolico considered killing Impus himself to prevent him losing his Star Power, but lost the chance when the other demons walked in on him. In a final attempt to destroy the Power Rangers, he personally enlarged himself and engaged them in battle. He had the upper hand until Ryan - now purged of the cobra curse - joined the team, allowing them to form the Lightspeed Solarzord. This new Megazord absorbed one of Diabolico's blasts and used it to power its cannons, bombarding Diabolico until he finally fell in defeat. With his destruction, the Star Power went to Impus, who quickly matured into Olympius.\n\nAs with all defeated monsters, Diabolico's spirit was sent to the Shadow World. However, he was eventually revived by Vypra and Loki to take revenge on Olympius, who used Vilevine to try and destroy them. Diabolico immediately returned to his queen's side, attempting to regain favor with her and recapture the Star Power from Olympius. He managed to trap the demon prince in the Shadow World, but Olympius escaped, vowing vengeance on Diabolico in turn. Diabolico also thwarted the Sorcerer of the Sands' attempt to destroy Skull Cavern, annihilating the ancient wizard in the process.\n\nWhen Queen Bansheera regained her body and sent Loki to eliminate the Rangers, Diabolico overheard her declaring that she was only using Loki to try and destroy all of her foes at once. He immediately came to Loki's aid, only to be sucked into a vortex and dropped outside Skull Cavern with his fellow demon and four of the Lightspeed Rangers. During the resulting battle, Bansheera forced Diabolico to fire on the Rangers before Loki could get out of the way; the Rangers survived, but Loki did not. Infuriated at his queen's callousness, Diabolico contacted Carter (currently trying to free his friends from Skull Cavern) and revealed Bansheera's weak spot. Although Carter took Diabolico's advice and was able to free the victims of the vortex, Bansheera survived, forcing Diabolico to flee.\n\nWhile walking through a forest and fuming over the deaths of Vypra and Loki, Diabolico encountered Olympius, who had been hiding out while recovering from his last battle with the Rangers. The two demons battled fiercely, but Diabolico was defeated in the end. He was dragged back to Queen Bansheera, who turned him into Olympius' mindless pet. The two then attacked the Rangers, but some verbal pushing from Carter reawakened Diabolico's mind. As he battled Olympius, he tried to give Carter the key to the Ancient Tomb, but Olympius killed him moments before he could do so. After the Rangers killed Olympius in turn, Bansheera revived the two of them as giant Super Demons. More powerful than ever and firmly under Bansheera's control, Diabolico wreaked havoc on the city and the Rangers' Megazords alongside Olympius. It took the power of the new Lifeforce Megazord to finally destroy the two Super Demons, after which Diabolico's key flew to the Ancient Tomb and revealed the final plan of Queen Bansheera.\n\nAlthough Diabolico was destroyed, he made one final appearance at the very end of ''The Fate of Lightspeed''. While Queen Bansheera attempted to drag Carter into a portal to the Shadow World, Diabolico's spirit appeared before them and offered his help. To Bansheera's dismay, Diabolico intervened on the Rangers' behalf, severing her tentacles with a blast of energy. As the Rangers pulled Carter out and closed the tomb, Diabolico's laughing spirit forced Queen Bansheera into the Shadow World, leaving her at the mercy of the imprisoned demons.\n\nDiabolico displayed strong spiritual powers, as he was able to appear in a spiritual form even when he was imprisoned and after being destroyed. He displayed some knowledge of magic, as he recognized and countered the spell used by the Sorcerer of the Sands to try and destroy Skull Cavern. One of his odder abilities allowed him to detach his hand and send it to grab distant objects before pulling them back to himself (or sending himself to his hand's location). He could also control the weather and fire energy blasts from his hands and mouths. His weapon of choice was a skull-themed staff with axe-like blades at one end, capable of firing powerful blasts of varying form. With the Star Power, Diabolico was immensely powerful; one of his energy beams was enough to put a hole through the Super Train Megazord. Even without the Star Power, he was a competent fighter, nearly besting Olympius in their first battle.\n\nAfter being brainwashed by Queen Bansheera, Diabolico's eyes become pure black, with small arcs of electricity running across them periodically. In his Super Demon form, Diabolico takes on a more monstrous appearance, sprouting more spikes on his body and lengthening his existing horns. Instead of his staff, he wielded a jewel-encrusted sword as his weapon. His power was at its absolute peak in this form; alongside Olympius, he destroyed nearly all of the Rangers' Megazords, a feat that only the strongest monsters and villains in the ''Power Rangers'' franchise can achieve.\n\nSome subliminal messages suggest that Diabolico is Olympius' father: he was clearly a favorite of Bansheera (presumably an ex-lover), the other demons saw him as a kind of a king consort under their queen, and Olympius was expected to succeed him as the owner of the Star Power.\n\nDiabolico also appears as the sixth and final boss in ''Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue'' for [[Game Boy Color]].\n\nDiabolico is voiced by [[Neil Kaplan]].\n\n===Vypra===\nVypra is one of only two female [[demon]]s, along with Queen Bansheera. She is the most human-looking demon, resembling a young, dark-haired woman wearing serpentine armor and bat-like wings. She is skilled in dark magic. Initially, Vypra was considered a motherly figure to the young Impus, but she began to look down on him as an immature leader after he matured into Olympius.\n\nVypra personally led several attacks on the Rangers over the course of the series. In combat, she primarily used a thin saber that could unleash energy disks. She also piloted the Vyprari, a swift vehicle resembling a modified dune buggy. She almost never took hits, particularly because her armor does not fully cover her torso, but apparently she was vulnerable to damage, because in at least one episode, Carter was able to hold her up by threatening to shoot her.\n\nAfter Olympius lost favor with his mother, he discovered that she was considering making Loki and Vypra second in command. He plotted to eliminate them by having Vilevine bury them alive. Loki and Vypra retaliated by bringing back Diabolico from the dead to deal with him. Having failed in her last attempt to destroy the Rangers, Vypra was absorbed by Queen Bansheera to use her energy to regain a bodily form.\n\nIn the \"Time for Lightspeed\" episode of ''[[Power Rangers Time Force]]'' after Bansheera's defeat, Vypra is seen emerging from a graveyard and returns from the dead with an army of undead soldiers. She teams up with the mutant Ransik to obtain an artifact called the Solar Amulet. With its Dark Magic from the Shadow World and the sun being in perfect alignment with the stars, she used its power to revive the Super Demon Quarganon in Silver Hills. However, she was killed again by [[Wesley Collins]] (Red Time Force Ranger) with his Red Battle Warrior and Quarganon by Carter with his Trans-Armor Cycle. Her resurrection is never explained.\n\nVypra is played by Jennifer L. Yen (episodes 1; 4-37) and Wen Yann Shih (episodes 2-3).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793390/</ref>\n\n===Loki===\nLoki (pronounced \"Low-Kai\") is a fierce and loyal [[Kobold]]-like demon warrior and friend to Diabolico (to whom Loki gave a spider/scorpion-shaped amulet to as a token of their millennia-long friendship) and Vypra. He serves as the dumb muscle of the demons, and was considered expendable by Queen Bansheera despite his loyalty.\n\nThe monsters Loki created were mainly earth-elemental, including Quakemon and Elestomp. In battle, Loki normally used a two-pronged staff as his weapon, but in \"The Wrath of the Queen\", the final episode he appeared in, he used a bazooka that was in the shape of a dragon's head. Loki could also expel electricity from his eyes.\n\nWhen Diabolico was destroyed for the first time, Loki and Vypra were anguished by his death and considered the newly matured Olympius as a mere child who would not make a suitable leader, Loki refuses to take abuse from Olympius. After losing favor with his mother, Olympius discovered that Bansheera considered making Vypra and Loki the new second in command and plotted to eliminate them by having Vilevine bury them alive. The two managed to survive and escape to where the demons were first imprisoned and brought Diabolico back to life to help get rid of Olympius.\n\nAfter regaining her body (at the expense of Vypra's life), Queen Bansheera allowed Loki to personally go after the Rangers, calling him her \"favorite\" servant. In truth, however, Loki was being used in a plan to destroy the Power Rangers when Diabolico tries to warn him; during the resulting battle, Bansheera telepathically took control of Diabolico's body and forced him to use Loki's bazooka to take aim at the Rangers, an act that would also risk harming Loki. The Rangers managed to survive the blast, but he was fatally wounded, Loki should had listen to Diabolico and died in his arms, his body exploding and reduced to ash in the typical way monsters were destroyed. This proved to be the final straw for Diabolico, who began actively working against his queen to avenge the death of his friend.\n\nLoki is voiced by [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]].\n\n===Jinxer===\nJinxer (whose name is based on the term \"jinx\") is a [[fly]]-like demon who served Queen Bansheera and her henchmen. He was highly insightful and skilled in the ways of magic. He specialized in using magic cards for various purposes such as summoning Batlings, creating monsters, and empowering or reviving fallen demons. He was also skilled in use of hypnotism and magical artifacts. He was a cowardly sort of villain, relying on his summoned monsters and Batlings, but he did battle the Rangers at least a few times. His method of attacking was using a cane-like blaster.\n\nHe is extremely loyal to Olympius, supporting him even after the villain was trapped in the Shadow World. In \"''Olympius Unbound''\", Jinxer devises a plan to free the demon prince; disguising himself as hypnotist Mr. Mesmer (played by Benton Jennings), he plants an evil suggestion in Captain Mitchell's subconscious. While Olympius defeats demon spirits in the Shadow World to gain enough power to return to the living world, Jinxer puppeteers Captain Mitchell into placing a Star Power gemstone in the Aquabase's generator, diverting its power to Olympius himself. The Rangers manage to foil Olympius' plot for power, but Jinxer remains loyal, retrieving the prince's body and hiding him in a cave to tend his wounds.\n\nDuring the Rangers' battle against the Super Demon forms of Diabolico and Olympius, Jinxer realized that he was out of monsters and magic spell cards; a single Batling card was all that he had left. With no other ideas, he planted the card on the leg of the Lifeforce Megazord, allowing a massive army of Batlings to invade the Aquabase and commandeer the remaining Megazords. Jinxer himself and a small faction of Batlings piloted the newly repaired Omega Megazord to place a circle of stones around Mariner Bay; their goal was to assist Queen Bansheera in opening the gateway into the Shadow World. After placing the final stone, Carter and Ryan destroyed the Omega Megazord by ramming the Mobile Armor Vehicle into it; Jinxer's final fate is never on screen, but it is assumed he and some Batlings were destroyed as well.\n\nJinxer is voiced by [[Kim Strauss]].\n\n===Troika Demons===\nThe Troika Demons are a trio of [[fallen angel]]-like [[demon]]s that serve as Diabolico's strongest servants. He saved their cards as a last resort against the Power Rangers, only unleashing them when it seemed that Queen Bansheera was planning to transfer his Star Power to Impus if he failed her again.\n\nThe Troika Demons' first attempt to destroy the Rangers involved spreading feathers from their wings across Mariner Bay - when the sun set, the feathers would explode and devastate the city. Fortunately, Lightspeed Rescue was able to retrieve almost all of the feathers (the last one was thrown away by Ryan) before the sun set. With their foes drawn into the open, the three warriors engaged the five Rangers in battle, defeating them with ease. However, they were soundly defeated in turn by Ryan, who had accepted his destiny as the Titanium Ranger.\n\nAfter returning to report their failure, the Troika Demons were sent back into the city to try again. This time, Diabolico provided them with two new advantages over the Rangers; Ryan had been cursed with a cobra tattoo that would eventually destroy him if he morphed too many times, and Demonite had been given a mirror that allowed him to create a clone of himself. With these new tricks up their sleeves, the Troika Demons tried to draw the primary Rangers away from Ryan, leaving Demonite's clone to attack the weakened Titanium Ranger. However, the clone was destroyed along with his template, with Ryan risking his life to use the Max Solarzord against Demonite's giant form.\n\nDespite the loss of their leader, Falkar and Thunderon were quickly redeployed against the Rangers, still proving to be a match for them. It was only after the Rangers managed to separate the demons that they finally overcame them, even after Falkar and Thunderon were supersized by Diabolico.\n\nFitting their ranks as Diabolico's greatest minions, the Troika Demons lasted a fairly long time against the Rangers; the fight against them made up a four-episode arc in the series (from \"Ryan's Destiny\" to \"The Cobra Strikes\"). Their members include:\n\n====Demonite====\nDemonite is a demonic [[knight]]-like warrior and the leader of the trio. In battle, he used the [[sword]] [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]] on his right hand, which was sharp enough to slice a car in two. He could also fire lasers from his eyes and left hand. He was eventually lured into a trap by the Rangers, leaving him facing a pair of guns wielded by Carter. The Red Ranger is reluctant to shoot - largely because he would risk destroying himself - but Demonite's attempt to attack forces him to fire. Although Demonite is destroyed in the blast, Jinxer revives him as a giant, more monstrous version where he no longer wears a helmet and wields two swords. Demonite's advanced form is destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. His gem is red, with the image of a sword inside of it.\n\nDemonite is voiced by [[David Stenstrom]].\n\n====Thunderon====\nThunderon is a hulking, green-skinned [[Vikings|Viking]]/[[ghoul]]-like demon with small angel wings on his back. He attacked with his brute strength, which proved great enough to actually juggle the Rangers in the air if he got a hold of them. His gauntlets were equipped with spiked knuckles to increase his punching power, and he could shoot green electricity from his eyes. He seemingly managed to defeat the Rangers, but they were faking defeat in order to blast him at close range with their V-Lancers. Thunderon was destroyed by a second combined blast, but Diabolico revived him as a giant. Unlike his comrades, his appearance did not change in the process. Despite getting backup from a reluctant Falkar, Thunderon is destroyed the Max Solarzord. His gem is green and bears an image of one of his fists.\n\nThunderon is voiced by [[Alonzo Bodden]].\n\n====Falkar====\nFalkar is an [[elf]]/[[falcon]]-themed warrior. He behaved in an effeminate manner and used a three-pronged staff, which he could use to stab opponents or as a base for a high-speed spinning attack. He could also fire blue energy beams from the eyes of his falcon-helmet. While battling the Rangers alongside Thunderon, Falkar is lured into an old building by the Pink and Yellow Rangers and buried under rubble. By the time Falkar dug himself out, the Rangers had engaged a giant Thunderon with their Megazord. Although Falkar attempts to stay on the sidelines, Diabolico finds him and advises that he joins the fight. Falkar states that he'd like to see how Thunderon does first. Diabolico insists anyway and uses an Advanced Growth Card on Falkar to force his cowardly minion into the fight. The card merged Falkar with his armor, transforming him into a more draconic-like form where he gains super-strength and can perform a spinning kick with the help of his transformed staff. Falkar is destroyed by the Max Solarzord. His gem is brown and bears an image of one of his wings.\n\nFalkar is voiced by [[Ezra Weisz]].\n\n====Troika====\nAfter each Troika demon was destroyed, their bodies transformed into a colored gem that returned to Diabolico's possession. Using these gems, Diabolico revives his minions and fuses them into Troika, a powerful chimeric warrior with white feathers/fur covering most of his body. The faces of his component demons are all present on different sides of his head with Demonite's face in the center, Thunderon's face on the left side of his head, and Falkar's face on the right side of his head. His body includes Demonite's right arm, Thunderon's left arm, and Falkar's feet, the chest is black and bears all three of the Troika Demons' gems over a white visage resembling a screaming ghost. Troika combines the best abilities of his components giving him incredible Thunderon's strength, Demonite's skill, and Falkar's speed. His main attacks include firing energy blasts from his sword arm and moving at high speeds while spinning like a top.\n\nThe Rangers had a hard time fighting Troika. Luckily for the Rangers, Miss Fairweather is able to provide them with the Battle Boosters in their next battle, allowing them to overcome Troika.\n\nTroika speaks with the voices of Demonite, Thunderon, and Falkar in unison.\n\n===Triskull===\nTriskull is a [[demon]] warrior who swears allegiance to Trakeena. He is the leader of the [[Ghoul]]s, foot soldiers Trakeena uses with the destruction of her Sting Wingers. He pretends to aid Olympius in collecting energy for Queen Bansheera, but is actually collecting it so Trakeena can return to her insectoid form. He attempts to stop the Rangers from entering the building where the energy is kept and is destroyed by the Red Galaxy and Lightspeed Rangers.\n\nTriskull's power is highly inconsistent since in the episode before his death, he easily defeated all Galaxy and Lightspeed Rangers.\n\nUnlike most villains and monsters, Triskull did not explode after being killed by the Rangers. This is due to his ''Super Sentai'' counterpart not doing so.\n\nTriskull is voiced by [[Michael Sorich]].\n\n===Batlings===\nThe Batlings are [[bat]]-like foot soldiers who are summoned from Jinxer's cards to act as the bulk of their forces. They resemble MMPR's Putty Patrollers, but have black outfits, large goggles on their eyes, and small bat wings on their helmets and backs. They use small swords in combat, and occasionally display the ability to transform into bats for ambushes.\n\n===Demons===\nThe following monsters are conjured by Diabolico and his forces through Demon Cards. To make a demon grow, Jinxer would throw a magic card into their body (or their shattered remains) and cast an incantation, transforming the demon's body into a cloud of bats that coalesce into a larger form. If an Advanced Growth card is used, the demon can manifest in an even stronger form. Queen Bansheera displayed the ability to empower monsters in a similar fashion by planting her tentacles in their bodies. She can also seal their minds away to transform them into obedient servants. When a demon is destroyed, its spirit is sent to the Shadow World where the demons becomes a largely mindless husk of its former self only concerned with destroying everything it sees (a trait made more threatening by the fact that it cannot be killed with it being already dead).\n\n* '''Ghouligan''' (voiced by [[Ken Merckx]]) - A [[fire]]-based demon.

This monster was destroyed again by the Supertrain Megazord.\n* '''Liztwin''' (voiced by [[Archie Kao]]) - A skeletal [[dinosaur]]/[[dragon]]-like demon with a dragon head for a right hand that was unleashed by Vypra to distract the Rangers while Ryan escaped.

This monster was destroyed by the Supertrain Megazord.\n* '''Demonite Clone''' (voiced by [[David Stenstrom]]) - After the Troika Monsters were defeated in battle against the Titanium Ranger, Diabolico gave the apologetic Demonite a special Mirror Card to aid the him and his fellow monsters in the battle against the Rangers. When Demonite used the Mirror Card, it created a clone of himself. This clone almost exactly resembles the original Demonite except the clone possessed two sword gauntlets instead of one and also had a blue-visor.\n* '''Cobra Monster''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) - A [[cobra]] demon with cobra-headed hands that was associated with the Cobra Tattoo that Diabolico placed on Ryan's back.

They were the first team of Power Rangers to be granted powers entirely through Earth human technology, and not through mystic forces, wild beasts, or by alien technology. They were also the first Power Ranger team whose identities were known to the public because they are public servants and thus have no need to hide their identity.\n\n===Carter Grayson===\nCarter Grayson is the main [[protagonist]] of the series, a [[firefighter]] and the Red Lightspeed Ranger. He is the serious and devoted leader of the Lightspeed team. He risked his life with his daredevil maneuvers, but always saved those in danger.\n\nWhen he was a child, Carter was rescued from a burning building by William Mitchell. It was because of the firefighter that Carter decided he wanted to be a firefighter as well. Following a firefighter duty where he got a brief glimpse of Ghouligan, Carter was approached by Dana and two of Captain Mitchell's men and brought to the Lightspeed Aquabase by them.\n\nHe was the first to accept his role as a Lightspeed Power Ranger. He was also chosen to utilize the powers of the Titanium Morpher, but was unable to, as it proved too powerful for a normal human, despite his large muscles. He bravely took down Queen Bansheera in the final battle with the Demons, hurling her into the Shadow World for good. Carter returned to Firefighting after his time at Lightspeed Rescue.\n\nDuring the series, he develops serious romantic feelings for Dana, the Pink Ranger, and it appeared to be mutual. It is unknown if they became a couple afterwards, even though they were the only Lightspeed Rangers seen together prior to the final battle of ''[[Power Rangers: Super Megaforce]]''.\n\nWhen Vypra returned from the dead and began terrorizing Silver Hills, Carter reunited the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers, who helped the [[Time Force Power Rangers|Time Force Rangers]] defeat her. When the Machine Empire's forces unearthed Zedd's Serpentera to destroy Earth, Carter teamed up with nine other Red Rangers and travelled to the moon to stop them in the Wild Force episode \"Forever Red \"he also gets Cole. and Carter saves a girl who had become a hostage for the Red Rangers. He and Dana later appeared to help victims of the Warstar Armada's attack in ''Super Megaforce'', and again with their teammates in the final battle.\n\nCarter survives capture during the events of \"Shattered Grid\" while his other teammates are captured by Drakon. He reveals his identity as a fire fighter to his fellow Rangers when Jen and Kimberly arrive with Karone in tow and offers aid.  He later joins his fellow Rangers in a fight against Drakon's forces, however his powers are blasted away by Drakon's cannons before he and his allies are taken away from Corinth.\n\nCarter is played by Sean Cw Johnson.\n\n===Chad Lee===\nChad Lee is the Blue Lightspeed Ranger and the team's [[second-in-command]], known for his aquatic skills. He often spends time [[scuba diving]], feeling connected to the marine life. He was working at a marine park when Captain Mitchell's men picked him up.\n\nChad brings to the team his exceptional martial arts ability, and water rescue skills. Chad studied under a karate master named Tomashiro, who felt that Chad's true destiny was as a martial arts master and not a Ranger. Tomashiro then helped train a monster named Cyclopter, hoping to replace Chad as his best student (Cyclopter even defeated Chad in battle), until Cyclopter turned on him. Chad remembers everything Tomashiro taught him then and defeats Cyclopter, and Tomashiro even comes to ask Chad for a tour of the Aqua Base. Chad also temporarily had a relationship with the mermaid Marina, but they parted ways eventually. Chad becomes close with Yellow Ranger Kelsey during the series.\n\nAfter leaving Lightspeed, Chad became a [[lifeguard]], but returned to help his team fight an undead Vypra with the Time Force Rangers, and again in ''Super Megaforce'' alongside other veteran Rangers in battling the last forces of the Armada.\n\nChad is played by [[Michael Chaturantabut]].\n\n===Joel Rawlings===\nJoel Rawlings is an aerial [[stunt performer|stuntman]] under the name \"The Sky Cowboy\" and is recruited by Captain Mitchell to be the Green Lightspeed Ranger.\n\nFollowing one of his aerial acts at an air show, Joel was approached by Captain Mitchell's men and brought to the Lightspeed Aquabase. He is extremely reluctant to become a Power Ranger at first, not believing in Lightspeed or what it has to offer. But when he sees his beloved Mariner Bay in danger, he decides to take them up on their offer.\n\nHe shows interest in the Rangers' assistant, Ms. Angela Fairweather. In the epilogue of the finale episode, Rawlings and Ms. Fairweather are about to go out on their first date when he is called away on Ranger business, unable to let his duties end with the Demons. He eventually marries her, and the two are seen heading off on their honeymoon right before he returns to the team to help battle Vypra with the Time Force Power Rangers. He would later join his teammates in the final battle with the Armada forces in ''Super Megaforce.''\n\nJoel is played by [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]].\n\n===Kelsey Winslow===\nKelsey is extremely active physically, being a professional mountain climber and overall extreme sports enthusiast. She takes the job as the Lightspeed Rescue Yellow Ranger, seeing it as the most exciting thing of which she's ever heard. Kelsey recently reconciled with her grandmother, whose preoccupation with wealth and indifference towards Kelsey drove the two apart.\n\nKelsey is very much a free spirit, who loves extreme sports. She's very agile, and good at making quick decisions. However, she's also rather impulsive, hotheaded and often will attack without thinking out the consequences. This is shown when, after failing to correctly do a mission, she was nearly killed and had to be hospitalized.\n\nOut of all the Rangers, Kelsey has the closest relationship with Chad, the Blue Lightspeed Ranger. They are often seen doing activities together, like martial arts.\n\nKelsey returned to extreme sports following the collapse of Lightspeed (starting with an extreme sports comp) after defeating Queen Bansheera and her forces to save Mariner Bay.\n\nThe Lightspeed Rangers were featured in a chronicle of Power Ranger history compiled by Tommy Oliver shortly after he formed the Dino Rangers, which was found by the nascent Ranger team in the Dino Lab.\n\nKelsey and the other Lightspeed Rangers returned as part of the army of Legendary Rangers that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of X Borgs and dozens of Bruisers.\n\nKelsey is played by [[Sasha Williams]].{{efn|Kelsey does not have a skirt with her ranger suit since her GoGoV counterpart is male.}}\n\n===Dana Mitchell===\nDana Leigh Mitchell is the daughter of Captain Mitchell and sister to Ryan Mitchell. She is an EMT and the Pink Lightspeed Ranger.\n\nDana is a tormented, reserved, stoic and compassionate young heroine who is also intellectual and level-headed. With help from two unnamed operatives, Dana gathers the team from all over Mariner Bay. Dana is a very invaluable asset to the team as one of the Rangers. She is very blunt with her words and easily gets impatient. Dana had a very brief stint as a model, but quit when she realized that being a Ranger was more important. She is later reconciled with her long-lost older brother, Ryan. During the series, she develops serious romantic feelings for Carter, the Red Ranger, and it appeared to be mutual. It is unknown if they became a couple afterwards. She often describes herself as an ugly duckling because she grew up without a mother, and later transforms into a beautiful swan. Towards the end of the series, Dana loses her fear and is stripped of her heavy burdens of her past. After Lightspeed Rescue, Dana fulfilled her dream of becoming a doctor and practices as a pediatrician. She was called into duty once more when Vypra returned and teamed with  the Time Force Rangers. She and Carter appeared unmorphed to help civilians in ''Super Megaforce'', and then again in uniform as part of the veteran Ranger army.\n\nDana is played  by [[Alison MacInnis]].\n\n===Ryan Mitchell===\nRyan Mitchell is Captain Mitchell's son and Dana Mitchell, the Pink Lightspeed Ranger's older brother. He is the Titanium Ranger.\n\nWhen Ryan was very young, he was involved in an accident along with his father, Captain Mitchell, and his sister Dana, and all three were suspended over a cliff. Captain Mitchell had a secure grasp of Dana, but Ryan was hanging on by Mitchell's shoe. The spirit of Diabolico appeared and offered a deal to Captain Mitchell....Diabolico would save the child, but in payment he would raise the child himself and Captain Mitchell would not see him again until his 20th birthday. Captain Mitchell at first refused, but relented when Ryan began to fall. Mitchell later said that it was the hardest decision he had ever made.\n\nRyan was thus raised by Diabolico and taught him that his father had rejected him, favoring Dana. Diabolico instructed Ryan to steal the prototype Titanium Morpher from the Lightspeed Base and destroy the other Power Rangers (including his sister Dana) with the Titanium Ranger power. He nearly succeeded, but Ms. Fairweather brought out the V-Lancers, which overpowered Ryan. Just as the Power Rangers were about to destroy Ryan, however, Captain Mitchell (recognizing Ryan's visible eyes) called them back and told them the back story. After some soul-searching, Ryan turns on Diabolico and joins the Lightspeed Rescue Rangers. Because of Ryan's treachery, Diabolico did a dream attack where he placed a curse on him in the form of a cobra tattoo which would get closer to his neck every time he morphed until it destroyed him. Ryan eventually found and destroyed the Cobra Monster that was the source of the curse, breaking the curse.\n\nAfter a while, Ryan left to find more information about the demons and find a way to defeat them. This was because of the lack of a storyline in the Sentai footage. He would eventually return to join the Rangers in the final battle and return his morpher to Lightspeed Rescue.\n\nIn ''Power Rangers Time Force'', Ryan shows up again to help the Lightspeed and Time Force Rangers to battle Vypra when she summons the super demon Quarganon, appearing alongside Quantum Ranger Eric Myers. He would also join the veteran Ranger army in ''Super Megaforce.''\n\nHe is the first non-Super Sentai Ranger, followed by the A-Squad Rangers in SPD and the Spirit Rangers in Jungle Fury. He is also the only non-Super Sentai Sixth Ranger as there was no Sixth Ranger in [[Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFive|GoGoV]]. The Titanium Ranger's design is also noticeably different from the original GoGoV uniforms. The uniform is based on the suit designs of [[Kousoku Sentai Turboranger|Turboranger]], with minor tweaks such as a Lightspeed belt, gloves, boots and gold shoulder pads. The helmet is modeled after the Lightspeed helmet (single color and no mouthpiece) and its visor is modeled after the V from the original Sentai title. This helmet was later recreated for ''Super Megaforce'', but with the error of a piece previously hidden by the visor being visible outside it. He was also the only Ranger-exclusive hero featured in the battle.\n\nRyan is played by [[Rhett Fisher]].\n\n==Allies of the Power Rangers==\n\n===Captain William Mitchell===\nCaptain William Mitchell is the captain of the Lightspeed Aquabase, mentor to the Lightspeed Rangers, and father of [[Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers#Dana Mitchell|Dana]] and [[Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers#Ryan Mitchell|Ryan Mitchell]].\n\nIn his earlier life, he once worked as a [[firefighter]] that saved a young Carter.\n\nLater on, he was involved in a car accident that left him, Dana, and Ryan hanging from a cliff. Captain Mitchell had a secure grasp of a bleeding Dana, but a frightened Ryan was hanging on by Mitchell's leg. The spirit of Diabolico appeared and offered a deal to Captain Mitchell...Diabolico would save the child. But in payment, he would raise the child himself and Captain Mitchell would not see him again until his 20th birthday. Captain Mitchell at first refused, but relented when Ryan began to fall. Mitchell later said that it was the hardest decision he had ever made. Captain Mitchell is often tormented by nightmares of Dana and Ryan getting killed, which leads to over protectiveness of both of them, but later learns that his children had just been knocked out.\n\nUpon the release of the Demons, Captain Mitchell was responsible for gathering the ones that became the Lightspeed Rangers (chosen for their special abilities) by sending Dana and two unnamed operatives to pick them up. When Ryan had recently reappeared, Mitchell successfully convinced him to leave Diabolico's side and join him as the Titanium Ranger. Captain Mitchell cares for Ryan and Dana with fierce devotion, rescuing them in very dangerous moments, such as when Dana was captured and he went after her himself. Another time was when Ryan was trapped in the Cobra's lair and Captain Mitchell freed him.\n\nCaptain Mitchell is played by Ron Rogg\u00e9.\n\n===Angela Fairweather===\nMs. Angela Fairweather is the Lightspeed Aquabase's residential scientist and Ranger Expert. Before Kat Manx, Ms. Fairweather developed Zords, weaponry, and vehicles for the Rangers. She is the sister of Clark Fairweather who is also a Ranger expert. Ms. Fairweather is often seen and recognized for wearing black sheer pantyhose.\n\nThroughout the series, Joel Rawlings often flirts with Ms. Fairweather, though she initially wasn't interested in him (once even lying to him saying there was a protocol and at Lightspeed saying that Lightspeed members couldn't interact with each other). In the final episode, she finally consents to go on a date with him.\n\nHalf a season later, in the \"Time for Lightspeed\" team-up, the two are seen heading off to their honeymoon. When Joel is contacted by Carter, Ms. Fairweather convinces him to help Carter.\n\nMs. Fairweather is played by [[Monica Louwerens]].\n\n===Marina===\nMarina is a lovely [[mermaid]] who was romantically interested in Chad Lee and is the daughter of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]. She was used by Vypra in a botched plan against Chad.\n\nTaking on human legs, Marina later asked for Chad's help in recovering her father's trident from Aquafiend.\n\nMarina is played by Kamera Walton.\n\n==Antagonists==\nFive thousand years ago, a faction of evil [[demon]]s had plans to destroy and conquer the Earth. They were sealed away in the Tomb of Forever by a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|warlock]]. In the present day, a group of wandering nomads accidentally freed the demons. The demons are angry to find that humans have built the city of Mariner Bay over their former palace and vow to get it back. They also worked to revive Queen Bansheera. The leader of the demons at any one time (below Bansheera herself) wielded the ''Star Power''. This Star Power was passed from its initial owner Diabolico to Bansheera's son Olympius during the course of the series as Bansheera awaits the day to release the demons from the Shadow World.\n\n===Queen Bansheera===\nQueen Bansheera (whose name is based on the [[Banshee]] of Irish Mythology) is the evil monarch of the demons. She was in parts unknown when Diabolico and his band were freed, but eventually joins her subjects in the Skull Cavern by adopting a form made of pure energy. Her son Prince Olympius enacts a ceremony to restore her physical form with the help of Spellbinder. Due to the Rangers' interference, the ceremony is only able to bring Bansheera back in a rudimentary, cocoon-like form. Later on, she absorbs Vypra's life energy to complete her resurrection and regain her true body.\n\nOnce restored, Bansheera sets out for world domination, proving far more ruthless than Diabolico or Olympius. She forces Diabolico to destroy Loki, leaves her own son in the Shadow World, and nearly destroys the Rangers. A vengeful Diabolico reveals her weak spot - her heart - to Carter, but she continues to menace the Rangers. She eventually turned Diabolico and Olympius into Super Demons, but they are defeated (after destroying several Megazords).\n\nFor her final plan, Bansheera intends to open a portal to the Shadow World (disguised as a sarcophagus) to free all the demons from the Shadow World. Taking over the Aquabase and the Omega Megazord, she was close to succeeding. However, Carter kicks her into the portal, forcing Bansheera to grab him in an attempt to drag him with her. During the final struggle, Diabolico's spirit intervenes as Queen Bansheera tells Diabolico that he was just in time to help. Diabolico reveals that he is actually here to help the Rangers defeat her as severing his queen's tentacles with an energy blast. Howling in defeat, Bansheera falls into the Shadow World where she is mauled by the hordes of demons within.\n\nQueen Bansheera is voiced by [[Diane Salinger]].\n\n===Prince Olympius===\nPrince Olympius was the [[dragon]]-like son of Queen Bansheera and the prince of the demons. His father is never mentioned. At the beginning of the series, he is still an infant demon, named Impus, who was cared for by the Demons in his mother's absence. As Bansheera repeatedly threatened to give Impus Diabolico's Star Power, the baby demon served as the primary threat and motivation for Diabolico's quest to destroy Mariner Bay and the Lightspeed Rangers. Eventually, Impus gained the Star Power when Diabolico was destroyed for the first time, causing him to encase himself in a red and black cocoon. Soon after, he completed his evolution and emerged from the cocoon as Olympius. He took Diabolico's place as the Rangers' main antagonist, but his youth and inexperience left him less adept than his predecessor.\n\nShortly after his metamorphosis, he gained access to the Aquabase by capturing four of the Rangers, enabling him to assume their forms. Carter Grayson (the Red Lightspeed Ranger) was able to see right through him and foiled his plans, resulting in Olympius falling into the sea. Exposure to water caused Olympius to lose most of his personal power, including his ability to shape-shift. No longer a physical match for the Rangers or his fellow demons, Olympius found himself forced into a subservient position as Vypra and Loki took command of the demon forces.\n\nDespite his decreased power, Olympius still managed to cause trouble for the Rangers. In one battle, he actually destroyed the Rangers by using a device that allowed him to use the Rescue Bird against them. Unfortunately for him, Carter's experimental Mobile Armor Vehicle malfunctioned, sending the Red Ranger back in time. Realizing what had happened, Carter was able to change history and prevent Olympius from pulling the trigger on the other Lightspeed Rangers. Olympius has a strong hatred for Carter and repeatedly attempts to capture him, but his attempts are always unsuccessfully carried out.\n\nEventually, Olympius managed to revive Queen Bansheera, but instead of treating him like a prince, she treated him as just another expendable pawn like the rest of her minions. His plans to win her affection were unsuccessful, causing him to quickly lose her favor. When he discovered that Vypra and Loki were to take his place as second-in-command, he plotted to eliminate them by using the monster, Vilevine, to bury the two of them alive. Vypra and Loki survived and resurrected Diabolico during Olympius' next attempt to destroy the Rangers by having the Shadow World's Gatekeeper trap the Rangers in the Shadow World, roaming with defeated demons. However, he himself became trapped at Diabolico's bidding when the gateway was destroyed and the key was stolen - to add insult to injury, the Rangers eventually escaped.\n\nTo escape the Shadow World, Olympius began defeating the other occupants of the realm, absorbing their energy and evolving into a more powerful, monstrous form. Meanwhile, Jinxer - still loyal to the demon prince - hypnotized Captain Mitchell, commanding him to place a Star Power link inside the Aquabase generator to provide Olympius with more energy. After breaking free of the Shadow World, Olympius seem unstoppable until Ms. Fairweather broke the link to the Aquabase's energy, weakening Olympius enough for the Rangers to defeat him and destroy his Star Power. He was left under the care of Jinxer for a short time, regaining his strength.\n\nUpon recovering his power, Olympius took revenge on Diabolico by besting him in battle and having his mother turn Diabolico into a mindless slave. With his new minion in tow, Olympius attacked the Rangers, but his plans were derailed when Diabolico regained his mind and rebelled against Olympius. Although the demon prince was able to destroy Diabolico once again, the Rangers used the opportunity to destroy him in turn. Queen Bansheera revived both Diabolico and Olympius in new \"Super Demon\" forms, allowing them to demolish almost all of the Megazords. Victory seemed at hand until the Rangers brought in their latest and most powerful Megazord: the Life Force Megazord, which killed the two demons once and for all.\n\nImpus was responsible for the creation of a variety of different monsters, most of them either fire-elemental (like Fireor and Trifire) or reptilian (Freezard and Infinitor). Other creatures affiliated with him included Mantevil, Vilevine, and an unhatched Monster Egg (which was predicted to grow into a giant hydra monster). After maturing into Olympius, he proved to be a noteworthy adversary to the Rangers. However, using the Star Power put a great strain on him; he had to gradually get used to his new powers. In his first encounter with the Rangers he swiftly defeated them and managed to capture four of them within the Star Power. Soon after, he used the Star Power to turn himself into nearly identical duplicates of his prisoners and used this power to infiltrate the Aquabase. However, after being weakened from exposure to water, he could no longer contain the Rangers inside the Star Power.\n\nIn battle, Olympius displayed excellent physical strength, stamina, and skills with various weaponry. He primarily used a double-bladed spear, but occasionally used some of the Rangers' own weapons against them, including Carter's Rescue Blaster and the RescueBird. Olympius also has shown the ability of [[pyrokinesis]] by expelling fire and controlling it. He is a skilled warrior, defeating an army of undead demons during his time in the Shadow World and even besting Diabolico twice (destroying him outright the second time). In his more powerful draconic form, he displayed great powers by reflecting the Rangers' weaponry and firing his own energy. However, to maintain his strength in this form he needed an external energy source (for this he drained power from the Aquabase); without a suitable energy source he was considerably hindered. Even so, he managed to survive blows from the Omega Megazord and Lightspeed Solarzord that would have normally destroyed other monsters, weakening enough only to revert him back to his normal form. In his Super Demon form, he was at the peak of his power; by combining his powers with Diabolico, he managed to destroy nearly all of the Rangers' Megazords, a feat that very few villains and monsters have achieved in the series.\n\nOlympius alters his appearance and anatomy over the series, though all his forms have a red color scheme and draconic aspects. His infant form was a mix of a [[Furby]] with a baby dragon. His second (adult) form is a humanoid dragon-like warrior with a white face. After escaping from the Shadow World, Olympius developed more demonic features, including large horns, talons, and tails, a snake-like neck, bestial musculature, and a [[Malebolgia]]-like jaw. His Super Demon form exaggerates his monstrous features in a [[Godzilla]]-like fashion, with a longer, more reptilian snout and the removal of white colors on his face.\n\nImpus is voiced by [[Brianne Siddall]] while his adult form of Olympius is voiced by [[Michael Forest]].\n\n===Diabolico===\nDiabolico (a name based on the word \"diabolical,\" whose root comes from the Spanish for \"devil\") is the primary villain for the first part of the ''Lightspeed Rescue'' series. He is a golden [[devil]]-like [[demon]] with an elongated skull, multiple horns and spikes on his head and shoulders, and a second, monstrous face on his chest. With Queen Bansheera absent and Prince Impus still an infant, Diabolico is the ''de facto'' leader of the demons. In addition to commanding the villains, Diabolico was given the Star Power by Queen Bansheera prior to his imprisonment, indicating that she considered him to be her greatest servant.\n\nSome time before the series, Diabolico appeared before Captain Mitchell and his two children when they were hanging off the edge of a cliff after a car accident. He offered to save Mitchell's son, Ryan, if he could take custody of the boy; unable to let his son fall to his doom, Mitchell reluctantly agreed. After telling Mitchell that Ryan would return on his twentieth birthday, Diabolico saved the boy from his fall and spirited him away for training as a mighty warrior.\n\nDiabolico led the demons' efforts to destroy Mariner Bay and rebuild Queen Bansheera's empire, but the Lightspeed Rangers thwarted him at every turn. After several failures, he sent Ryan - now a bitter young man - to steal the Titanium Morpher from the Aquabase and use its power against the Rangers. Unfortunately for Diabolico, Captain Mitchell was able to redeem his son, who returned the Titanium Morpher and informed Diabolico that he was severing his ties with him.\n\nQueen Bansheera quickly tired of Diabolico's failures, threatening to take his Star Power and give it to her son Impus if her general could not produce results soon. In response, Diabolico summoned his most powerful monsters - Demonite, Falkar, and Thunderon - with orders to spread explosive feathers across Mariner Bay and destroy the Rangers when they tried to interfere. The powerful demons almost succeeded in their task, but Ryan - having accepted his role as a hero - became the Titanium Ranger once again and fended off the monsters. As punishment for Ryan's interference, Diabolico cursed his one-time protege; every time he morphed, a cobra tattoo would move up his back until it reached his neck and killed him.\n\nDespite this advantage, Diabolico's monsters continued to fail against the Lightspeed Rangers. Growing increasingly desperate, Diabolico considered killing Impus himself to prevent him losing his Star Power, but lost the chance when the other demons walked in on him. In a final attempt to destroy the Power Rangers, he personally enlarged himself and engaged them in battle. He had the upper hand until Ryan - now purged of the cobra curse - joined the team, allowing them to form the Lightspeed Solarzord. This new Megazord absorbed one of Diabolico's blasts and used it to power its cannons, bombarding Diabolico until he finally fell in defeat. With his destruction, the Star Power went to Impus, who quickly matured into Olympius.\n\nAs with all defeated monsters, Diabolico's spirit was sent to the Shadow World. However, he was eventually revived by Vypra and Loki to take revenge on Olympius, who used Vilevine to try and destroy them. Diabolico immediately returned to his queen's side, attempting to regain favor with her and recapture the Star Power from Olympius. He managed to trap the demon prince in the Shadow World, but Olympius escaped, vowing vengeance on Diabolico in turn. Diabolico also thwarted the Sorcerer of the Sands' attempt to destroy Skull Cavern, annihilating the ancient wizard in the process.\n\nWhen Queen Bansheera regained her body and sent Loki to eliminate the Rangers, Diabolico overheard her declaring that she was only using Loki to try and destroy all of her foes at once. He immediately came to Loki's aid, only to be sucked into a vortex and dropped outside Skull Cavern with his fellow demon and four of the Lightspeed Rangers. During the resulting battle, Bansheera forced Diabolico to fire on the Rangers before Loki could get out of the way; the Rangers survived, but Loki did not. Infuriated at his queen's callousness, Diabolico contacted Carter (currently trying to free his friends from Skull Cavern) and revealed Bansheera's weak spot. Although Carter took Diabolico's advice and was able to free the victims of the vortex, Bansheera survived, forcing Diabolico to flee.\n\nWhile walking through a forest and fuming over the deaths of Vypra and Loki, Diabolico encountered Olympius, who had been hiding out while recovering from his last battle with the Rangers. The two demons battled fiercely, but Diabolico was defeated in the end. He was dragged back to Queen Bansheera, who turned him into Olympius' mindless pet. The two then attacked the Rangers, but some verbal pushing from Carter reawakened Diabolico's mind. As he battled Olympius, he tried to give Carter the key to the Ancient Tomb, but Olympius killed him moments before he could do so. After the Rangers killed Olympius in turn, Bansheera revived the two of them as giant Super Demons. More powerful than ever and firmly under Bansheera's control, Diabolico wreaked havoc on the city and the Rangers' Megazords alongside Olympius. It took the power of the new Lifeforce Megazord to finally destroy the two Super Demons, after which Diabolico's key flew to the Ancient Tomb and revealed the final plan of Queen Bansheera.\n\nAlthough Diabolico was destroyed, he made one final appearance at the very end of ''The Fate of Lightspeed''. While Queen Bansheera attempted to drag Carter into a portal to the Shadow World, Diabolico's spirit appeared before them and offered his help. To Bansheera's dismay, Diabolico intervened on the Rangers' behalf, severing her tentacles with a blast of energy. As the Rangers pulled Carter out and closed the tomb, Diabolico's laughing spirit forced Queen Bansheera into the Shadow World, leaving her at the mercy of the imprisoned demons.\n\nDiabolico displayed strong spiritual powers, as he was able to appear in a spiritual form even when he was imprisoned and after being destroyed. He displayed some knowledge of magic, as he recognized and countered the spell used by the Sorcerer of the Sands to try and destroy Skull Cavern. One of his odder abilities allowed him to detach his hand and send it to grab distant objects before pulling them back to himself (or sending himself to his hand's location). He could also control the weather and fire energy blasts from his hands and mouths. His weapon of choice was a skull-themed staff with axe-like blades at one end, capable of firing powerful blasts of varying form. With the Star Power, Diabolico was immensely powerful; one of his energy beams was enough to put a hole through the Super Train Megazord. Even without the Star Power, he was a competent fighter, nearly besting Olympius in their first battle.\n\nAfter being brainwashed by Queen Bansheera, Diabolico's eyes become pure black, with small arcs of electricity running across them periodically. In his Super Demon form, Diabolico takes on a more monstrous appearance, sprouting more spikes on his body and lengthening his existing horns. Instead of his staff, he wielded a jewel-encrusted sword as his weapon. His power was at its absolute peak in this form; alongside Olympius, he destroyed nearly all of the Rangers' Megazords, a feat that only the strongest monsters and villains in the ''Power Rangers'' franchise can achieve.\n\nSome subliminal messages suggest that Diabolico is Olympius' father: he was clearly a favorite of Bansheera (presumably an ex-lover), the other demons saw him as a kind of a king consort under their queen, and Olympius was expected to succeed him as the owner of the Star Power.\n\nDiabolico also appears as the sixth and final boss in ''Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue'' for [[Game Boy Color]].\n\nDiabolico is voiced by [[Neil Kaplan]].\n\n===Vypra===\nVypra is one of only two female [[demon]]s, along with Queen Bansheera. She is the most human-looking demon, resembling a young, dark-haired woman wearing serpentine armor and bat-like wings. She is skilled in dark magic. Initially, Vypra was considered a motherly figure to the young Impus, but she began to look down on him as an immature leader after he matured into Olympius.\n\nVypra personally led several attacks on the Rangers over the course of the series. In combat, she primarily used a thin saber that could unleash energy disks. She also piloted the Vyprari, a swift vehicle resembling a modified dune buggy. She almost never took hits, particularly because her armor does not fully cover her torso, but apparently she was vulnerable to damage, because in at least one episode, Carter was able to hold her up by threatening to shoot her.\n\nAfter Olympius lost favor with his mother, he discovered that she was considering making Loki and Vypra second in command. He plotted to eliminate them by having Vilevine bury them alive. Loki and Vypra retaliated by bringing back Diabolico from the dead to deal with him. Having failed in her last attempt to destroy the Rangers, Vypra was absorbed by Queen Bansheera to use her energy to regain a bodily form.\n\nIn the \"Time for Lightspeed\" episode of ''[[Power Rangers Time Force]]'' after Bansheera's defeat, Vypra is seen emerging from a graveyard and returns from the dead with an army of undead soldiers. She teams up with the mutant Ransik to obtain an artifact called the Solar Amulet. With its Dark Magic from the Shadow World and the sun being in perfect alignment with the stars, she used its power to revive the Super Demon Quarganon in Silver Hills. However, she was killed again by [[Wesley Collins]] (Red Time Force Ranger) with his Red Battle Warrior and Quarganon by Carter with his Trans-Armor Cycle. Her resurrection is never explained.\n\nVypra is played by Jennifer L. Yen (episodes 1; 4-37) and Wen Yann Shih (episodes 2-3).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793390/</ref>\n\n===Loki===\nLoki (pronounced \"Low-Kai\") is a fierce and loyal [[Kobold]]-like demon warrior and friend to Diabolico (to whom Loki gave a spider/scorpion-shaped amulet to as a token of their millennia-long friendship) and Vypra. He serves as the dumb muscle of the demons, and was considered expendable by Queen Bansheera despite his loyalty.\n\nThe monsters Loki created were mainly earth-elemental, including Quakemon and Elestomp. In battle, Loki normally used a two-pronged staff as his weapon, but in \"The Wrath of the Queen\", the final episode he appeared in, he used a bazooka that was in the shape of a dragon's head. Loki could also expel electricity from his eyes.\n\nWhen Diabolico was destroyed for the first time, Loki and Vypra were anguished by his death and considered the newly matured Olympius as a mere child who would not make a suitable leader, Loki refuses to take abuse from Olympius. After losing favor with his mother, Olympius discovered that Bansheera considered making Vypra and Loki the new second in command and plotted to eliminate them by having Vilevine bury them alive. The two managed to survive and escape to where the demons were first imprisoned and brought Diabolico back to life to help get rid of Olympius.\n\nAfter regaining her body (at the expense of Vypra's life), Queen Bansheera allowed Loki to personally go after the Rangers, calling him her \"favorite\" servant. In truth, however, Loki was being used in a plan to destroy the Power Rangers when Diabolico tries to warn him; during the resulting battle, Bansheera telepathically took control of Diabolico's body and forced him to use Loki's bazooka to take aim at the Rangers, an act that would also risk harming Loki. The Rangers managed to survive the blast, but he was fatally wounded, Loki should had listen to Diabolico and died in his arms, his body exploding and reduced to ash in the typical way monsters were destroyed. This proved to be the final straw for Diabolico, who began actively working against his queen to avenge the death of his friend.\n\nLoki is voiced by [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]].\n\n===Jinxer===\nJinxer (whose name is based on the term \"jinx\") is a [[fly]]-like demon who served Queen Bansheera and her henchmen. He was highly insightful and skilled in the ways of magic. He specialized in using magic cards for various purposes such as summoning Batlings, creating monsters, and empowering or reviving fallen demons. He was also skilled in use of hypnotism and magical artifacts. He was a cowardly sort of villain, relying on his summoned monsters and Batlings, but he did battle the Rangers at least a few times. His method of attacking was using a cane-like blaster.\n\nHe is extremely loyal to Olympius, supporting him even after the villain was trapped in the Shadow World. In \"''Olympius Unbound''\", Jinxer devises a plan to free the demon prince; disguising himself as hypnotist Mr. Mesmer (played by Benton Jennings), he plants an evil suggestion in Captain Mitchell's subconscious. While Olympius defeats demon spirits in the Shadow World to gain enough power to return to the living world, Jinxer puppeteers Captain Mitchell into placing a Star Power gemstone in the Aquabase's generator, diverting its power to Olympius himself. The Rangers manage to foil Olympius' plot for power, but Jinxer remains loyal, retrieving the prince's body and hiding him in a cave to tend his wounds.\n\nDuring the Rangers' battle against the Super Demon forms of Diabolico and Olympius, Jinxer realized that he was out of monsters and magic spell cards; a single Batling card was all that he had left. With no other ideas, he planted the card on the leg of the Lifeforce Megazord, allowing a massive army of Batlings to invade the Aquabase and commandeer the remaining Megazords. Jinxer himself and a small faction of Batlings piloted the newly repaired Omega Megazord to place a circle of stones around Mariner Bay; their goal was to assist Queen Bansheera in opening the gateway into the Shadow World. After placing the final stone, Carter and Ryan destroyed the Omega Megazord by ramming the Mobile Armor Vehicle into it; Jinxer's final fate is never on screen, but it is assumed he and some Batlings were destroyed as well.\n\nJinxer is voiced by [[Kim Strauss]].\n\n===Troika Demons===\nThe Troika Demons are a trio of [[fallen angel]]-like [[demon]]s that serve as Diabolico's strongest servants. He saved their cards as a last resort against the Power Rangers, only unleashing them when it seemed that Queen Bansheera was planning to transfer his Star Power to Impus if he failed her again.\n\nThe Troika Demons' first attempt to destroy the Rangers involved spreading feathers from their wings across Mariner Bay - when the sun set, the feathers would explode and devastate the city. Fortunately, Lightspeed Rescue was able to retrieve almost all of the feathers (the last one was thrown away by Ryan) before the sun set. With their foes drawn into the open, the three warriors engaged the five Rangers in battle, defeating them with ease. However, they were soundly defeated in turn by Ryan, who had accepted his destiny as the Titanium Ranger.\n\nAfter returning to report their failure, the Troika Demons were sent back into the city to try again. This time, Diabolico provided them with two new advantages over the Rangers; Ryan had been cursed with a cobra tattoo that would eventually destroy him if he morphed too many times, and Demonite had been given a mirror that allowed him to create a clone of himself. With these new tricks up their sleeves, the Troika Demons tried to draw the primary Rangers away from Ryan, leaving Demonite's clone to attack the weakened Titanium Ranger. However, the clone was destroyed along with his template, with Ryan risking his life to use the Max Solarzord against Demonite's giant form.\n\nDespite the loss of their leader, Falkar and Thunderon were quickly redeployed against the Rangers, still proving to be a match for them. It was only after the Rangers managed to separate the demons that they finally overcame them, even after Falkar and Thunderon were supersized by Diabolico.\n\nFitting their ranks as Diabolico's greatest minions, the Troika Demons lasted a fairly long time against the Rangers; the fight against them made up a four-episode arc in the series (from \"Ryan's Destiny\" to \"The Cobra Strikes\"). Their members include:\n\n====Demonite====\nDemonite is a demonic [[knight]]-like warrior and the leader of the trio. In battle, he used the [[sword]] [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]] on his right hand, which was sharp enough to slice a car in two. He could also fire lasers from his eyes and left hand. He was eventually lured into a trap by the Rangers, leaving him facing a pair of guns wielded by Carter. The Red Ranger is reluctant to shoot - largely because he would risk destroying himself - but Demonite's attempt to attack forces him to fire. Although Demonite is destroyed in the blast, Jinxer revives him as a giant, more monstrous version where he no longer wears a helmet and wields two swords. Demonite's advanced form is destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. His gem is red, with the image of a sword inside of it.\n\nDemonite is voiced by [[David Stenstrom]].\n\n====Thunderon====\nThunderon is a hulking, green-skinned [[Vikings|viking]]/[[ghoul]]-like demon with small angel wings on his back. He attacked with his brute strength, which proved great enough to actually juggle the Rangers in the air if he got a hold of them. His gauntlets were equipped with spiked knuckles to increase his punching power, and he could shoot green electricity from his eyes. He seemingly managed to defeat the Rangers, but they were faking defeat in order to blast him at close range with their V-Lancers. Thunderon was destroyed by a second combined blast, but Diabolico revived him as a giant. Unlike his comrades, his appearance did not change in the process. Despite getting backup from a reluctant Falkar, Thunderon is destroyed the Max Solarzord. His gem is green and bears an image of one of his fists.\n\nThunderon is voiced by [[Alonzo Bodden]].\n\n====Falkar====\nFalkar is an [[elf]]/[[falcon]]-themed warrior. He behaved in an effeminate manner and used a three-pronged staff, which he could use to stab opponents or as a base for a high-speed spinning attack. He could also fire blue energy beams from the eyes of his falcon-helmet. While battling the Rangers alongside Thunderon, Falkar is lured into an old building by the Pink and Yellow Rangers and buried under rubble. By the time Falkar dug himself out, the Rangers had engaged a giant Thunderon with their Megazord. Although Falkar attempts to stay on the sidelines, Diabolico finds him and advises that he joins the fight. Falkar states that he'd like to see how Thunderon does first. Diabolico insists anyway and uses an Advanced Growth Card on Falkar to force his cowardly minion into the fight. The card merged Falkar with his armor, transforming him into a more draconic-like form where he gains super-strength and can perform a spinning kick with the help of his transformed staff. Falkar is destroyed by the Max Solarzord. His gem is brown and bears an image of one of his wings.\n\nFalkar is voiced by [[Ezra Weisz]].\n\n====Troika====\nAfter each Troika demon was destroyed, their bodies transformed into a colored gem that returned to Diabolico's possession. Using these gems, Diabolico revives his minions and fuses them into Troika, a powerful chimeric warrior with white feathers/fur covering most of his body. The faces of his component demons are all present on different sides of his head with Demonite's face in the center, Thunderon's face on the left side of his head, and Falkar's face on the right side of his head. His body includes Demonite's right arm, Thunderon's left arm, and Falkar's feet, the chest is black and bears all three of the Troika Demons' gems over a white visage resembling a screaming ghost. Troika combines the best abilities of his components giving him incredible Thunderon's strength, Demonite's skill, and Falkar's speed. His main attacks include firing energy blasts from his sword arm and moving at high speeds while spinning like a top.\n\nThe Rangers had a hard time fighting Troika. Luckily for the Rangers, Miss Fairweather is able to provide them with the Battle Boosters in their next battle, allowing them to overcome Troika.\n\nTroika speaks with the voices of Demonite, Thunderon, and Falkar in unison.\n\n===Triskull===\nTriskull is a [[demon]] warrior who swears allegiance to Trakeena. He is the leader of the [[Ghoul]]s, foot soldiers Trakeena uses with the destruction of her Sting Wingers. He pretends to aid Olympius in collecting energy for Queen Bansheera, but is actually collecting it so Trakeena can return to her insectoid form. He attempts to stop the Rangers from entering the building where the energy is kept and is destroyed by the Red Galaxy and Lightspeed Rangers.\n\nTriskull's power is highly inconsistent since in the episode before his death, he easily defeated all Galaxy and Lightspeed Rangers.\n\nUnlike most villains and monsters, Triskull did not explode after being killed by the Rangers. This is due to his ''Super Sentai'' counterpart not doing so.\n\nTriskull is voiced by [[Michael Sorich]].\n\n===Batlings===\nThe Batlings are [[bat]]-like foot soldiers who are summoned from Jinxer's cards to act as the bulk of their forces. They resemble MMPR's Putty Patrollers, but have black outfits, large goggles on their eyes, and small bat wings on their helmets and backs. They use small swords in combat, and occasionally display the ability to transform into bats for ambushes.\n\n===Demons===\nThe following monsters are conjured by Diabolico and his forces through Demon Cards. To make a demon grow, Jinxer would throw a magic card into their body (or their shattered remains) and cast an incantation, transforming the demon's body into a cloud of bats that coalesce into a larger form. If an Advanced Growth card is used, the demon can manifest in an even stronger form. Queen Bansheera displayed the ability to empower monsters in a similar fashion by planting her tentacles in their bodies. She can also seal their minds away to transform them into obedient servants. When a demon is destroyed, its spirit is sent to the Shadow World where the demons becomes a largely mindless husk of its former self only concerned with destroying everything it sees (a trait made more threatening by the fact that it cannot be killed with it being already dead).\n\n* '''Ghouligan''' (voiced by [[Ken Merckx]]) - A [[fire]]-based demon. After Carter got a glimpse of him during his firefighting job, Ghouligan and the Batlings attacked Mariner Bay. This monster was destroyed by the Rangers' Rescue Blasters.{{efn|Ghouligan is a partially-recolored version of Psycho Red's monster form.}}\n* '''Magmavore''' (voiced by [[Kim Strauss]] in the first appearance]], [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] in the second appearance) - A giant [[lava]] [[golem]] that appeared from a meteor that crashed into Mariner Bay summoned by Jinxer.

Smogger hurls explosive orbs at buildings that causes them to be set on fire. This monster was destroyed by the Red Ranger's Lightspeed Cycle and Rescue Speeder.\n* '''Trifire''' (voiced by [[Dave Mallow]]) - A fire-breathing three-headed [[dragon]] demon created by Impus to cause Mt. Jasmine to erupt. This monster was destroyed by the Lightspeed Megazord. Trifire was later resurrected by Queen Bansheera in a stronger [[dragon]]-like form where it wields a sword, gains stronger armor, and can shoot lightning out of his three heads. This monster was destroyed again by the Supertrain Megazord.\n* '''Liztwin''' (voiced by [[Archie Kao]]) - A skeletal [[dinosaur]]/[[dragon]]-like demon with a dragon head for a right hand that was unleashed by Vypra to distract the Rangers while Ryan escaped. His advanced form has larger horns, two extra small horns, two back sails in place of his back spikes, a large right hand with long claws on it in place of the dragon head. This monster was destroyed by the Supertrain Megazord.\n* '''Demonite Clone''' (voiced by [[David Stenstrom]]) - After the Troika Monsters were defeated in battle against the Titanium Ranger, Diabolico gave the apologetic Demonite a special Mirror Card to aid the him and his fellow monsters in the battle against the Rangers. When Demonite used the Mirror Card, it created a clone of himself. This clone almost exactly resembles the original Demonite except the clone possessed two sword gauntlets instead of one and also had a blue-visor.\n* '''Cobra Monster''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) - A [[cobra]] demon with cobra-headed hands that was associated with the Cobra Tattoo that Diabolico placed on Ryan's back. Once the Cobra Monster was destroyed by Ryan, the Cobra Tattoo on him disappeared.{{efn|The Cobra Monster is a recolored, altered, and mummified version of Snizard.}}\n* '''Thunderclaw''' (voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]]) - A [[stag beetle]] demon that aided Vypra in a failed attempt to infiltrate the Lightspeed Aquabase.

Her advanced form appeared as a defeated demon in the Shadow World that was summoned by Gatekeeper.\n* '''Aquafiend''' (voiced by [[Peter Greenwood]]) - A [[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]] demon summoned by Diabolico. According to Diabolico, Aquafiend was the only demon monster that was not affected by water like the other demons were. In fact, Aquafiend lived in the waters of a lagoon near Mariner Bay.

It was established in 17 AD by the Emperor [[Tiberius]] (ruled 14-37 AD), following the death of [[Cappadocia]]'s last king, [[Archelaus of Cappadocia|Archelaus]].\n\nCappadocia was an [[imperial province]], meaning that its governor (''[[legatus]] [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]'') was directly appointed by the emperor. During the latter 1st century, the province also incorporated the regions of [[Bithynia and Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Armenia Minor]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Asia minor roman power.jpg|350px|thumb|The expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] in [[Asia Minor]] from 188 BC until 63 BC.]]\n\n===Roman ally===\nPrior to direct imperial rule, Cappadocia was one of the successor kingdoms of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. The Kingdom of Cappadocia was ruled by the [[Ariarathes I of Cappadocia|Ariarathid dynasty]] from 331 BC until 95 BC. Under [[Ariarathes IV]], Cappadocia first came into contact with the [[Roman Republic]] as a foe allied to the[[Seleucid Empire|Selecuid King]] [[Antiochus the Great]] during the [[Roman\u2013Seleucid War]] from 192\u2013188 BC.\n\nFollowing Rome's victory over Antiochus, Ariarathes IV entered friendly relations with the Republic by betrothing his daughter to the king of [[Pergamum]], a Roman ally. The Ariarathid kings would thereafter become a major ally of Rome in the East. The kingdom supported the Republic as a counterweight against the [[Seleucid Empire]], which claimed dominion over the Cappadocian kingdom. Cappadocia would also support Rome in the [[Third Macedonian War]] against [[Perseus of Macedon]] from 171\u2013166 BC. Rome's defeat of the Selecuids and Macedonia established the Republic as a major power in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nWhen King [[Attalus III]] (138\u2013133 BC) died without an heir in 133 BC, he bequeathed the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] to Rome. [[Eumenes III]] claimed the Pergamon throne, occupying the territory. In 130 BC, Cappadocian king [[Ariarathes V]] supported the [[Roman Consul]] [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus]] in his failed attempt to overthrow Eumenes III. Both Crassus and Ariarathes V fell in battle against Eumenes III. Ariarathes V's death resulted in his minor son, [[Ariarathes VI]], occupying the Cappadocian throne.\n\nKing [[Mithridates V of Pontus]] exerted control over Cappadocia by betrothing his daughter [[Laodice of Cappadocia|Laodice]] to Ariarathes VI. Mithridates V would later launch a military invasion of Cappadocia, forming the kingdom into a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. Though nominally independent, Pontic influence over Cappadocia was continued by his son [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]].\n\nIn 116 BC, the Cappadocian king Ariarathes VI was murdered by the Cappadocian noble [[Gordius of Cappadocia|Gordius]] on orders from Mithridates VI. Mithridates VI then installed his sister Laodice, Ariarathes VI's widow, as regent over for the infant [[Ariarathes VII]], further solidifying Pontic control over the kingdom. After King [[Nicomedes III of Bithynia]] married Laodice, he tried to annex Cappadocia into his kingdom and deposed Ariarathes VII. Mithridates VI swiftly invaded, expelling Nicomedes III from the region, restoring his nephew Ariarathes VII to the Cappadocian throne, and returning Cappadocia to Pontus' [[sphere of influence]].\n\nThe Pontic king would later have Ariarathes VII murdered in 101 BC, with Mirthridates VI installing his eight-year-old son [[Ariarathes IX]] on the Cappadocian throne as his puppet king. As a child, Ariarathes IX was unable to maintain control of the kingdom, with the Cappadocian nobles rebelling against his rule in 97 BC and naming [[Ariarathes VIII]], son of the murdered Ariarathes VII, as king. Mithridates quickly put down the rebellion, exiled Arirarathes VIII, and restored his son to the Cappadocian throne.\n\n===Roman client kingdom (95 BC-14 AD) ===\n\nIn response to the turmoil in Cappadocia, in 95 BC king [[Nicomedes III of Bithynia]] sent an embassy to Rome, claiming dominion over the kingdom. [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] likewise sent an embassy to Rome, seeking Roman approval of his dominion over Cappadocia. The [[Roman Senate]], however, did not assign the kingdom to either.\n\nInstead, the Senate demanded both Pontus and Bithynia withdraw from Cappadocia and guarantee its independence. The Senate ordered Ariarathes IX deposed. With military support from the [[Roman governor]] of [[Cilicia]] [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]], [[Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia|Ariobarzanes I]] was installed as king of Cappadocia. With Ariobarzanes I installed on the throne in 95 BC, Cappadocia became a [[client kingdom]] under the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nIn 93 BC, troops from the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under [[Tigranes the Great]], son-in-law of Mithridates VI, invaded Cappadocia at the behest of the Pontic king. Tigranes dethroned Ariobarzanes I, who fled to Rome, and crowned [[Gordius of Cappadocia|Gordius]] as the new client-king of Cappadocia. With Cappadocia as a [[client kingdom]] under Armenia, Tigranes created a buffer zone between his kingdom and the expanding Roman Republic.\n\nWith Cappadocia secured, Mithridates invaded the [[Bithynia|Kingdom of Bithynia]], defeating king [[Nicomedes IV]] in 90 BC. Nicomedes IV was forced to flee to Italy. A Senatorial delegation was sent east to restore both Nicomedes IV and Ariobarzanes I to their respective kingdoms. Though the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] was still raging in Italy, Rome was able to successfully restore both kings due to the Republic's growing influence in the region.\n\n====Mithridatic Wars (88-63 BC)====\n{{Further|Mithridatic Wars}}\n\n[[File:1stMithritadicwar89BC.svg|450px|thumb|A map of Asia Minor in 89 BC at the start of the [[First Mithridatic War]]. Cappadocia, light green, is shown as a client kingdom of Pontus, dark green.]]\n\nIn 89 BC, after having made peace arrangement with Rome and with Ariobarzanes I restored to the Cappadocian throne, Mithridates VI again invaded Cappadocia, reinstalling his son Ariarathes IX as puppet-king under Pontic rule. Mithridates' actions in Cappadocia sparked the [[First Mithridatic War]] (89-85 BC) between Rome and Pontus and its ally Armenia.\n\n[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] assumed command of the Roman war effort in 87 BC and soundly defeated Mithridates VI and his allies in 85 BC. His attention needed in Rome due to rising political challenges, Sulla imposed mild terms on Mithridates VI: Mithridates was to relinquish his control over Bithynia and Cappadocia, reinstating Ariobarzanes I and Nicomedies IV as Roman client-kings. In return, Rome allowed Mithridates VI to retain his rule over Pontus.\n\nWhen Nicomedes IV died in 74 BC, he bequeathed the [[Bithynia|Kingdom of Bithynia]] to the [[Roman Republic]]. His death caused a [[power vacuum]] in Asia Minor, allowing Mithridates VI to invade and conquer the leaderless kingdom. With Mirthidates VI again having designs on Roman protectorates in Asia Minor, including Cappadocia, Rome launched the [[Third Mithridatic War]] to end the Pontic threat. Dispatching Consul [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] to Asia, Rome drove Pontus and its ally Armenia out of Asia proper, reasserting Roman dominance over the Asian client kingdoms by 71 BC and conquering Pontus in the process. When Mithridates VI fled to Armenia, Lucullus invaded the kingdom in 69 BC.\n\nDespite initial successes, Lucullus was unable to decisively end the war. By 66 BC, Mithridates VI and Tigranes were able to retake their respective kingdoms and Lucullus was recalled to Rome. The Senate then sent [[Pompey the Great]] to the East in order to bring the war to a close. Upon his defeat by Pompey, Mithridates VI again fled to Armenia. Tigranes, however, refused to receive him. Mithridates VI was then forced to flee north across the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] under the rule of his son [[Machares]], bringing the war to an effective end in 65 BC.\n\nWhen Machares refused to launch a new war against Rome, Mithridates VI had him killed and assumed the Bosporan throne for himself. While Mithridates VI was eager to fight the Romans once more, his youngest son [[Pharnaces II of Pontus]] was not and plotted to remove his father from power. His plans were discovered, but the army, not wishing to engage Pompey and his armies, supported Pharnaces. They marched on Mithridates VI and forced their former king to take his own life in 63 BC. Pharnaces II quickly sent an embassy to Pompey with offers of submission. Pompey accepted Pharnaces II's submission and, in returned, named Pharnaces II as the Roman client king of the Bosporan Kingdom.\n\nWith Mithridates VI absent from Asia Minor, Pompey officially annexed Bithynia, Pontus, and Cilicia in the Roman Republic as provinces. Invading Armenia in 64 BC, Tigranes surrendered to Pompey and become a [[client kingdom]] of Rome. With Armenia reduced, Pompey then traveled south and officially annexed the Roman client kingdom of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] in the Republic as a province by deposing its king [[Antiochus XIII Asiaticus]]. Following the death of Ariobarzanes I, Pompey, as one of his final acts in the East before returning to Rome, installed his son [[Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia|Ariobarzanes II]] as the new Roman client king of Cappadocia.\n\nAriobarzanes II reigned as Rome's client king until 51 BC when he was assassinated by forces loyal to the neighboring [[Parthian Empire]]. The [[Roman Senate]] declared his son [[Ariobarzanes III]] as his rightful successor and, with military backing from the [[Roman governor]] of [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]] [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], installed him upon the Cappadocian throne. In 50 BC, Ariobarzanes III, aided by Cicero, discovered a plot by [[Athenais Philostorgos II]], Ariobarzanes III's mother, to depose him and install his younger brother [[Ariarathes X of Cappadocia|Ariarathes X]] as king. Together, Cicero and Ariobarzanes III banished Athenais, who was a daughter of [[Mithridates VI]], from Cappadocia.\n\n====Roman civil wars====\n{{Further|Crisis of the Roman Republic}}\n\nCappadocia became an important player during the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic|Roman Republican civil wars]]. When [[Julius Caesar]] crossed the Rubicon River in 49 BC and started [[Caesar's civil war|his civil war]], many members of the Roman Senate under the leadership of Pompey fled to the East. Cappadocian King [[Ariobarzanes III]] initially supported Pompey against Caesar, thankful for Pompey's support of his father years earlier. However, following Caesar's victory over Pompey at the [[Battle of Pharsulus]] and Pompey's subsequent assassination in 48 BC, Ariobarzanes III declared his loyalty to Caesar. Caesar subsequently named [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus]] as [[Roman governor]] of [[Roman Asia|Asia]] to act as his chief lieutenant in Asia Minor while he traveled to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\nWith the Romans were distracted by civil war, [[Pharnaces II]], the Roman client king of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] and the youngest son of [[Mithridates VI]], decided to seize the opportunity and conquered [[Roman Georgia|Colchis]] and [[Lesser Armenia]] (territories of the Roman province of [[Roman Pontus|Pontus]]). The rulers of Cappadocia and [[Galatia]], Ariobarzanes III and [[Deiotarus]] respectively, appealed to Calvinus for protection and soon the Roman forces sought battle with Pharnaces II. They met at the [[Battle of Nicopolis (48 BC)|Battle of Nicopolis]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], where Pharnaces II defeated the Roman army and overran much of Cappadocia, Pontus, and [[Roman Bithynia|Bithynia]].\n\nAfter the defeating the Ptolemaic forces at the [[Battle of the Nile]], Caesar left Egypt in 47 BC and travelled through Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia to face Pharnaces II. As Pharnaces II gained word of Caesar's approach with his veteran army, he sent envoys to seek a peace, which Caesar refused. Caesar met Pharnaces II at the [[Battle of Zela]], decisively defeating the Pontic king and reassessing Roman dominance over Asia Minor. Upon his return to the Bosporan Kingdom, Pharnaces II was assassinated by his son-in-law [[Asander (Bosporan king)|Asander]]. In return, Caesar named Asander as the kingdom's new Roman client king. Caesar then incorporated Lesser Armenia into Cappadocia to serve as a buffer from Rome's interests in Asia Minor against future Eastern aggression.\n\nCaesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 BC, by the members of the Roman Senate, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] chief among them. The \"Liberators\" then fled from Italy, assuming command of the Republic's eastern provinces and the eastern client kingdoms, including Cappadocia, in 43 BC. When Ariobarzanes III objected to the level of Roman intervention into his kingdom, Cassius had him executed and installed his younger brother [[Ariarathes X of Cappadocia|Ariarathes X]] upon the Cappadocian throne in 42 BC. Later that year, following the defeat of Brutus and Cassius by the [[Second Triumvirate]] at the [[Battle of Philippi]], Triumvir [[Mark Antony]] assumed command of the Eastern provinces and client kingdoms. In 36 BC, Antony executed Ariarathes X and installed [[Archelaus of Cappadocia|Archelaus]] as the new Cappadocian client king.\n\nThe Second Triumvirate expired in 33 BC, ending Antony's legal right to govern the Eastern half of the Republic. With the Triumvirate lapsed, the struggle for dominance between Antony and [[Octavian]] intensified. As Octavian built up his support in the West, Antony drew ever closer to Egyptian Queen [[Cleopatra]]. When [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Octavian declared war on Egypt]], Antony, supported by the Eastern client kingdoms (including Cappadocia), went to Egypt's aid against Octavian. Octavian's victory over Antony at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC ensured Octavian's position as undisputed master of the Roman world. Traveling through Asia Minor and the [[Levant]] from Greece to Egypt, Cappadocian king Archelaus and the other Eastern client kings declared their loyal to Octavian. In return, Octavian allowed him and the other client kings to remain on their thrones.\n\nWhen Octavian became \"Augustus\" as the first [[Roman Emperor]] in 27 BC, Cappadocia become an important and trusted Eastern client kingdom, maintaining its tributary independence under the reorganized [[Roman Empire]]. Archelaus became an important client king for Augustus' Eastern policy. Augustus considered Archelaus as a loyal ruler, making no commitment to convert Cappadocia into a direct province. As a reward for his loyalty, in 25 BC, Augustus assigned to Archelaus the territories of [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]] along the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Lesser Armenia]] along the [[Black Sea]]. Augustus gave Archelaus these additional territories in order to eliminate [[piracy]] in the Eastern Mediterranean and to build a buffer between Rome and the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\n===Roman province===\n\n====During the Principate====\nCappadocia remained an important and trusted eastern client kingdom under [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]]' reign. Rome's policy towards Cappadocia changed, however, following Augustus' death in 14 AD and the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Years earlier, Tiberius had been slighted by Archelaus when the Cappadocian king showed favor to [[Gaius Caesar]], one of Augustus' grandsons and chief heirs. While Tiberius was in retirement on the Greek island of [[Rhodes]] from 6 BC to 2 AD, though the nominal commander of the Eastern half of the Empire, in 1 BC Archelaus recognized Gaius Caesar, then a military commander subordinate to Tiberius, as Augustus' true representative. Though Gaius Caesar was Augustus' preferred successor, his death in 4 AD while on military campaign in Armenia forced Augustus to adopt Tiberius and name him as his successor.\n\nAssuming the Imperial throne in 14 AD, Tiberius set about a change in Rome's eastern policy. Wanting direct access to Cappadocia's resources and seeking to reduce Archelaus, Tiberius summoned Archelaus to Rome in 17 AD. At the time, Archelaus had governed Cappadocia as Rome's client king for over fifty-years. When he arrived in Rome, Tiberius accused Archelaus of harboring revolutionary schemes and imprisoned him, where he died of natural causes soon thereafter.\n\nSending his adoptive son [[Germanicus]] to oversee Rome's affairs in the East, Tiberius then annexed Cappadocia directly into the Empire by reducing the kingdom into a [[Roman province]]. Tiberius awarded rule of the Roman client [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|kingdom of Armenia]] to Archelaus' step-son [[Artaxias III]] and rule of the Roman client [[Roman Cilicia|kingdom of Cilicia]] to Archelaus' son [[Archelaus of Cilicia|Archelaus II]]. Arriving in the East in 18 AD, Germanicus solidified Roman control over Cappadocia and the region. Under orders from the Emperor, Germanicus also annexing Cappadocia's southeastern neighbor, the client [[Kingdom of Commagene]], into the Empire as a part of the province of [[Roman Syria|Syria]].\n\nFor much the 1st century AD, [[Polemon II of Pontus]] ruled as a Roman client king over the remnants of the former kingdom of Pontus ([[Lesser Armenia]] and [[Roman Georgia|Colchis]]). However, in 62 AD, the Roman Emperor [[Nero]] deposed him and annexed his kingdom into direct imperial ruled by incorporating his former territory into Cappadocia.\n\nBording the [[Euphrates]] river to the east, Cappadocia was the most eastern province of the Empire. Its capital, '''Caesarea''' (modern [[Kayseri]]), was located in more central [[Anatolia]], further back from the Parthian frontier. Upon annexation, the province was governed by a [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Roman equestrian order|Equestrian rank]] with the title ''[[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator]]''. The Procutors commanded only [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary military units]] and looked to the [[Roman Senate|Senatorial]] ranked [[Legatus Augusti pro praetore|Imperial Legate]] of Syria for direction.\n\nFollowing the [[Year of the Four Emperors|Roman civil war of 69]], the Emperor [[Vespasian]] upgraded the province to Senatorial rank, making its governor equal in rank with that of Syria. As a Senatorial province during the middle of the second century AD, Cappadocia retained a permanent military garrison of three [[Roman legion|legions]] and several [[Roman auxiliaries|auxiliary]] units, totally over 28,000 troops. The military presence in Cappadocia served as an important response force against invasions from the [[Parthian Empire]] and allowed the Roman's easy intervention into the affairs of their client kingdom of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]].\n\nThe first Cappadocian to be admitted to the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Roman Senate]] was [[Tiberius Claudius Gordianus]], during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] during the middle second century AD.<ref>Walter Eck, \"Emperor, Senate and Magistrates,\" in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70\u2013192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 219.</ref>\n\n====During the Dominate====\nFollowing the provincial reorganization of [[Diocletian]], the Pontic and Armenian territories were split off, and the province was reduced to the region of Cappadocia proper. It was headed by a ''[[consularis]]'' and came under the [[Diocese of Pontus]]. The province was the site of a great number of imperial estates, as contemporary legislation testifies. On the highway between Constantinople and Antioch Caesarea saw a significant number of imperial visits ([[Itineraries of the Roman emperors, 337-361]]); Valens (363-378) was particularly frequent. The future emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] spent his early years at a remote estate, Macellum. Class divisions between the landowning class and the urban and rural poor were extreme, as was also the climate of this upland plateau.\n\nIn the late 330s, the eastern half of the province was split off to form the provinces of [[Roman Armenia|Armenia Prima]] and [[Roman Armenia|Armenia Secunda]]. In 371, emperor [[Valens]] split off the south-western region around [[Tyana]], which became '''Cappadocia Secunda''' under a ''[[praeses]]'', while the remainder became '''Cappadocia Prima''', still under a ''consularis''.\n\nCappadocia during this period saw a generation of Christian thinkers, the most prominent of whom were [[Basil of Caesarea]], his close friend [[Gregory of Nazianzos]], his younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and a cousin of the former, [[Amphilochios of Iconium]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\nIn the period 535-553, under emperor [[Justinian I]], the two provinces were rejoined into a single unit under a ''[[proconsul]]''. Throughout late Roman times, the region was subject to raids by the [[Isaurians]], leading to the fortification of local cities. In the early 7th century, the region was briefly captured by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Following the eruption of the [[Muslim conquests]], repeated raids devastated the region, which became a frontier zone under the new [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ''[[themata]]'' of [[Anatolikon]] and [[Armeniakon]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Roman governors of Cappadocia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n 2.Raymond Van Dam, Kingdom of Snow, University of Pennsylvania Press, \n\n{{Roman provinces AD 117}}\n{{Late Roman Provinces}}\n\n{{coord|38.6706|N|34.8392|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Provinces of the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 10s]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in the 7th century]]\n[[Category:Roman Pontus]]\n[[Category:Roman Cappadocia| ]]\n[[Category:10s establishments in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:7th-century disestablishments in the Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:1st-century establishments]]\n[[Category:7th-century disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox Former Subdivision\n|native_name               = {{aut|Provincia Cappadocia}}<br>{{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 \u039a\u03b1\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}\n|conventional_long_name    = \n|common_name               = Cappadocia\n|subdivision               = [[Roman province|Province]]\n|nation                    = the [[Roman Empire]]\n|era                       = [[ancient history|Antiquity]]\n|capital                   = [[Kayseri|Caesarea]]\n|title_leader              = \n|image_map                 = Roman Empire - Cappadocia (125 AD).svg\n|image_map_caption         = The Roman empire in the time of [[Hadrian]] (117\u2013138 AD), with the [[imperial province]] of Cappadocia highlighted.\n|life_span                 =\n|year_start                = 18 AD\n|event_start               = Annexed by [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]]\n|year_end                  = 7th Century\n|event_end                 = Byzantine reorganization\n|today                     = {{flag|Turkey}}\n|p1                        = Kingdom of Cappadocia\n|s1                        = Armeniac Theme\n}}\n\n'''Cappadocia''' was a [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] (modern central-eastern [[Turkey]]), with its capital at [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]. It was established in 17 AD by the Emperor [[Tiberius]] (ruled 14-37 AD), following the death of [[Cappadocia]]'s last king, [[Archelaus of Cappadocia|Archelaus]].\n\nCappadocia was an [[imperial province]], meaning that its governor (''[[legatus]] [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]'') was directly appointed by the emperor. During the latter 1st century, the province also incorporated the regions of [[Bithynia and Pontus|Pontus]] and [[Armenia Minor]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Asia minor roman power.jpg|350px|thumb|The expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] in [[Asia Minor]] from 188 BC until 63 BC.]]\n\n===Roman ally===\nPrior to direct imperial rule, Cappadocia was one of the successor kingdoms of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. The Kingdom of Cappadocia was ruled by the [[Ariarathes I of Cappadocia|Ariarathid dynasty]] from 331 BC until 95 BC. Under [[Ariarathes IV]], Cappadocia first came into contact with the [[Roman Republic]] as a foe allied to the[[Seleucid Empire|Selecuid King]] [[Antiochus the Great]] during the [[Roman\u2013Seleucid War]] from 192\u2013188 BC.\n\nFollowing Rome's victory over Antiochus, Ariarathes IV entered friendly relations with the Republic by betrothing his daughter to the king of [[Pergamum]], a Roman ally. The Ariarathid kings would thereafter become a major ally of Rome in the East. The kingdom supported the Republic as a counterweight against the [[Seleucid Empire]], which claimed dominion over the Cappadocian kingdom. Cappadocia would also support Rome in the [[Third Macedonian War]] against [[Perseus of Macedon]] from 171\u2013166 BC. Rome's defeat of the Selecuids and Macedonia established the Republic as a major power in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nWhen King [[Attalus III]] (138\u2013133 BC) died without an heir in 133 BC, he bequeathed the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] to Rome. [[Eumenes III]] claimed the Pergamon throne, occupying the territory. In 130 BC, Cappadocian king [[Ariarathes V]] supported the [[Roman Consul]] [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus]] in his failed attempt to overthrow Eumenes III. Both Crassus and Ariarathes V fell in battle against Eumenes III. Ariarathes V's death resulted in his minor son, [[Ariarathes VI]], occupying the Cappadocian throne.\n\nKing [[Mithridates V of Pontus]] exerted control over Cappadocia by betrothing his daughter [[Laodice of Cappadocia|Laodice]] to Ariarathes VI. Mithridates V would later launch a military invasion of Cappadocia, forming the kingdom into a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. Though nominally independent, Pontic influence over Cappadocia was continued by his son [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]].\n\nIn 116 BC, the Cappadocian king Ariarathes VI was murdered by the Cappadocian noble [[Gordius of Cappadocia|Gordius]] on orders from Mithridates VI. Mithridates VI then installed his sister Laodice, Ariarathes VI's widow, as regent over for the infant [[Ariarathes VII]], further solidifying Pontic control over the kingdom.

The [[Roman Senate]] declared his son [[Ariobarzanes III]] as his rightful successor and, with military backing from the [[Roman governor]] of [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]] [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], installed him upon the Cappadocian throne. In 50 BC, Ariobarzanes III, aided by Cicero, discovered a plot by [[Athenais Philostorgos II]], Ariobarzanes III's mother, to depose him and install his younger brother [[Ariarathes X of Cappadocia|Ariarathes X]] as king. Together, Cicero and Ariobarzanes III banished Athenais, who was a daughter of [[Mithridates VI]], from Cappadocia.\n\n====Roman civil wars====\n{{Further|Crisis of the Roman Republic}}\n\nCappadocia became an important player during the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic|Roman Republican civil wars]]. When [[Julius Caesar]] crossed the Rubicon River in 49 BC and started [[Caesar's civil war|his civil war]], many members of the Roman Senate under the leadership of Pompey fled to the East. Cappadocian King [[Ariobarzanes III]] initially supported Pompey against Caesar, thankful for Pompey's support of his father years earlier. However, following Caesar's victory over Pompey at the [[Battle of Pharsulus]] and Pompey's subsequent assassination in 48 BC, Ariobarzanes III declared his loyalty to Caesar. Caesar subsequently named [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus]] as [[Roman governor]] of [[Roman Asia|Asia]] to act as his chief lieutenant in Asia Minor while he traveled to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\nWith the Romans were distracted by civil war, [[Pharnaces II]], the Roman client king of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]] and the youngest son of [[Mithridates VI]], decided to seize the opportunity and conquered [[Roman Georgia|Colchis]] and [[Lesser Armenia]] (territories of the Roman province of [[Roman Pontus|Pontus]]). The rulers of Cappadocia and [[Galatia]], Ariobarzanes III and [[Deiotarus]] respectively, appealed to Calvinus for protection and soon the Roman forces sought battle with Pharnaces II. They met at the [[Battle of Nicopolis (48 BC)|Battle of Nicopolis]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], where Pharnaces II defeated the Roman army and overran much of Cappadocia, Pontus, and [[Roman Bithynia|Bithynia]].\n\nAfter the defeating the Ptolemaic forces at the [[Battle of the Nile]], Caesar left Egypt in 47 BC and travelled through Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia to face Pharnaces II. As Pharnaces II gained word of Caesar's approach with his veteran army, he sent envoys to seek a peace, which Caesar refused. Caesar met Pharnaces II at the [[Battle of Zela]], decisively defeating the Pontic king and reassessing Roman dominance over Asia Minor. Upon his return to the Bosporan Kingdom, Pharnaces II was assassinated by his son-in-law [[Asander (Bosporan king)|Asander]]. In return, Caesar named Asander as the kingdom's new Roman client king. Caesar then incorporated Lesser Armenia into Cappadocia to serve as a buffer from Rome's interests in Asia Minor against future Eastern aggression.\n\nCaesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 BC, by the members of the Roman Senate, [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] chief among them. The \"Liberators\" then fled from Italy, assuming command of the Republic's eastern provinces and the eastern client kingdoms, including Cappadocia, in 43 BC. When Ariobarzanes III objected to the level of Roman intervention into his kingdom, Cassius had him executed and installed his younger brother [[Ariarathes X of Cappadocia|Ariarathes X]] upon the Cappadocian throne in 42 BC. Later that year, following the defeat of Brutus and Cassius by the [[Second Triumvirate]] at the [[Battle of Philippi]], Triumvir [[Mark Antony]] assumed command of the Eastern provinces and client kingdoms. In 36 BC, Antony executed Ariarathes X and installed [[Archelaus of Cappadocia|Archelaus]] as the new Cappadocian client king.\n\nThe Second Triumvirate expired in 33 BC, ending Antony's legal right to govern the Eastern half of the Republic. With the Triumvirate lapsed, the struggle for dominance between Antony and [[Octavian]] intensified. As Octavian built up his support in the West, Antony drew ever closer to Egyptian Queen [[Cleopatra]]. When [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Octavian declared war on Egypt]], Antony, supported by the Eastern client kingdoms (including Cappadocia), went to Egypt's aid against Octavian. Octavian's victory over Antony at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC ensured Octavian's position as undisputed master of the Roman world. Traveling through Asia Minor and the [[Levant]] from Greece to Egypt, Cappadocian king Archelaus and the other Eastern client kings declared their loyal to Octavian. In return, Octavian allowed him and the other client kings to remain on their thrones.\n\nWhen Octavian became \"Augustus\" as the first [[Roman Emperor]] in 27 BC, Cappadocia become an important and trusted Eastern client kingdom, maintaining its tributary independence under the reorganized [[Roman Empire]]. Archelaus became an important client king for Augustus' Eastern policy. Augustus considered Archelaus as a loyal ruler, making no commitment to convert Cappadocia into a direct province. As a reward for his loyalty, in 25 BC, Augustus assigned to Archelaus the territories of [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]] along the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Lesser Armenia]] along the [[Black Sea]]. Augustus gave Archelaus these additional territories in order to eliminate [[piracy]] in the Eastern Mediterranean and to build a buffer between Rome and the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\n===Roman province===\n\n====During the Principate====\nCappadocia remained an important and trusted eastern client kingdom under [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]]' reign. Rome's policy towards Cappadocia changed, however, following Augustus' death in 14 AD and the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. Years earlier, Tiberius had been slighted by Archelaus when the Cappadocian king showed favor to [[Gaius Caesar]], one of Augustus' grandsons and chief heirs. While Tiberius was in retirement on the Greek island of [[Rhodes]] from 6 BC to 2 AD, though the nominal commander of the Eastern half of the Empire, in 1 BC Archelaus recognized Gaius Caesar, then a military commander subordinate to Tiberius, as Augustus' true representative. Though Gaius Caesar was Augustus' preferred successor, his death in 4 AD while on military campaign in Armenia forced Augustus to adopt Tiberius and name him as his successor.\n\nAssuming the Imperial throne in 14 AD, Tiberius set about a change in Rome's eastern policy. Wanting direct access to Cappadocia's resources and seeking to reduce Archelaus, Tiberius summoned Archelaus to Rome in 17 AD. At the time, Archelaus had governed Cappadocia as Rome's client king for over fifty-years. When he arrived in Rome, Tiberius accused Archelaus of harboring revolutionary schemes and imprisoned him, where he died of natural causes soon thereafter.\n\nSending his adoptive son [[Germanicus]] to oversee Rome's affairs in the East, Tiberius then annexed Cappadocia directly into the Empire by reducing the kingdom into a [[Roman province]]. Tiberius awarded rule of the Roman client [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|kingdom of Armenia]] to Archelaus' step-son [[Artaxias III]] and rule of the Roman client [[Roman Cilicia|kingdom of Cilicia]] to Archelaus' son [[Archelaus of Cilicia|Archelaus II]]. Arriving in the East in 18 AD, Germanicus solidified Roman control over Cappadocia and the region. Under orders from the Emperor, Germanicus also annexing Cappadocia's southeastern neighbor, the client [[Kingdom of Commagene]], into the Empire as a part of the province of [[Roman Syria|Syria]].\n\nFor much the 1st century AD, [[Polemon II of Pontus]] ruled as a Roman client king over the remnants of the former kingdom of Pontus ([[Lesser Armenia]] and [[Roman Georgia|Colchis]]). However, in 62 AD, the Roman Emperor [[Nero]] deposed him and annexed his kingdom into direct imperial ruled by incorporating his former territory into Cappadocia.\n\nBording the [[Euphrates]] river to the east, Cappadocia was the most eastern province of the Empire. Its capital, '''Caesarea''' (modern [[Kayseri]]), was located in more central [[Anatolia]], further back from the Parthian frontier. Upon annexation, the province was governed by a [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Roman equestrian order|Equestrian rank]] with the title ''[[Procurator (Roman)|Procurator]]''. The Procutors commanded only [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary military units]] and looked to the [[Roman Senate|Senatorial]] ranked [[Legatus Augusti pro praetore|Imperial Legate]] of Syria for direction.\n\nFollowing the [[Year of the Four Emperors|Roman civil war of 69]], the Emperor [[Vespasian]] upgraded the province to Senatorial rank, making its governor equal in rank with that of Syria. As a Senatorial province during the middle of the second century AD, Cappadocia retained a permanent military garrison of three [[Roman legion|legions]] and several [[Roman auxiliaries|auxiliary]] units, totally over 28,000 troops. The military presence in Cappadocia served as an important response force against invasions from the [[Parthian Empire]] and allowed the Roman's easy intervention into the affairs of their client kingdom of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]].\n\nThe first Cappadocian to be admitted to the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Roman Senate]] was [[Tiberius Claudius Gordianus]], during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] during the middle second century AD.<ref>Walter Eck, \"Emperor, Senate and Magistrates,\" in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70\u2013192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 219.</ref>\n\n====During the Dominate====\nFollowing the provincial reorganization of [[Diocletian]], the Pontic and Armenian territories were split off, and the province was reduced to the region of Cappadocia proper. It was headed by a ''[[consularis]]'' and came under the [[Diocese of Pontus]]. The province was the site of a great number of imperial estates, as contemporary legislation testifies. On the highway between Constantinople and Antioch Caesarea saw a significant number of imperial visits ([[Itineraries of the Roman emperors, 337-361]]); Valens (363-378) was particularly frequent. The future emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] spent his early years at a remote estate, Macellum. Class divisions between the landowning class and the urban and rural poor were extreme, as was also the climate of this upland plateau.\n\nIn the late 330s, the eastern half of the province was split off to form the provinces of [[Roman Armenia|Armenia Prima]] and [[Roman Armenia|Armenia Secunda]]. In 371, emperor [[Valens]] split off the south-western region around [[Tyana]], which became '''Cappadocia Secunda''' under a ''[[praeses]]'', while the remainder became '''Cappadocia Prima''', still under a ''consularis''.\n\nCappadocia during this period saw a generation of Christian thinkers, the most prominent of whom were [[Basil of Caesarea]], his close friend [[Gregory of Nazianzos]], his younger brother [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and a cousin of the former, [[Amphilochios of Iconium]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\nIn the period 535-553, under emperor [[Justinian I]], the two provinces were rejoined into a single unit under a ''[[proconsul]]''. Throughout late Roman times, the region was subject to raids by the [[Isaurians]], leading to the fortification of local cities. In the early 7th century, the region was briefly captured by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. Following the eruption of the [[Muslim conquests]], repeated raids devastated the region, which became a frontier zone under the new [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ''[[themata]]'' of [[Anatolikon]] and [[Armeniakon]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Roman governors of Cappadocia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n 2.Raymond Van Dam, Kingdom of Snow, University of Pennsylvania Press, \n\n{{Roman provinces AD 117}}\n{{Late Roman Provinces}}\n\n{{coord|38.6706|N|34.8392|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Provinces of the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 10s]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in the 7th century]]\n[[Category:Roman Pontus]]\n[[Category:Roman Cappadocia| ]]\n[[Category:10s establishments in the Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:7th-century disestablishments in the Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:1st-century establishments]]\n[[Category:7th-century disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n[[Category:Historical regions of Anatolia]]\n", "name_user": "Mugsalot", "label": "safe", "comment": "removedCategory:Historical regions of AnatoliausingHotCatRemoved grandparent category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)"}
