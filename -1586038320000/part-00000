After being signed to [[Interscope Records]] and releasing their debut, ''[[Behind the Front]]'' (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \"[[Joints & Jam]]\", and was featured on the ''[[Bulworth]]'' soundtrack.

In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that since 2002, when the group \"hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs \u2013 a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]] worldview.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28503103/review/28565349/the_end_the_energy_never_dies |title=The E.N.D (The Energy Never Dies) |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom ''[[Elephunk]]'' came \"[[Where Is the Love?]]\", which became the Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No.8 on the U.S. Hot 100, but topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No.1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the [[List of best-selling singles by year (UK)|biggest-selling single]] of 2003.

The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original ''Elephunk'' version, \"[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]\" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No.23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first \"silhouette\" television commercial for the [[iPod]]. Their fourth single from the album was titled \"[[Let's Get It Started]]\". It won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song.

Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the [[John Lennon Educational Tour Bus]] while on the Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, \"[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]\", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100. The spot the song reached was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when \"[[Boom Boom Pow]]\" peaked at the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, \"Don't Mess with My Heart\". \"[[Don't Lie]]\", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries. \"[[My Humps]]\", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content; John Bush, writing for [[AllMusic]], described it as \"one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r740971|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic.com}}</ref> Despite this, the album ''Monkey Business'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. ''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later [[RIAA certification|certified]] triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

Their fourth album, ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'', was an even bigger worldwide success, and became certified [[RIAA certification|4\u00d7 Platinum]] in the United States. In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the number-one and number-two spots on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with their singles \"[[Boom Boom Pow]]\" and \"[[I Gotta Feeling]]\", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. \n\nThe album ''[[The E.N.D.]]'' produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"[[Imma Be]]\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with \"[[Rock That Body]]\" and \"[[Meet Me Halfway]]\", which peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10340000/newsid_10340800/10340829.stm |publisher=BBC News|title=Black Eyed Peas set downloads record | date=June 21, 2010}}</ref> At the [[52nd Grammy Awards]] ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations.

After being signed to [[Interscope Records]] and releasing their debut, ''[[Behind the Front]]'' (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \"[[Joints & Jam]]\", and was featured on the ''[[Bulworth]]'' soundtrack. Singer Sierra Swan joined in 1998, appearing on the 1998 song \"Fallin' Up\", before she left in 2000. Their second album, ''[[Bridging the Gap (Black Eyed Peas album)|Bridging the Gap]]'' (2000), produced the singles \"[[Weekends (Black Eyed Peas song)|Weekends]]\" featuring [[Esthero]] and \"[[Request + Line]]\" featuring [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Macy Gray]].

Fergie joined the group in 2002 ''Elephunk'' is also the first album that indicated and demonstrated the new, polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that since 2002, when the group \"hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs \u2013 a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their [[Benetton Group|United Colors of Benetton]] worldview.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28503103/review/28565349/the_end_the_energy_never_dies |title=The E.N.D (The Energy Never Dies) |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom ''[[Elephunk]]'' came \"[[Where Is the Love?]]\", which became the Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No.8 on the U.S. Hot 100, but topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No.1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the [[List of best-selling singles by year (UK)|biggest-selling single]] of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No.1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that [[Justin Timberlake]]'s split with [[Britney Spears]] impacted the recording of \"Where Is The Love?\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Albert Lawrence|title=Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas Talks Justin Timberlake Rap Session & Boom Boom Pow|date=May 6, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpee5Y1eAP0|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}</ref> The album subsequently spawned \"[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]\", which peaked at No.2 in the UK and topped the charts in many success and went [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] and [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets. The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original ''Elephunk'' version, \"[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]\" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No.23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first \"silhouette\" television commercial for the [[iPod]]. Their fourth single from the album was titled \"[[Let's Get It Started]]\". It won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song. In 2004, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on the ''Elephunk Tour'', hitting many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n\n===2004\u20132008: ''Monkey Business''===\n[[File:Black Eyed Peas.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Eyed Peas' apl.de.ap and Fergie in 2005]]\nTheir fourth album, ''[[Monkey Business (The Black Eyed Peas album)|Monkey Business]]'', was recorded through 2004 and was released on June 7, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the [[John Lennon Educational Tour Bus]] while on the Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, \"[[Don't Phunk with My Heart]]\", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100. The spot the song reached was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when \"[[Boom Boom Pow]]\" peaked at the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, \"Don't Mess with My Heart\". \"[[Don't Lie]]\", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries. \"[[My Humps]]\", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content; John Bush, writing for [[AllMusic]], described it as \"one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r740971|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic.com}}</ref> Despite this, the album ''Monkey Business'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. ''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later [[RIAA certification|certified]] triple platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Their next and last commercially released single from the album was \"[[Pump It]]\", which borrows much of its sound from \"[[Misirlou]]\", specifically [[Dick Dale]]'s version; it peaked at number 8 in Australia but 18 in America.\n[[File:Black Eyed Peas at 93rd Grey Cup.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Eye Peas performing in the [[93rd Grey Cup|2005]] [[Grey Cup]] [[List of Grey Cup halftime shows|halftime show]]]]\n[[File:Black Eyed Peas performing.jpg|thumb|right|The Black Eyed Peas performing on August 24, 2006]]\nIn September 2005, the Black Eyed Peas released an ''[[iTunes Originals]]'' playlist of their greatest hits, as well as some that were re-recorded especially for purchase through iTunes.

The European leg which opened in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, continued to Ireland, the UK, France and Germany.\nAfter heading to Europe and Asia, they toured the U.S. again, and South America.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn addition to touring, the Black Eyed Peas also headlined the [[List of Grey Cup halftime shows|halftime show]] at the [[Grey Cup]] on [[93rd Grey Cup|November 27, 2005]].\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas starred in a series of web shorts for [[Snickers]] called Instant Def, appearing as a group of hip-hop superheroes. On March 21, 2006, the Black Eyed Peas released a [[remix]] album, titled ''[[Renegotiations: The Remixes]]'' to [[iTunes]]. It features remixed versions of \"Ba Bump\", \"My Style\", \"Feel It\", \"Disco Club\", \"They Don't Want Music\", \"Audio Delite at Low Fidelity\", and the standard version and video of \"[[Like That (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Like That]]\".

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter.

The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts.

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

The eight aircrew were forbidden to give any defense and, despite the lack of legitimate evidences, were found guilty of participating in aerial military operations against Japan. Five of the eight sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; the other three airmen were taken to a cemetery outside Shanghai, where they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on October 14, 1942.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Doolittle Raid 1942: America's first strike back at Japan (Campaign) |author=Clayton Chun |date=January 31, 2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 85] |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=1-84176-918-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II: The Myths and the Facts |author=Stewart Halsey Ross |date=December 13, 2002 |page=59 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-7864-1412-X}}</ref>\n\nThe Enemy Airmen's Act contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Allied airmen throughout the Pacific War.

In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters&nbsp;... They cut it [into] small pieces and fried it.\"<ref>[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill books, 2002, p. 236.</ref>\n\nIn some cases, flesh was cut from living people: another Indian POW, ''[[Lance Naik]]'' Hatam Ali (later a citizen of [[Pakistan]]), testified in [[New Guinea]] and stated:\n\n{{Quote|...&nbsp;the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers.

The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80&nbsp;km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat.

[[Yoshio Tachibana]] (\u7acb\u82b1\u82b3\u592b,''Tachibana Yoshio''), who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in August 1946 in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, during August 1944, on [[Chichijima incident|Chichi Jima]], in the [[Bonin Islands]]. The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and \"prevention of honorable burial\". Tachibana was sentenced to death, and hanged.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093731/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/yamashita6.htm |date=2006-12-08 }} ''''Case No. 21 Trial Of General Tomoyuki Yamashita[,&#93; United States Military Commission, Manila, (8 October-7 December 1945), and the Supreme Court Of The United States (Judgments Delivered On 4 February 1946).

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''. Columbia University Press</ref>\n\nThe controversy was re-ignited on 1 March 2007, when Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] mentioned suggestions that a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] committee would call on the Japanese Government to \"apologise for and acknowledge\" the role of the Japanese Imperial military in wartime sex slavery. Abe denied that it applied to comfort stations. \"There is no evidence to prove there was coercion, nothing to support it.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/01/AR2007030100578.html |title=''Washington Post'', \"Japan's Abe: no proof of WWII sex slaves\" |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2013-07-21 |first=Hiroko |last=Tabuchi}}</ref> Abe's comments provoked negative reactions overseas.

The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]\nSoon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These numbers included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Koreans.<ref>Dower, John (2000). ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', p. 447</ref> The Class-A charges were all tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as \"the Tokyo Trials\". Other courts were formed in many different places in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Tokyo Trials===\n{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.\n\nHigh-ranking officers who were tried included [[K\u014dichi Kido]] and [[Sadao Araki]]. Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.\n* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir\u014d Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].\n* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

Though the organisation was established by the government, legally, it has been created such that it is an independent charity. The activities of the fund have been controversial in Japan, as well as with international organisations supporting the women concerned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\nSome argue that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. [[California]] [[Congressman]] [[Mike Honda]], speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that \"without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day.

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

Keenan]], the chief prosecutor in the Tokyo Trials, says that the attack on Pearl Harbor not only happened without a declaration of war but was also a [[Betrayal|treacherous]] and [[deceitful]] act. In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace. When a nation employs a deceit and treachery, using periods of negotiations and the negotiations themselves as a cloak to screen a [[perfidy|perfidious]] attack, then there is a prime example of the crime of all crimes.<ref>Keenan, Joseph Berry and Brown, Brendan Francis, ''Crimes against International Law'', Public Affairs Press, Washington, 1950, pp.&nbsp;57\u201387</ref><ref>''Tokyo Transcript'', May 13, 1946, p.491</ref>}}\n\nAdmiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, was fully aware that if Japan lost the war, he would be tried as a war criminal for that attack {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} (although he was killed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[Operation Vengeance]] in 1943).

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot.

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]\nSoon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial.

Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes.

These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement.

Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

They are generally uniform in shape, with heavy bodies, long wings, and moderately long necks. The tails of all but three species are rounded; the exceptions being [[Sabine's gull]] and [[swallow-tailed gull]]s, which have forked tails, and [[Ross's gull]], which has a wedge-shaped tail. Gulls have moderately long legs, especially when compared to the similar terns, with fully webbed feet. The bill is generally heavy and slightly hooked, with the larger species having stouter bills than the smaller species. The bill colour is often yellow with a red spot for the larger white-headed species and red, dark red or black in the smaller species.<ref name = \"HBW\">{{Cite book | first = Alan | last = Burger | first2 = Michael | last2 = Gochfeld | editor-first = Josep | editor-last = del Hoyo | editor2-first = Andrew | editor2-last = Elliott | editor3-last = Sargatal | editor3-first = Jordi | contribution = Family Laridae (Gulls) | title = Handbook of the Birds of the World.

Indeed, they are the least specialised of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and walking. They are more adept walking on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls tend to be more manoeuvrable while walking. The walking gait of gulls includes a slight side to side motion, something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe general pattern of [[plumage]] in adult gulls is a white body with a darker mantle; the extent to which the mantle is darker varies from pale grey to black. A few species vary in this, the [[ivory gull]] is entirely white, and some like the [[lava gull]] and [[Heermann's gull]] have partly or entirely grey bodies. The wingtips of most species are black, which improves their resistance to wear and tear, usually with a diagnostic pattern of white markings. The head of a gull may be covered by a dark hood or be entirely white. The plumage of the head varies by breeding season; in nonbreeding dark-hooded gulls, the hood is lost, sometimes leaving a single spot behind the eye, and in white-headed gulls, nonbreeding heads may have streaking.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n{{See also|List of Charadriiformes by population}}\n[[File:Swallow-tailed-gull.jpg|thumb|[[Swallow-tailed gull]]s are endemic to the Galapagos Islands.]]\nThe gulls have a worldwide [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. They breed on every continent, including the margins of [[Antarctica]], and are found in the high Arctic, as well. They are less common on tropical islands, although a few species do live on islands such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[New Caledonia]]. Many species breed in coastal colonies, with a preference for islands, and one species, the [[grey gull]], breeds in the interior of dry deserts far from water. Considerable variety exists in the family and species may breed and feed in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial habitats.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nMost gull species are [[bird migration|migratory]], with birds moving to warmer habitats during the winter, but the extent to which they migrate varies by species. Some migrate long distances, like [[Franklin's gull]], which migrates from Canada to wintering grounds in the south of South America. Other species move much shorter distances and may simply disperse along the coasts near their breeding sites.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[Charadriiformes|Charadriiform birds]] drink salt water, as well as fresh water, as they possess exocrine glands located in supraorbital grooves of the skull by which salt can be excreted through the nostrils to assist the kidneys in maintaining electrolyte balance.<ref>{{cite web|title = How do seagulls drink saltwater?|url = http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/07/09/how-do-seagulls-drink-saltwater/|date = 9 July 2009|publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]|accessdate = 20 March 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130327102901/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/07/09/how-do-seagulls-drink-saltwater|archivedate=27 March 2013 |url-status = dead|last = Dowdey|first = Sarah}}</ref>\n[[File:Seagull flying in blue sky.jpg|thumb|A gull in flight]]\nGulls are highly adaptable feeders that opportunistically take a wide range of prey. The food taken by gulls includes fish and marine and freshwater invertebrates, both alive and already dead, terrestrial arthropods and invertebrates such as insects and earthworms, rodents, eggs, carrion, offal, reptiles, amphibians, plant items such as seeds and fruit, human refuse, chips {{clarify|date=November 2019}}, and even other birds. No gull species is a single-prey specialist, and no gull species forages using only a single method. The type of food depends on circumstances, and terrestrial prey such as seeds, fruit, and earthworms are more common during the breeding season while marine prey is more common in the nonbreeding season when birds spend more time on large bodies of water.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n[[File:Gulls_foot_paddling.webm|thumb|left|[[Hartlaub's gull]] foot paddling, Cape Town]]\nIn addition to taking a wide range of prey, gulls display great versatility in how they obtain prey. Prey can be obtained in the air, on water, or on land. In the air, a number of hooded species are able to [[Hawking (birds)|hawk]] insects on the wing; larger species perform this feat more rarely. Gulls on the wing also snatch items both off water and off the ground, and over water they also plunge-dive to catch prey. Again, smaller species are more manoeuvrable and better able to hover-dip fish from the air. Dipping is also common when birds are sitting on the water, and gulls may swim in tight circles or foot paddle to bring marine invertebrates up to the surface. Food is also obtained by searching the ground, often on the shore among sand, mud or rocks. Larger gulls tend to do more feeding in this way. In shallow water gulls may also engage in foot paddling.<ref>{{cite journal |first=P.

The time taken to learn foraging skills may explain the delayed maturation in gulls.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nGulls that are known to reside in areas where there is a season of plentiful mice have, over the centuries, developed a specialized method of eating them. First, the gull captures the mouse in a field. Next, the gull flies to a convenient body of water. The gull then regurgitates the mouse and dips it in the water. Biologists who first observed this habit observed it between mating pairs of gulls. This initially led them to believe that the female was washing off the mouse after it had been transported to the breeding area. But when lone gulls, both male and female, began to be seen doing this, it was finally concluded that the mouse, being dry the first time it was swallowed, could become lodged in the gull's throat, a conclusion further corroborated when a male gull was seen to struggle with the ejection of the mouse, the mouse being partially ejected before getting stuck in the gull's throat. After 5 to 6 sizable gulps of water, the mouse was sufficiently moistened to allow the gull to completely eject the mouse. By wetting the mouse, the gull ensures that the mouse does not become lodged in its throat.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nGulls have only a limited ability to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey. To obtain prey from deeper down, many species of gulls feed in association with other animals, where marine hunters drive prey to the surface when hunting.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> Examples of such associations include four species of gulls feeding around plumes of mud brought to the surface by feeding [[grey whale]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=The Association of Marine Birds and Feeding Gray Whales|journal=Condor|year=1979|volume=81|issue=1|pages=93\u201395|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v081n01/p0093-p0095.pdf|doi=10.2307/1367866|jstor=1367866}}</ref> and also between [[orca]]s (largest dolphin species) and [[kelp gull]]s (and other seabirds).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ridoux|first=Vincent|title=Feeding association between seabirds and killer whales, ''Orcinus orca'', around subantarctic Crozet Islands|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1987|volume=65|issue=8|pages=2113\u20132115|doi=10.1139/z87-324}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Kittiwakes.jpg|thumb|[[Black-legged kittiwake]]s nest colonially, but have tiny, closely packed territories]]\nGulls are [[monogamy|monogamous]] and [[seabird colony|colonial]] breeders that display mate fidelity that usually lasts for the life of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of [[philopatry|site fidelity]], returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of [[band-tailed gull]]s may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are [[territory (animal)|territorial]], defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as large as a 5-m radius around the nest in the [[herring gull]] to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the [[kittiwake]]s.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nMost gulls breed once a year and have predictable breeding seasons lasting for three to five months. Gulls begin to assemble around the colony for a few weeks prior to occupying the colony. Existing pairs re-establish their pair-bonds, and unpaired birds begin courting. Birds then move back into their territories and new males establish new territories and attempt to court females. Gulls defend their territories from rivals of both sexes through calls and aerial attacks.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n[[File:Larus marinus eggs.jpg|thumb|The nest of a [[great black-backed gull]], with three typical eggs]]\nNest building is also part of the pair-bonding. Gull nests are usually mats of herbaceous matter with a central nest cup. Nests are usually built on the ground, but a few species build nests on cliffs, including the kittiwakes, which almost always nest in such habitats, and in some cases in trees, and high places like [[Bonaparte's gull]]s. Species that nest in marshes must construct a nesting platform to keep the nest dry, particularly in species that nest in tidal marshes. Both sexes gather nesting material and build the nest, but the division of labour is not always exactly equal.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> In coastal towns, many gulls nest on rooftops and can be observed by nearby human residents.\n\n[[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch size]] is typically three eggs, although it is two in some of the smaller species and only one egg for the swallow-tailed gull. Within colonies, birds synchronise their laying, with synchronisation being higher in larger colonies, although after a certain point, this levels off. The eggs of gulls are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and scrawl markings, and are well camouflaged. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with incubation bouts lasting between one and four hours during the day and one parent incubating through the night.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> Research on various bird species including the gull suggests that females form pair bonds with other females to obtain [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]] for their dependent offspring, a behavior seen in other animal species, like the elephants, wolves, and the [[fathead minnow]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riedman | first1 = Marianne L. | year = 1982 | title = The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 405\u2013435 | doi=10.1086/412936}}</ref>\n\nIncubation lasts between 22 and 26 days, and begins after laying the first egg, although it is discontinuous until the second egg is laid. This means the first two chicks are born close together, and the third chick some time later. Young chicks are brooded by their parents for about one or two weeks, and often at least one parent remains with them, until they [[fledge]], to guard them. Both parents feed the chicks, although early on in the rearing period, the male does most of the feeding and the female most of the brooding and guarding.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n[[File:Black-tailed Gulls, Matsushima, Japan 2008-8-8.webm|thumb|250px|right|Black-tailed gulls following a ferry in [[Matsushima]], [[Japan]]]]\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe family Laridae was introduced (as Laridia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | volume=1815 | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=72 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310150 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=138, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref> The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of gulls is confused by their widespread distribution zones of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] leading to [[geneflow]].

Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus ''[[Larus]]'', but this arrangement is now considered [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]], leading to the resurrection of several genera.<ref name= Pons/> An older name for gulls is '''mews''', cognate with German ''M\u00f6we'', Danish ''m\u00e5ge'', Dutch ''meeuw'', and French ''mouette''; this term can still be found in certain regional dialects.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&resource=Webster%27s&word=Mew&quicksearch=on |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 1913 |access-date=13 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104033543/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&resource=Webster%27s&word=Mew&quicksearch=on |archive-date=4 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mew The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition]</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mew Merriam-Webster Online]</ref>\n\nGulls are typically medium to large birds, usually grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They typically have harsh wailing or squawking calls; stout, longish bills; and webbed feet. Most gulls are ground-nesting [[carnivore]]s which take live food or scavenge opportunistically, particularly the ''Larus'' species. Live food often includes crabs and small fish. Gulls have unhinging jaws which allow them to consume large prey. Gulls are typically coastal or inland species, rarely venturing far out to sea, except for the [[kittiwake]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/herring_gull/lifehistory#at_behavior|title = Herring Gull|work = The Cornell Lab of Ornithology|date = 3 August 2011}}</ref> The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls.

Indeed, they are the least specialised of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and walking. They are more adept walking on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls tend to be more manoeuvrable while walking. The walking gait of gulls includes a slight side to side motion, something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nThe general pattern of [[plumage]] in adult gulls is a white body with a darker mantle; the extent to which the mantle is darker varies from pale grey to black. A few species vary in this, the [[ivory gull]] is entirely white, and some like the [[lava gull]] and [[Heermann's gull]] have partly or entirely grey bodies. The wingtips of most species are black, which improves their resistance to wear and tear, usually with a diagnostic pattern of white markings. The head of a gull may be covered by a dark hood or be entirely white. The plumage of the head varies by breeding season; in nonbreeding dark-hooded gulls, the hood is lost, sometimes leaving a single spot behind the eye, and in white-headed gulls, nonbreeding heads may have streaking.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n{{See also|List of Charadriiformes by population}}\n[[File:Swallow-tailed-gull.jpg|thumb|[[Swallow-tailed gull]]s are endemic to the Galapagos Islands.]]\nThe gulls have a worldwide [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. They breed on every continent, including the margins of [[Antarctica]], and are found in the high Arctic, as well. They are less common on tropical islands, although a few species do live on islands such as the [[Galapagos]] and [[New Caledonia]]. Many species breed in coastal colonies, with a preference for islands, and one species, the [[grey gull]], breeds in the interior of dry deserts far from water. Considerable variety exists in the family and species may breed and feed in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial habitats.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nMost gull species are [[bird migration|migratory]], with birds moving to warmer habitats during the winter, but the extent to which they migrate varies by species. Some migrate long distances, like [[Franklin's gull]], which migrates from Canada to wintering grounds in the south of South America. Other species move much shorter distances and may simply disperse along the coasts near their breeding sites.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[Charadriiformes|Charadriiform birds]] drink salt water, as well as fresh water, as they possess exocrine glands located in supraorbital grooves of the skull by which salt can be excreted through the nostrils to assist the kidneys in maintaining electrolyte balance.<ref>{{cite web|title = How do seagulls drink saltwater?|url = http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/07/09/how-do-seagulls-drink-saltwater/|date = 9 July 2009|publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]|accessdate = 20 March 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130327102901/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2009/07/09/how-do-seagulls-drink-saltwater|archivedate=27 March 2013 |url-status = dead|last = Dowdey|first = Sarah}}</ref>\n[[File:Seagull flying in blue sky.jpg|thumb|A gull in flight]]\nGulls are highly adaptable feeders that opportunistically take a wide range of prey. The food taken by gulls includes fish and marine and freshwater invertebrates, both alive and already dead, terrestrial arthropods and invertebrates such as insects and earthworms, rodents, eggs, carrion, offal, reptiles, amphibians, plant items such as seeds and fruit, human refuse, chips {{clarify|date=November 2019}}, and even other birds. No gull species is a single-prey specialist, and no gull species forages using only a single method. The type of food depends on circumstances, and terrestrial prey such as seeds, fruit, and earthworms are more common during the breeding season while marine prey is more common in the nonbreeding season when birds spend more time on large bodies of water.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n[[File:Gulls_foot_paddling.webm|thumb|left|[[Hartlaub's gull]] foot paddling, Cape Town]]\nIn addition to taking a wide range of prey, gulls display great versatility in how they obtain prey. Prey can be obtained in the air, on water, or on land. In the air, a number of hooded species are able to [[Hawking (birds)|hawk]] insects on the wing; larger species perform this feat more rarely. Gulls on the wing also snatch items both off water and off the ground, and over water they also plunge-dive to catch prey. Again, smaller species are more manoeuvrable and better able to hover-dip fish from the air. Dipping is also common when birds are sitting on the water, and gulls may swim in tight circles or foot paddle to bring marine invertebrates up to the surface. Food is also obtained by searching the ground, often on the shore among sand, mud or rocks. Larger gulls tend to do more feeding in this way. In shallow water gulls may also engage in foot paddling.<ref>{{cite journal |first=P.

The time taken to learn foraging skills may explain the delayed maturation in gulls.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nGulls that are known to reside in areas where there is a season of plentiful mice have, over the centuries, developed a specialized method of eating them. First, the gull captures the mouse in a field. Next, the gull flies to a convenient body of water. The gull then regurgitates the mouse and dips it in the water. Biologists who first observed this habit observed it between mating pairs of gulls. This initially led them to believe that the female was washing off the mouse after it had been transported to the breeding area. But when lone gulls, both male and female, began to be seen doing this, it was finally concluded that the mouse, being dry the first time it was swallowed, could become lodged in the gull's throat, a conclusion further corroborated when a male gull was seen to struggle with the ejection of the mouse, the mouse being partially ejected before getting stuck in the gull's throat. After 5 to 6 sizable gulps of water, the mouse was sufficiently moistened to allow the gull to completely eject the mouse. By wetting the mouse, the gull ensures that the mouse does not become lodged in its throat.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nGulls have only a limited ability to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey. To obtain prey from deeper down, many species of gulls feed in association with other animals, where marine hunters drive prey to the surface when hunting.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> Examples of such associations include four species of gulls feeding around plumes of mud brought to the surface by feeding [[grey whale]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Craig|title=The Association of Marine Birds and Feeding Gray Whales|journal=Condor|year=1979|volume=81|issue=1|pages=93\u201395|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v081n01/p0093-p0095.pdf|doi=10.2307/1367866|jstor=1367866}}</ref> and also between [[orca]]s (largest dolphin species) and [[kelp gull]]s (and other seabirds).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ridoux|first=Vincent|title=Feeding association between seabirds and killer whales, ''Orcinus orca'', around subantarctic Crozet Islands|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1987|volume=65|issue=8|pages=2113\u20132115|doi=10.1139/z87-324}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Kittiwakes.jpg|thumb|[[Black-legged kittiwake]]s nest colonially, but have tiny, closely packed territories]]\nGulls are [[monogamy|monogamous]] and [[seabird colony|colonial]] breeders that display mate fidelity that usually lasts for the life of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of [[philopatry|site fidelity]], returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of [[band-tailed gull]]s may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are [[territory (animal)|territorial]], defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as large as a 5-m radius around the nest in the [[herring gull]] to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the [[kittiwake]]s.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\nMost gulls breed once a year and have predictable breeding seasons lasting for three to five months. Gulls begin to assemble around the colony for a few weeks prior to occupying the colony. Existing pairs re-establish their pair-bonds, and unpaired birds begin courting. Birds then move back into their territories and new males establish new territories and attempt to court females. Gulls defend their territories from rivals of both sexes through calls and aerial attacks.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n[[File:Larus marinus eggs.jpg|thumb|The nest of a [[great black-backed gull]], with three typical eggs]]\nNest building is also part of the pair-bonding. Gull nests are usually mats of herbaceous matter with a central nest cup. Nests are usually built on the ground, but a few species build nests on cliffs, including the kittiwakes, which almost always nest in such habitats, and in some cases in trees, and high places like [[Bonaparte's gull]]s. Species that nest in marshes must construct a nesting platform to keep the nest dry, particularly in species that nest in tidal marshes. Both sexes gather nesting material and build the nest, but the division of labour is not always exactly equal.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> In coastal towns, many gulls nest on rooftops and can be observed by nearby human residents.\n\n[[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch size]] is typically three eggs, although it is two in some of the smaller species and only one egg for the swallow-tailed gull. Within colonies, birds synchronise their laying, with synchronisation being higher in larger colonies, although after a certain point, this levels off. The eggs of gulls are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and scrawl markings, and are well camouflaged. Both sexes incubate the eggs, with incubation bouts lasting between one and four hours during the day and one parent incubating through the night.<ref name = \"HBW\"/> Research on various bird species including the gull suggests that females form pair bonds with other females to obtain [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]] for their dependent offspring, a behavior seen in other animal species, like the elephants, wolves, and the [[fathead minnow]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riedman | first1 = Marianne L. | year = 1982 | title = The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 405\u2013435 | doi=10.1086/412936}}</ref>\n\nIncubation lasts between 22 and 26 days, and begins after laying the first egg, although it is discontinuous until the second egg is laid. This means the first two chicks are born close together, and the third chick some time later. Young chicks are brooded by their parents for about one or two weeks, and often at least one parent remains with them, until they [[fledge]], to guard them. Both parents feed the chicks, although early on in the rearing period, the male does most of the feeding and the female most of the brooding and guarding.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n[[File:Black-tailed Gulls, Matsushima, Japan 2008-8-8.webm|thumb|250px|right|Black-tailed gulls following a ferry in [[Matsushima]], [[Japan]]]]\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe family Laridae was introduced (as Laridia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | volume=1815 | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=72 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310150 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=138, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref> The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of gulls is confused by their widespread distribution zones of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] leading to [[geneflow]].

Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Theresa May]]'s premiership \u2013 a post from which [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned]] in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]] two years later. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the U.K. that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice,\" which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

(UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper but was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper and his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] under [[Theresa May]]'s premiership \u2013 a post from which [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned]] in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]] two years later. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the U.K. that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice,\" which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to their biggest victory since 1987, and biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.
