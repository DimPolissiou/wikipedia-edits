She is perhaps best known for playing the Kryptonian supervillain [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980), and Jinda Kol Rozz in one episode of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' in 2018.\n\nHer other prominent roles include that of the evil Queen Taramis in the 1984 film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', and [[Pamela Lynch]] in the 1980s primetime drama series ''[[Falcon Crest]]'' (1983&ndash;85).\n\n==Early life==\nDouglas was born in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], Warwickshire, the second daughter of Beryl (n\u00e9e Smith), a [[physiotherapist]] who often worked upon [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] actors, and of Edward Douglas, a career member of the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name=yahoo10/> Having been educated locally at [[Alcester Grammar School]], she then trained with the [[National Youth Theatre]] and the [[Rose Bruford College]], before turning professional by working on several productions alongside actors such as [[Roy Dotrice]] and [[Jon Pertwee]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Career==\nEventually, Douglas's career took her in front of the camera with small appearances in the 1973 film ''[[The Final Programme (film)|The Final Programme]]'' (alternatively known as ''The Last Days of Man on Earth'') and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'' in 1975. After this, Douglas became known to British television audiences in the 1970s by appearing in ''[[The Howerd Confessions]]'', the TV version of ''[[Dracula (1973 film)|Dracula]]'', ''The Inheritors'', ''[[Space: 1999]]'' and ''[[Return of the Saint]]'', and appeared in the films ''[[The People That Time Forgot (film)|The People That Time Forgot]]'' and the controversial and rarely seen film ''[[The Brute (1977 film)|The Brute]]'' (1977), in which she played an abused wife.  Douglas' first major role was that of [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' ([[1978 in film|1978]]) and ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), having beaten 600 actresses to the part. In 1984, she played another fantasy villainess in ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' as the evil Queen Taramis. Douglas also continued to appear on television, and was a series regular in the short-lived British sitcom ''Thundercloud'' in 1979. Throughout the 1980s, she went on to appear in a variety of guest roles in UK and US series such as ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]'', ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'' and ''[[Remington Steele]]''. However, her most prominent television role is that of [[Pamela Lynch]] in the primetime soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', which she played for two seasons from 1983&ndash;85. She also played another \"Pamela\" in the 1984 television miniseries ''[[V (The Final Battle)|V: The Final Battle]]''.\n\nIn the 1990s, she returned to science fiction, guest-starring in ''[[Babylon 5]]'' (in the 1994 episode \"[[Deathwalker]]\"), and in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (in the 1998 two-part episode \"[[The Tok'ra (Stargate SG-1)|The Tok'ra]]\"). Douglas has also appeared in a variety of genre films, including ''[[Solarbabies]]'', ''[[The Return of Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time|Beastmaster 2]]'', ''[[Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge]]'' and ''[[Return of the Living Dead 3]]''. She also voiced characters in episodes of several animated TV series, including ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Heavy Gear]]'' and ''[[Batman Beyond|Batman of the Future]]''.\n\n===Recent appearances===\nIn 2003, Douglas returned to the UK to appear in a nationwide tour of ''[[Hamlet]]'' playing alongside actress [[Emily Lloyd]]. The following year, she completed a run in London's West End in the play ''Roast Beef'' playing the role of Clytemnestra. Also in 2004, Douglas completed an audio commentary for the Special Edition DVD of ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]''.\n\nIn 2006, she performed in the [[audio drama]] ''[[The Mystery of the Missing Hour|Sapphire and Steel: The Mystery of the Missing Hour]]'' alongside [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]. Also in 2006, she was reunited with many of her ''[[Superman]]'' co-stars in Los Angeles as a new version of ''[[Superman II]]'' (known as ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'') was released with previously unseen footage. At the same time, a new ''[[Superman]]'' DVD boxset was released, featuring an interview with Douglas.\n\nDouglas went on to appear in the [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Syfy#Sci Fi Pictures original films|Sci-Fi Pictures original film]] ''[[Gryphon (film)|Gryphon]]'', playing the mother of [[Jonathan LaPaglia]]'s character.\n\nIn 2008, Douglas worked on further audio productions, and reunited with [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] for a new BBC Audio CD entitled ''[[The Brightonomicon]]''.

Upon George III's death in 1820, the prince regent became [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. The term '''Regency''' (or '''Regency era''') can refer to various stretches of time; some are longer than the decade of the formal Regency which lasted from 1811 to 1820. The period from 1795 to 1837, which includes the latter part of George III's reign and the reigns of his sons George IV and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], is sometimes regarded as the Regency era, characterised by [[Regency architecture|distinctive trends in British architecture]], [[Regency novel|literature]], [[Regency fashions|fashions]], politics, and culture.\n\n==Society==\nThe Regency is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture. This era encompassed a time of great social, political, and economic change. War was waged with [[Napoleon]] and on other fronts, affecting commerce both at home and internationally, as well as politics. However, despite the bloodshed and [[Napoleonic Wars|warfare]], the Regency was also a period of great refinement and cultural achievement, which shaped and altered the societal structure of Britain as a whole.\n\nOne of the greatest patrons of the arts and architecture was the [[Prince Regent]] himself (the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]). Upper class society flourished in a sort of mini-Renaissance of culture and refinement. As one of the greatest patrons of the arts, the Prince Regent ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the beautiful and exotic [[Brighton Pavilion]], the ornate [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], as well as many other public works and architecture (see [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]], and [[Decimus Burton]]). Naturally, this required dipping into the treasury, and the Regent, and later, the King's exuberance often outstripped his pocket, at the people's expense.<ref>Parissien, Steven. (2001). ''George IV: Inspiration of the Regency''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 117.</ref>\n\nSociety during that period was considerably stratified. In many ways, there was a dark counterpart to the beautiful and fashionable sectors of England of this time. In the dingier, less affluent areas of [[London]], thievery, womanising, gambling, the existence of [[rookery (slum)|rookeries]], and constant drinking ran rampant.<ref name=\"Low_x\">Low, Donald A. (1999). ''The Regency Underworld''. Gloucestershire: Sutton. p. x.</ref> The population boom\u2014comprising an increase from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820<ref name=\"Low_x\"/>\u2014created a wild, roiling, volatile, and vibrant scene. According to [[Robert Southey]], the difference between the strata of society was vast indeed:\n\n<blockquote>The squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of Regency society provided sharp contrast to the Prince Regent's social circle. Poverty was addressed only marginally. The formation of the Regency after the retirement of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] saw the end of a more pious and reserved society, and gave birth of a more frivolous, ostentatious one. This change was influenced by the Regent himself, who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits. This did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction, thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet, as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father.<ref>Smith p. 14.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDriving these changes were not only money and rebellious pampered youth, but also significant technological advancements. In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' adopted steam printing. By this method it could now print 1,100 sheets every hour, not 200 as before\u2014a fivefold increase in production capability and demand.<ref>Morgan, Marjorie. (1994). ''Manners, Morals, and Class in England, 1774\u20131859''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 34.</ref> This development brought about the rise of the wildly popular [[fashionable novel]]s in which publishers spread the stories, rumours, and flaunting of the rich and aristocratic, not so secretly hinting at the specific identity of these individuals. The gap in the hierarchy of society was so great that those of the upper classes could be viewed by those below as wondrous and fantastical fiction, something entirely out of reach yet tangibly there.\n\n==Events==\n;1811:George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales,<ref>{{cite web|title= George IV (r. 1820\u20131830) |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHanoverians/GeorgeIV.aspx|publisher=The Royal Household|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref> began his nine-year tenure as [[Prince Regent|regent]] and became known as ''The Prince Regent''.

Upon George III's death in 1820, the prince regent became [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. The term '''Regency''' (or '''Regency era''') can refer to various stretches of time; some are longer than the decade of the formal Regency which lasted from 1811 to 1820. The period from 1795 to 1837, which includes the latter part of George III's reign and the reigns of his sons George IV and [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], is sometimes regarded as the Regency era, characterised by [[Regency architecture|distinctive trends in British architecture]], [[Regency novel|literature]], [[Regency fashions|fashions]], politics, and culture.\n\n==Society==\nThe Regency is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture. This era encompassed a time of great social, political, and economic change. War was waged with [[Napoleon]] and on other fronts, affecting commerce both at home and internationally, as well as politics. However, despite the bloodshed and [[Napoleonic Wars|warfare]], the Regency was also a period of great refinement and cultural achievement, which shaped and altered the societal structure of Britain as a whole.\n\nOne of the greatest patrons of the arts and architecture was the [[Prince Regent]] himself (the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]). Upper class society flourished in a sort of mini-Renaissance of culture and refinement. As one of the greatest patrons of the arts, the Prince Regent ordered the costly building and refurbishing of the beautiful and exotic [[Brighton Pavilion]], the ornate [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], as well as many other public works and architecture (see [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]], and [[Decimus Burton]]). Naturally, this required dipping into the treasury, and the Regent, and later, the King's exuberance often outstripped his pocket, at the people's expense.<ref>Parissien, Steven. (2001). ''George IV: Inspiration of the Regency''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 117.</ref>\n\nSociety during that period was considerably stratified. In many ways, there was a dark counterpart to the beautiful and fashionable sectors of England of this time. In the dingier, less affluent areas of [[London]], thievery, womanising, gambling, the existence of [[rookery (slum)|rookeries]], and constant drinking ran rampant.<ref name=\"Low_x\">Low, Donald A. (1999). ''The Regency Underworld''. Gloucestershire: Sutton. p. x.</ref> The population boom\u2014comprising an increase from just under a million in 1801 to one and a quarter million by 1820<ref name=\"Low_x\"/>\u2014created a wild, roiling, volatile, and vibrant scene. According to [[Robert Southey]], the difference between the strata of society was vast indeed:\n\n<blockquote>The squalor that existed beneath the glamour and gloss of Regency society provided sharp contrast to the Prince Regent's social circle. Poverty was addressed only marginally. The formation of the Regency after the retirement of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] saw the end of a more pious and reserved society, and gave birth of a more frivolous, ostentatious one. This change was influenced by the Regent himself, who was kept entirely removed from the machinations of politics and military exploits. This did nothing to channel his energies in a more positive direction, thereby leaving him with the pursuit of pleasure as his only outlet, as well as his sole form of rebellion against what he saw as disapproval and censure in the form of his father.<ref>Smith p. 14.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDriving these changes were not only money and rebellious pampered youth, but also significant technological advancements. In 1814, ''[[The Times]]'' adopted steam printing. By this method it could now print 1,100 sheets every hour, not 200 as before\u2014a fivefold increase in production capability and demand.<ref>Morgan, Marjorie. (1994). ''Manners, Morals, and Class in England, 1774\u20131859''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 34.</ref> This development brought about the rise of the wildly popular [[fashionable novel]]s in which publishers spread the stories, rumours, and flaunting of the rich and aristocratic, not so secretly hinting at the specific identity of these individuals. The gap in the hierarchy of society was so great that those of the upper classes could be viewed by those below as wondrous and fantastical fiction, something entirely out of reach yet tangibly there.\n\n==Events==\n;1811:George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales,<ref>{{cite web|title= George IV (r. 1820\u20131830) |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHanoverians/GeorgeIV.aspx|publisher=The Royal Household|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref> began his nine-year tenure as [[Prince Regent|regent]] and became known as ''The Prince Regent''.

One day, two elderly men who were guests of Susanna's wealthy husband Joakim, lusted for Susanna, who was described as \"The Beautiful Susanna\". The elders{{snds}}who were judges and respectable members of the community{{snds}}came to an agreement that they would wait until Susanna was alone in the garden and then have their way with her.

The two prominent elders of the community then publicly denounced her, falsely accusing her of committing adultery with a young man. According to ancient Jewish law, adultery was punishable by death, and Susanna was condemned to death after everyone believed the two judges' story. Upset and crying, Susanna was taken away to be executed. She turned to God, calling upon him to prove her innocence. A young man named Daniel was standing in the crowd watching. While witnessing the procession Daniel heard the voice of an angel. The angel urged him to speak up and prevent the killing of an innocent woman who was being framed for doing something she had not done. (The young Daniel would later be known as the prophet Daniel.) The young man, surprised, felt obliged to halt the execution. He asked to be allowed to interrogate the two elders separately so that they could not speak to each other. Daniel then cross-examined the judges on how they had discovered Susanna, what the young man looked like, where they secretly met and so on. He kept receiving contradictory answers from the elders. When asked under which tree Susanna had committed adultery, the two elders gave very different answers and named different kinds of trees. The elderly judges were exposed for lying and for bearing false witness{{snds}}a capital crime according to ancient Jewish law. Daniel proved Susanna was innocent, and she was freed while the elders were condemned.<ref name=\"Google Cultural Institute\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/t/tintoret/6/06susan2.html|title=Susanna and the Elders (detail) by TINTORETTO|work=wga.hu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/33609/Titian--Tintoretto--Veronese--Rivals-in-Renaissance-Venice-at-the-Louvre#.VRIWM48V_cs|title=Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese: Rivals in Renaissance Venice at the Louvre|work=artdaily.com}}</ref>\n\n==Painting==\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto - Susanna and the Elders (detail) - WGA22658.jpg|thumb|''Susanna and the Elders'',  detail]]\nThe painting is a sumptuous work showing a naked Susanna sitting in a garden beside a pool, leaning against a tree, and facing a dense rose trellis, against which leans a mirror. Susanna gazes into the mirror. Around her on the ground are several bright objects including a white silk shawl, pearls, jewelry, a comb, and silverware, which together form a kind of still life. Susanna's body is contrasted in a masterful way against the dark mass of the rose trellis, and the dark water, while the bodies of the three figures form a triangle. Sunlight falls on parts of Susanna's face and body, which Tintoretto has worked out as a [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro effect]]. The lines of the slightly forced perspective of the rose trellis draw the viewer into the scene, opening up new vistas through the arch in the background and adding depth to the painting.<ref name=\"oneonta.edu\"/><ref name=\"Google Cultural Institute\"/> Two elderly men peer around either end of the rose trellis to watch her. Tintoretto's fascination with materials and colours can be seen in the treatment of the dim silvery light that illuminates Susanna's sumptuous body with crystalline clarity. The light reflects on her complexion and on the small and skillfully painted still life at her feet, contrasting with the rich shadows. Susanna is depicted in a sensual manner with  elaborately braided hair. She is sitting absorbed by her reflection in the mirror and unaware of the intruders. The viewer is, of course, well aware of the two men, who seem just about move toward her, releasing the tension of the scene and adding a certain drama to the painting. \n\nThe rose trellis is setted between two trees. The trunk of the front tree extends like a line over the entire height of the image and divides it into two sections: a left one, which only covers about 20 percent of the image area, and a much larger right one, which takes up about 80 percent.\n\nA [[Eurasian magpie|magpie]] is sitting on a branch to the right above Susanna, behind it one can see a [[Sambucus|bush of elder]]. A [[Anatidae|family of ducks]] is swimming in the river on the right behind an old man. The narrow garden area with the swimming pool is delimited by a wooden fence in addition to the rose hedge. The poles in the entrance area are designed as [[Caryatid|caryatides]]. Through the entrance, the view opens into a spacious garden landscape with a river, meadows and forest. On the river bank in the background you can see a [[deer]] and a hind. A closer look reveals the outline of a city surrounded by water, which is most likely the [[Lagoon|lagoon city]] of [[Venice]] - Tintoretto's home.\n\n== Interpretation ==\n[[File: Tintoretto - Susanna and the Elders - detail Venice Deer.jpg|thumb|J. T .: Susanna and the Elders (detail): deer and hind in the foreground, trees behind and the outline of Venice]]\n\nFor his depiction of the subject of the [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|biblical story]], Tintoretto chooses a scene in which Susanna seems so absorbed in her reflection that she does not notice the two ambushed, voyeuristic and defamatory old people. In addition, the artist places the act of Susanna so clearly in the spotlight using the technique of chiaroscuro that the viewer himself becomes a voyeur.\n\nIn order to clarify the moral message contained in the biblical narrative, Tintoretto uses animal<ref>[https://books.google.at/books?id=iBSDddO-9PoC&dq=%22Animal+Symbolism%22&hl=de&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art''.] by Hope B. Werness, published by A&C Black, 01.01.2006.</ref> and [[color symbolism]]. The magpie stands for the impending defamation, the ducks for loyalty, the roses for lust. The [[white]] of the elder flowers and the objects next to Susanna stand for innocence and purity. The red robe of the elders signals danger and [[lust]]. The deer stands for desire and lust,<ref>[http://books.google.at/books?id=oeQxUX_BcYoC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Tiersymbole+Hirsch+Wollust&source=bl&ots=uKPjCxSnv4&sig=xWUfTs3AKbSb7AdUZ8s69OJV36M&hl=de&sa=X&ei=8SjSU7ewC8To7AbB-oHQBQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Tiersymbole%20Hirsch%20Wollust&f=false  ''Die Dame im Spiel''] by Ulrike W\u00f6rner, pages 144\u2013145, published by Waxmann Verlag, 2010. (German)</ref> to be interpreted.\n\nThe front tree trunk divides the painting into two parts, which could be interpreted as two scenes. The outline-like representation of Venice in the smaller left part of the picture suggests that the bathing Susanna in the larger right part symbolizes the lagoon city of Venice. In addition, the deeras a sign of desire can be seen in connection with the political events at the time of the creation of Tintoretto's painting: Around the middle of the 16th century, Venice was under threat by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], because since the [[Battle of Preveza]] the Ottoman fleet has become the leading naval power in the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article122539934/Vier-Schiffsgiganten-besiegten-die-tuerkische-Flotte.html ''Vier Schiffsgiganten besiegten die t\u00fcrkische Flotte.''] Article by Berthold Seewald, [[Die Welt]], 04-12-2013.

(German)</ref> Suleiman's rule even extends to the area of \u200b\u200bthe former [[Babylon]], where the story depicted by Tintoretto has taken place. Accordingly, the two old men in the painting are emblematic of the Ottomans who desire the beautiful, rich city of Venice.\n\nWith Susanna as a personified representation of Venice and the deer as a symbol of lust, the picture could also be interpreted as a hidden criticism of Venetian society at Tintoretto's time. The numerous [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] of the city were made the [[scapegoat | scapegoats]] of venereal diseases such as [[syphilis]], which affected Venice in the form of fatal [[epidemic]].<ref>[http://www.michael-mueller-verlag.de/de/reiseportal/reisereportage/wussten_sie_dass_venedig_zeitreise.html ''St\u00e4dtef\u00fchrer Venedig MM-City.

(German)</ref>  Susanna is considered innocent both in the biblical narrative and in the image of Tintoretto. In a figurative sense, this could mean that Tintoretto does not denounce the prostitutes of Venice, but the men who - despite the threat of infection persistently indulging in their lust - use their services, but shift the blame for sexually transmitted diseases onto women.\n\n== History ==\nTintoretto's '' Susanna and the Elders '' from 1555/56 is one of several works on the same subject from the artist's studio.

Daniel proved Susanna was innocent, and she was freed while the elders were condemned.<ref name=\"Google Cultural Institute\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/t/tintoret/6/06susan2.html|title=Susanna and the Elders (detail) by TINTORETTO|work=wga.hu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/33609/Titian--Tintoretto--Veronese--Rivals-in-Renaissance-Venice-at-the-Louvre#.VRIWM48V_cs|title=Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese: Rivals in Renaissance Venice at the Louvre|work=artdaily.com}}</ref>\n\n==Painting==\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto - Susanna and the Elders (detail) - WGA22658.jpg|thumb|''Susanna and the Elders'',  detail]]\nThe painting is a sumptuous work showing a naked Susanna sitting in a garden beside a pool, leaning against a tree, and facing a dense rose trellis, against which leans a mirror. Susanna gazes into the mirror. Around her on the ground are several bright objects including a white silk shawl, pearls, jewelry, a comb, and silverware, which together form a kind of still life. Susanna's body is contrasted in a masterful way against the dark mass of the rose trellis, and the dark water, while the bodies of the three figures form a triangle. Sunlight falls on parts of Susanna's face and body, which Tintoretto has worked out as a [[Chiaroscuro|chiaroscuro effect]]. The lines of the slightly forced perspective of the rose trellis draw the viewer into the scene, opening up new vistas through the arch in the background and adding depth to the painting.<ref name=\"oneonta.edu\"/><ref name=\"Google Cultural Institute\"/> Two elderly men peer around either end of the rose trellis to watch her. Tintoretto's fascination with materials and colours can be seen in the treatment of the dim silvery light that illuminates Susanna's sumptuous body with crystalline clarity. The light reflects on her complexion and on the small and skillfully painted still life at her feet, contrasting with the rich shadows. Susanna is depicted in a sensual manner with  elaborately braided hair. She is sitting absorbed by her reflection in the mirror and unaware of the intruders. The viewer is, of course, well aware of the two men, who seem just about move toward her, releasing the tension of the scene and adding a certain drama to the painting. \n\nThe rose trellis is setted between two trees. The trunk of the front tree extends like a line over the entire height of the image and divides it into two sections: a left one, which only covers about 20 percent of the image area, and a much larger right one, which takes up about 80 percent.\n\nA [[Eurasian magpie|magpie]] is sitting on a branch to the right above Susanna, behind it one can see a [[Sambucus|bush of elder]]. A [[Anatidae|family of ducks]] is swimming in the river on the right behind an old man. The narrow garden area with the swimming pool is delimited by a wooden fence in addition to the rose hedge. The poles in the entrance area are designed as [[Caryatid|caryatides]]. Through the entrance, the view opens into a spacious garden landscape with a river, meadows and forest. On the river bank in the background you can see a [[deer]] and a hind. A closer look reveals the outline of a city surrounded by water, which is most likely the [[Lagoon|lagoon city]] of [[Venice]] - Tintoretto's home.\n\n== Interpretation ==\n[[File: Tintoretto - Susanna and the Elders - detail Venice Deer.jpg|thumb|J. T .: Susanna and the Elders (detail): deer and hind in the foreground, trees behind and the outline of Venice]]\n\nFor his depiction of the subject of the [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|biblical story]], Tintoretto chooses a scene in which Susanna seems so absorbed in her reflection that she does not notice the two ambushed, voyeuristic and defamatory old people. In addition, the artist places the act of Susanna so clearly in the spotlight using the technique of chiaroscuro that the viewer himself becomes a voyeur.\n\nIn order to clarify the moral message contained in the biblical narrative, Tintoretto uses animal<ref>[https://books.google.at/books?id=iBSDddO-9PoC&dq=%22Animal+Symbolism%22&hl=de&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art''.] by Hope B. Werness, published by A&C Black, 01.01.2006.</ref> and [[color symbolism]]. The magpie stands for the impending defamation, the ducks for loyalty, the roses for lust. The [[white]] of the elder flowers and the objects next to Susanna stand for innocence and purity. The red robe of the elders signals danger and [[lust]]. The deer stands for desire and lust,<ref>[http://books.google.at/books?id=oeQxUX_BcYoC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Tiersymbole+Hirsch+Wollust&source=bl&ots=uKPjCxSnv4&sig=xWUfTs3AKbSb7AdUZ8s69OJV36M&hl=de&sa=X&ei=8SjSU7ewC8To7AbB-oHQBQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Tiersymbole%20Hirsch%20Wollust&f=false  ''Die Dame im Spiel''] by Ulrike W\u00f6rner, pages 144\u2013145, published by Waxmann Verlag, 2010. (German)</ref> to be interpreted.\n\nThe front tree trunk divides the painting into two parts, which could be interpreted as two scenes. The outline-like representation of Venice in the smaller left part of the picture suggests that the bathing Susanna in the larger right part symbolizes the lagoon city of Venice. In addition, the deeras a sign of desire can be seen in connection with the political events at the time of the creation of Tintoretto's painting: Around the middle of the 16th century, Venice was under threat by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], because since the [[Battle of Preveza]] the Ottoman fleet has become the leading naval power in the Mediterranean Sea.<ref[https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article122539934/Vier-Schiffsgiganten-besiegten-die-tuerkische-Flotte.html ''Vier Schiffsgiganten besiegten die t\u00fcrkische Flotte.''] Article by Berthold Seewald, [[Die Welt]], 04-12-2013.

(German)</ref> Suleiman's rule even extends to the area of \u200b\u200bthe former [[Babylon]], where the story depicted by Tintoretto has taken place. Accordingly, the two old men in the painting are emblematic of the Ottomans who desire the beautiful, rich city of Venice.\n\nWith Susanna as a personified representation of Venice and the deer as a symbol of lust, the picture could also be interpreted as a hidden criticism of Venetian society at Tintoretto's time. The numerous [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] of the city were made the [[scapegoat | scapegoats]] of venereal diseases such as [[syphilis]], which affected Venice in the form of fatal [[epidemic]].<ref>[http://www.michael-mueller-verlag.de/de/reiseportal/reisereportage/wussten_sie_dass_venedig_zeitreise.html ''St\u00e4dtef\u00fchrer Venedig MM-City.

(German)</ref>  Susanna is considered innocent both in the biblical narrative and in the image of Tintoretto. In a figurative sense, this could mean that Tintoretto does not denounce the prostitutes of Venice, but the men who - despite the threat of infection persistently indulging in their lust - use their services, but shift the blame for sexually transmitted diseases onto women.\n\n== History ==\nTintoretto's '' Susanna and the Elders '' from 1555/56 is one of several works on the same subject from the artist's studio. One of the pictures is exhibited at the [[Louvre]], the [[Museo del Prado]] and in the [[National Gallery of Art|NGA Washington]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"250\">\nJacopo Robusti dit Le Tintoret - Suzanne au Bain - Louvre 568.jpg|J.

The park is similar to the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] since it also contains selected attractions from Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\nThe park opened on 31 March 2001. Over 11 million guests visited the park in its opening year, making it the world's fastest amusement park to have achieved the 10 million milestone at the time. Since then, Universal Studios Japan has had approximately 8 million visitors every year. Most visitors are Japanese tourists and tourists from other Asian countries such as South Korea and China. It is also very popular among [[Western world|Western]] tourists and expatriates. In 2005, [[Goldman Sachs]] became the largest shareholder in Universal Studios Japan.\n\nVarious events were held in the year 2011 to celebrate the park's tenth anniversary, by which time a total of 88 million guests had cumulatively attended the park. There were 700,000 annual passport holders in June 2012 and in the 2012 fiscal year, 9.75 million guests visited the park. During the 2013 fiscal year, Universal Studios Japan received 10.5 million guests. Various factors contributed to this growth in 2013, including the opening of the backwards roller coaster \"[[Hollywood Dream \u2013 The Ride]]: Backdrop\" in March, and the \"New Amazing Adventure of Spider-Man - The Ride 4K3D\" in July, which installed new 4KHD technology, which proved to be popular among the younger generation. The family area \"Universal Wonderland\" which opened in March 2012 also attracted many families.\n\nRecent installments include limited-time attractions such as \"[[Resident Evil|Biohazard]] - The Real\" and \"[[Monster Hunter]] - The Real\", both based on popular video game franchises, and \"[[One Piece]] Premier Show\", which is based on the popular anime series, providing attractions based on entertainment worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.japantravel.com/osaka/universal-cool-japan-2016-usj/26048|title=Universal Cool Japan 2016 - Osaka - Japan Travel - Tourism Guide, Japan Map and Trip Planner|website=JapanTravel|access-date=2016-03-14}}</ref> On 15 July 2014, [[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios Japan)|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter]], a themed area based on the blockbuster ''Harry Potter'' film series, opened to the public.<ref name=\"Variety Media\">{{cite web | title= Universal Studios Japan to Open Wizarding World of Harry Potter in July | accessdate=2014-04-18 | url= https://variety.com/2014/biz/news/universal-studios-japan-to-open-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-in-july-1201159526/ | publisher= Variety Media }}</ref> The popular ride The Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, located in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, was revamped to play in 3D only 10 months after its opening as the first ride of its kind in the world.<ref name=\"themeparkinsider\">{{cite web | title= Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey: Now in 3D | accessdate=2015-05-20 | url= http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201505/4566/ | publisher= themeparkinsider }}</ref> With a total investment of 45 billion yen, the addition of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to the park is projected to have an economic ripple effect of 5 trillion 60 million yen over the next 10 years in Japan, and anticipates many visitors from both Japan and overseas.<ref name=\"Variety Media\"/>\n\nOn Monday, 29 October 2012, Universal Studios Japan greeted its 100 millionth visitor since its opening in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2012/10/190633.html|title=Universal Studios Japan visitors top 100 million|accessdate=2 Nov 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122001022/http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2012/10/190633.html|archivedate=2013-01-22}}</ref> According to the 2014 Theme Index Global Attraction Attendance Report, Universal Studios Japan is ranked fifth among the top 25 amusement/theme parks worldwide, attracting 11.8 million visitors in 2014, 16.8% more than in the previous year.<ref name=\"2014 attendance\">{{cite web|title=GLOBAL ATTRACTIONS ATTENDANCE REPORT|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_103_49736_150603.pdf|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=June 3, 2015|year=2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626102318/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_103_49736_150603.pdf|archive-date=June 26, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On 27 February 2020, Universal announced a closure of the park until 22 March 2020 to combat the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

From 1602 to 1606 the \"freemen\", leading citizens of Carrickfergus, obtained the right to redistribute this area of land from the [[The Crown|Crown]], renaming the area the ''West Division'' - a name which remains legal today.<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" />\n\nFarmland was distributed in strips from Knockagh Hill, to the shore of [[Belfast Lough]] and lanes were constructed to provide access to the farms and their houses, including important residences such as ''Castle Lugg''. The most notable of these was Longfield Lane, which was eventually widened and surfaced to provide access to the railway station, becoming the Station Road.<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" /> Many of the lanes also remain in their original narrow state, such as Neill's Lane and Windfield Lane both of which run north from the Shore Road on either side of Greenisland.\n\nIn the 1800s, following the growth of [[Belfast]] towards the end of the 18th century, several bathing lodges used for summer recreation were established in the area.<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" /> One such lodge is still standing today and has been transformed into \"Ravenhill Nursing Home\" by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.<ref name=\"RavenhillNursingHome\">http://www.carehome.co.uk/carehome.cfm/searchazref/20007005RAVA Ravenhill Nursing Home</ref> During this period, Bassett's directory of 1888 notes that the area was \"devoted entirely to handsome residences occupied for the greater part by gentlemen engaged in commercial and professional pursuits in Belfast\".<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" />\n\nThe Belfast-to-[[Ballymena]] railway line was opened in 1845, which travelled through the area, providing one of the first transport links to the town from both Belfast and Carrickfergus. The village was finally given the official name of ''Greenisland'' in 1893 when the Greenisland railway station was constructed in its present site. Improvements in transport and a growth in prosperity led to more semi-detached and terraced houses in the area immediately surrounding the railway station.\n\nIn 1859, the Christian Revival that swept Ulster arrived in Greenisland and an open-air service was held in the field below Longfield Farm (now known locally as Johnstone Farm) which is still standing on the Station Road. By 1860 the interdenominational Ebenezer Hall was built for worshippers on the Shore Road. This was then followed in 1912 when the Presbyterian Knockagh Hall was built on the Upper Road. Neither of these buildings survive, but the congregations of these two churches remain. With Greenisland Ebenezer Church of the Nazarene now in Longfield Gardens and Greenisland Presbyterian Church on the Upper Road. Over the years they have been joined by several other churches as Greenisland has grown.\n\nGreenisland Primary School replaced a school in Trooperslane in 1938, when it was realised that children had to walk two miles to Trooperslane and back every day. On the opening day, pupils arrived at the Trooperslane school and then walked to the new school carrying armfuls of books, jars of ink and other learning materials.<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the new school's headmaster, as an Army reservist, was called into action. Soon after, an air-raid shelter was built in the playground and gas masks were placed under desks, where the pupils would store their bags. Village residents formed a Home Guard and Civil Defence Post and air-raid drills became regular free 'entertainment' in the evenings. Stirrup pumps were issued to put out fires and proved very useful for watering gardens during the summer. The name on the outside of the school was covered during the war so that any German parachutists landing in Greenisland would be disorientated, not knowing where they were.<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" />\n\nIn [[Belfast Blitz|Easter 1941]], when a [[Nazi Germany|German]] plane was reported to have flown up the [[Belfast Lough|Lough]] towards Belfast, the anti-aircraft battery on Neill's Lane opened fire. It was the only occasion during the war that necessitated the air-raid shelters in Greenisland. The guns did not bring down any aircraft and only managed to crack some windows in the village. However, it was soon realised that a full-scale attack had been waged on the city of Belfast (today known as the [[Belfast Blitz]], the greatest loss of life outside [[London]] during [[the Blitz]]) and the village's [[Air Raid Precautions]] volunteers disappeared into Belfast for several days to help with the recovery.<ref name=\"Between-HistOverview\" />\n\n==Local landmarks==\n[[File:Knockagh Memorial, Co Antrim.jpg|thumb|The [[Knockagh Monument]], which overlooks Greenisland]]\n*'''The [[Knockagh Monument]]''', a [[basalt]] [[obelisk]] erected as a memorial to the citizens of [[County Antrim]] who died during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

A small excavation was carried out at the site in 1980, but failed to establish a precise date of layout of the structure; documentary evidence suggest it existed by 1570. It is still much as it was when described in 1839, with the remains of the N wall, 8m long x 1.2m thick x c.5m high & a fragment of the E wall surviving at the NE corner.

In preparation for this, public consultations were conducted and relevant properties purchased. Conor Murphy the then Regional Development Minister stated in June 2010 that subject to \"finances being available, delivery is expected to start in 2011-12, and the project should be completed in 2013\". This was then further delayed until finances could be found.\n\nOn 14 February 2012 it was confirmed in a press conference at [[Stormont House|Stormont]] by Edwin Poots, Martin McGuinness, Peter Robinson and Danny Kennedy that \"\u00a357m (would) be spent on improving the A2 Carrickfergus to Belfast road.\"\n\nOn 31 January 2013 the contract for the widening of the A2 shore road was awarded to Graham Construction.
