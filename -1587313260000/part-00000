Among the most abundant sharks inhabiting the [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s, this species prefers shallow, inshore waters. Its exposed first dorsal fin is a common sight in the region. The blacktip reef shark is usually found over reef ledges and sandy flats, though it has also been known to enter [[brackish]] and [[freshwater]] environments. It typically attains a length of {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe blacktip reef shark has extremely small home ranges and exhibits strong site fidelity, remaining within the same local area for up to several years at a time. It is an active [[predator]] of small [[bony fish]]es, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, and has also been known to feed on [[sea snake]]s and [[seabird]]s. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is [[viviparity|viviparous]], with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the [[gestation period]] range from 7\u20139, through 10\u201311, to possibly 16 months. [[Mating]] is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by [[high tide]].\n\nTimid and skittish, the blacktip reef shark is difficult to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water are at risk of having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and [[shark liver oil|liver oil]], but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed the blacktip reef shark as [[Near Threatened]]. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, [[overfishing]] of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Carcharhinus melanopterus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=View from above of a brown shark with a rounded snout, swimming over algae-covered rocks|A blacktip reef shark in the Solomon Islands]]\nFrench [[naturalist]]s [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] originally described the blacktip reef shark during the 1817\u20131820 exploratory voyage of the [[corvette]] ''Uranie''. In 1824, their account was published as part of ''Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne'', [[Louis de Freycinet]]'s 13-volume report on the voyage. The [[type specimen]] was a {{convert|59|cm|in|abbr=on}}-long juvenile male caught off the island of [[Waigeo]], west of [[New Guinea]].<ref name=\"compagno\"/> Quoy and Gaimard chose the name ''Carcharias melanopterus'', from the Greek ''melas'' meaning \"black\" and ''pteron'' meaning \"fin\" or \"wing\", in reference to this shark's prominent fin markings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Poissons de l'Oc\u00e9an Indien, les \u00eeles Maldives |author1=Nouguier, J.  |author2=D.

The sharks spend most of their time swimming back and forth along reef ledges, making occasional short forays onto sandy flats.

Among the most abundant sharks inhabiting the [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s, this species prefers shallow, inshore waters. Its exposed first dorsal fin is a common sight in the region. The blacktip reef shark is usually found over reef ledges and sandy flats, though it has also been known to enter [[brackish]] and [[freshwater]] environments. It typically attains a length of {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe blacktip reef shark has extremely small home ranges and exhibits strong site fidelity, remaining within the same local area for up to several years at a time. It is an active [[predator]] of small [[bony fish]]es, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, and has also been known to feed on [[sea snake]]s and [[seabird]]s. Accounts of the blacktip reef shark's life history have been variable and sometimes contradictory, in part reflecting geographical differences within the species. Like other members of its family, this shark is [[viviparity|viviparous]], with females giving birth to two to five young on a biennial, annual, or possibly biannual cycle. Reports of the [[gestation period]] range from 7\u20139, through 10\u201311, to possibly 16 months. [[Mating]] is preceded by the male following closely behind the female, likely attracted by her chemical signals. Newborn sharks are found further inshore and in shallower water than adults, frequently roaming in large groups over areas flooded by [[high tide]].\n\nTimid and skittish, the blacktip reef shark is difficult to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water are at risk of having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and [[shark liver oil|liver oil]], but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed the blacktip reef shark as [[Near Threatened]]. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, [[overfishing]] of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Carcharhinus melanopterus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=View from above of a brown shark with a rounded snout, swimming over algae-covered rocks|A blacktip reef shark in the Solomon Islands]]\nFrench [[naturalist]]s [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] originally described the blacktip reef shark during the 1817\u20131820 exploratory voyage of the [[corvette]] ''Uranie''. In 1824, their account was published as part of ''Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne'', [[Louis de Freycinet]]'s 13-volume report on the voyage.

It features [[Lorenzo Music]] as the voice of [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] the house cat, other regulars Thom Huge and [[Gregg Berger]], and guest star [[Wolfman Jack]]. It originally aired on [[CBS]] on May 27, 1986.\n\nThis was the fifth of twelve [[Garfield television specials]] made between 1982 and 1991. The story concerns the characters visiting a tropical vacation destination. The special was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] and has been released on [[DVD]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jon Arbuckle|Jon]] and [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] take their third class airline trip to Paradise World, a cheapskate's version of [[Hawaii]]. Jon and Garfield check in at a squalid motel and are soon disappointed to find out that there is no beach within sight of the motel, and only an empty swimming pool in the back. When Jon and Garfield enter their room, they find [[Odie]] hiding in their luggage. None of the trio has any fun until Jon, Garfield, and Odie plan to rent a car and search for a beach around the island. For a cheap price, they get a really nice and classic [[Chevrolet Bel Air]] to hit the beach and later begin to choose where to go when their car mysteriously speeds into a jungle on its own, stopping in the middle of a native village. Jon, Garfield, and Odie presume that they are in trouble until the natives begin kowtowing to their car. They meet the tribal chief (The High Ramma-Lamma) who explains that the villagers (The Ding-Dongs) learned English \"from watching a lot of [[Beach Blanket Bingo|beach movies]]\", and that in 1957, the Cruiser, a [[James Dean]]/[[Fonzie]]-styled legend, drove his car into the village and introduced the people to the 1950s pop culture. The Cruiser eventually saved the village by sacrificing himself and driving his car into a nearby volcano to prevent it from erupting. The village is now devoted to a 1950s lifestyle and believes that Jon's rental car is actually the same one the Cruiser owned.\n\nIn the village, Jon and Garfield find romance with the tribal princess, Owooda, and her cat, Mai-Tai. Meanwhile, the chief orders the [[village idiot]], Monkey, to fix the car with Odie's assistance. Suddenly, the volcano begins to erupt and Owooda tells Jon that she and Mai-Tai must sacrifice themselves to save the village. However, the volcano rejects Owooda and Mai-Tai, and the village shaman, Pigeon, interprets that it wants the car instead, and if it does not have the car within thirty seconds, it will blow the island to pieces. Monkey and Odie make their final attempt to get the car fixed, which still does not work until Odie merely taps the [[distributor cap]] with a hammer. The car finally starts and zooms through the village and up the volcano with Monkey driving and Odie hanging onto the hood. The car plummets into the crater, the volcano finally erupts, and the Cruiser's spirit and car's ghost drift out, speed off, and vanish into the night sky; the volcano is now at peace. Monkey and Odie are presumed dead until Garfield sees them climb out of the crater unharmed (apparently, the two never checked the brakes), and Jon, Garfield, and the other villagers carry Monkey and Odie back to the village in a hero's fashion.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Lorenzo Music]] as Garfield\n* Thom Huge as Jon Arbuckle\n* [[Gregg Berger]] as Odie/Piegon\n* [[Wolfman Jack]] as the Chief\n* [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] as Hotel Clerk/Salesman\n* [[Desir\u00e9e Goyette]] as Owooda\n* [[Julie Payne (actress, born 1946)|Julie Payne]] as Mai-Tai/Stewardess\n* [[Nino Tempo]] as Monkey\n* Carolyn Davis as Female Cat\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Off-screen voice\n\n==Songs==\n* \"Inversion Layer Airlines Jingle\" performed by [[Desir\u00e9e Goyette]]\n* \"Hello, Hawaii (Can I Come Over?)\" performed by [[Lou Rawls]] and [[Desir\u00e9e Goyette]]\n* \"Beauty and the Beach\" performed by [[Lou Rawls]], Thom Huge, and [[Lorenzo Music]]\n* \"When I Saw You\" performed by Thom Huge and [[Desir\u00e9e Goyette]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Wolfman Jack 1977.JPG|150px|left|thumb|Disc jockey [[Wolfman Jack]] guest starred in the special.]]\nThe special guest stars disc jockey [[Wolfman Jack]] as the tribal chief.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.A.

The ''Einsatzgruppen'' were involved in the murder of much of the [[intelligentsia]], including members of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|priesthood]]{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=4}} and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"[[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]]\" (''Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage'') in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet [[political commissar]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Romani people]] as well as actual or alleged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the supervision of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated in territories occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' worked hand-in-hand with the [[Order Police battalions]] on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the [[Rumbula massacre]] (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], the Wehrmacht cooperated with the ''Einsatzgruppen'', providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'', related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] in 1947\u201348, charged with [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.\n\n== Formation and Aktion T4 ==\nThe ''Einsatzgruppen'' were formed under the direction of SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and operated by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Edeiken|2000}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' had their origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in [[Austria]] in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Originally part of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police; SiPo), two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary due to the [[Munich Agreement]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=405, 412}} From September 1939, the ''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA) had overall command of the ''Einsatzgruppen''.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial, Vol. 20, Day 194}}\n\nAs part of the drive by the Nazi regime to remove so-called \"undesirable\" elements from the German population, from September to December 1939 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and others took part in [[Action T4]], a program of systematic murder of persons with physical and mental disabilities and patients of psychiatric hospitals. Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the killings continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and others, but [[gas chamber]]s were put into use by spring 1940.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=138\u2013141}}\n\n== Invasion of Poland ==\n{{main|Intelligenzaktion|Operation Tannenberg}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1968-034-19A, Exekution von polnischen Geiseln.jpg|thumb|Execution of Poles in [[K\u00f3rnik]], 20 October 1939]]\n[[File:Palmiry ostatnia droga.jpeg|thumb|Polish women led to mass execution in a forest near [[Palmiry massacre|Palmiry]]]]\nIn response to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plan to [[invasion of Poland|invade Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Heydrich re-formed the ''Einsatzgruppen'' to travel in the wake of the German armies.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=425}} Membership at this point was drawn from the SS, the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (Security Service; SD), the police, and the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=11}} Heydrich placed SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Werner Best]] in command, who assigned {{ill|Hans-Joachim Tesmer|de}} to choose personnel for the task forces and their subgroups, called ''[[Einsatzkommando]]s'', from among educated people with military experience and a strong ideological commitment to Nazism.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|pp=11, 20}} Some had previously been members of paramilitary groups such as the ''[[Freikorps]]''.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=17}} Heydrich instructed Wagner in meetings in late July that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' should undertake their operations in cooperation with the ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Order Police; Orpo) and military commanders in the area.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=14}} Army intelligence was in constant contact with ''Einsatzgruppen'' to coordinate their activities with other units.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=17}}\n\nInitially numbering 2,700 men (and ultimately 4,250 in Poland),{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=12}} the ''Einsatzgruppen''{{'}}s mission was to kill members of the Polish leadership most clearly identified with Polish national identity: the intelligentsia, [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|members of the clergy]], teachers, and members of the nobility.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Browning|Matth\u00e4us|2004|pp=16\u201318}} As stated by Hitler: \"...&nbsp;there must be no Polish leaders; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed, however harsh that sounds\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=143}} SS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Lothar Beutel]], commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' IV, later testified that Heydrich gave the order for these killings at a series of meetings in mid-August.{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=15}} The ''[[Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen]]'' \u2014 lists of people to be killed \u2014 had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939, using dossiers collected by the SD from 1936 forward.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Rossino|2003|p=16}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' performed these murders with the support of the ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'', a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=144\u2013145}} Members of the SS, the [[Wehrmacht]], and the ''Ordnungspolizei'' also shot civilians during the Polish campaign.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=429}} Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939.

Since the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1905]], the [[Kresy|''Kresy Wschodnie'']] and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=73}} The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n[[File:Liepaja December 1941 massacres 01.jpeg|thumb|[[Liep\u0101ja massacres]] in Latvia, December 1941]]\nHistorian Erich Haberer notes that many survived and made sense of the \"totalitarian atomization\" of society by seeking conformity with communism.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=76}} As a result, by the time of the German invasion in 1941, many had come to see conformity with a totalitarian regime as socially acceptable behaviour; thus, people simply transferred their allegiance to the German regime when it arrived.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=76}} Some who had collaborated with the Soviet regime sought to divert attention from themselves by naming Jews as collaborators and killing them.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=77}}\n\n[[File:Einsatzgruppen SD issued and used dog-tag.jpg|thumb|Dog tag issued by Einsatzgruppen SD]]\n\n=== Rumbula ===\n{{main|Rumbula massacre}}\n\nIn November 1941 Himmler was dissatisfied with the pace of the exterminations in Latvia, as he intended to move Jews from Germany into the area. He assigned SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' Jeckeln, one of the perpetrators of the Babi Yar massacre, to liquidate the [[Riga ghetto]]. Jeckeln selected a site about {{convert|10|km}} southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station, and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims. Jeckeln organised around 1,700 men, including 300 members of the ''Arajs Kommando'', 50 German SD men, and 50 Latvian guards, most of whom had already participated in mass killings of civilians. These troops were supplemented by Latvians, including members of the Riga city police, battalion police, and ghetto guards. Around 1,500 able-bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced-off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto, where they were put to work mending uniforms.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\nAlthough Rumbula was on the rail line, Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground. Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly. The victims were told that they were being relocated, and were advised to bring up to {{convert|20|kg}} of possessions. The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00&nbsp;am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men went up and down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=208\u2013210}}\n\nWhen the columns neared the prepared execution site, the victims were driven some {{convert|270|m|yd}} from the road into the forest, where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=210\u2013214}}\n\n== Second sweep ==\n''Einsatzgruppe B, C'', and ''D'' did not immediately follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' commanders, with the exception of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} An ''Einsatzgruppe'' report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=549}} Thus, an interval passed between the first round of ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=342\u2013343}} During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}}\n\n''Einsatzgruppe'' A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist ''Einsatzgruppe'' B. In [[Dnepropetrovsk]] in February 1942, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reduced the city's Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=372}} The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=78}}\n\nThe second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=353\u2013354}}\n\n== Transition to gassing ==\n{{see also|Final Solution}}\n\n[[File:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Magirus-Deutz]] van found near [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]] is the same type as those used as [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s. ]]\nAfter a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=197}} Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=52, 124, 168}} As much as possible, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=199\u2014200}} Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=163}} A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' D, SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Ohlendorf]], particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[Minsk]] in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an ''Einsatzgruppen'' mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=547\u2013548}} By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}} He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=551}} Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main ''Einsatzgruppen'' from 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=548}} However, the gas vans were not popular with the ''Einsatzkommandos'', because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=243}} Some of the early mass killings at [[extermination camp]]s used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at [[Auschwitz]] using [[Zyklon B]], a cyanide-based pesticide gas.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nPlans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe\u2014eleven million people\u2014were formalised at the [[Wannsee Conference]], held on 20 January 1942. Some would be [[Extermination through labor|worked to death]], and the rest would be killed in the implementation of the [[Final Solution]] of the [[Jewish question]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage}}).{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=555\u2013556}} Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz, [[Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], [[Treblinka]], and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass killing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=279\u2013280}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' remained active, however, and were put to work fighting partisans, particularly in Belarus.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=248}}\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Stalingrad|fall of Stalingrad]] in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of a special task force, [[Sonderaktion 1005|''Sonderkommando'' 1005]], under SS-''Standartenf\u00fchrer'' [[Paul Blobel]]. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]] to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=258\u2013260, 262}}\n\nBy 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the ''Einsatzgruppen'' retreated alongside the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}\n\n== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==\nAccording to research by German historians [[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]] and {{ill|Martin C\u00fcppers|de|}}, [[Einsatzgruppe Egypt|''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt]], led by [[Walter Rauff]], was raised in 1942 in [[Athens]].

Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=226, 250, 376}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Functionalism versus intentionalism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Myth of the clean Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Porajmos]]\n* [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite news | last1 = Benishay | first1 = Guitel | title = Le journal de bord du chef SS en Tunisie d\u00e9couvert | url = http://www.lphinfo.com/le-journal-de-bord-du-chef-ss-en-tunisie-decouvert/ | work = LPH info | date = 3 May 2016 | accessdate = 18 April 2020 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Browning | first1 = Christopher | author-link = Christopher Browning | last2 = Matth\u00e4us | first2 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink2 = J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us | title = The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 \u2013 March 1942 | series = Comprehensive History of the Holocaust | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8032-1327-2 | ref = harv | url = https://archive.org/details/originsoffinalso00brow }}\n* {{cite news | last1 = Cohen | first1 = Nir | title = Inside the diary of SS officer known as gas chamber 'mastermind' | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4647858,00.html | accessdate = 18 April 2020  | work = Ynetnews | date = 17 April 2015 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Conze | first1 = Eckart | last2 = Frei | first2 = Norbert | last3 = Hayes | first3 = Peter | last4 = Zimmermann | first4 = Moshe | title = Das Amt und die Vergangenheit : deutsche Diplomaten im Dritten Reich und in der Bundesrepublik | year = 2010 | publisher = Karl Blessing | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 978-3-89667-430-2 | ref = {{sfnRef|Conze, Frei et al.|2010}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Craig | first = William | authorlink = William Craig (author) | title = Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad | year = 1973 | publisher = Konecky & Konecky | location = Old Saybrook, CT | isbn = 978-1-56852-368-2 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Crowe | first = David | title = Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the True Story Behind the List | year = 2007 | origyear = 2004 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-00253-5 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dams | first1 = Carsten | last2 = Stolle | first2 = Michael | title = Die Gestapo: Herrschaft und Terror im Dritten Reich | series = Becksche Reihe | year = 2012 | origyear = 2008 | language = German | publisher = Beck | location = Munich | isbn = 978-3-406-62898-6 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = 22 August 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | accessdate= 10 June 2018 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007085553/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | archive-date = 7 October 2015}}\n* {{cite book | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10 | location = N\u00fcrnberg | date = October 1946 \u2013 April 1949 | volume =Volume 4 | series = Green Series | chapter = Einsatzgruppen case | chapter-url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-IV.pdf | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 June 2018 | ref = {{sfnRef|Einsatzgruppen judgment}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

The ''Einsatzgruppen'' were involved in the murder of much of the [[intelligentsia]], including members of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|priesthood]]{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=4}} and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"[[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]]\" (''Die Endl\u00f6sung der Judenfrage'') in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet [[political commissar]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[Romani people]] as well as actual or alleged [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nUnder the direction of ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and the supervision of SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the ''Einsatzgruppen'' operated in territories occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) following the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941. The ''Einsatzgruppen'' worked hand-in-hand with the [[Order Police battalions]] on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the [[Rumbula massacre]] (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], the Wehrmacht cooperated with the ''Einsatzgruppen'', providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. Historian [[Raul Hilberg]] estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'', related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were prosecuted in the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] in 1947\u201348, charged with [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.\n\n== Formation and Aktion T4 ==\nThe ''Einsatzgruppen'' were formed under the direction of SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and operated by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) before and during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Edeiken|2000}} The ''Einsatzgruppen'' had their origins in the ad hoc ''Einsatzkommando'' formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the ''[[Anschluss]]'' in [[Austria]] in March 1938.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=436}} Originally part of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (Security Police; SiPo), two units of ''Einsatzgruppen'' were stationed in the [[Sudetenland]] in October 1938.

Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the killings continued until the end of the war.

He assigned SS-''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' Jeckeln, one of the perpetrators of the Babi Yar massacre, to liquidate the [[Riga ghetto]]. Jeckeln selected a site about {{convert|10|km}} southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station, and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims. Jeckeln organised around 1,700 men, including 300 members of the ''Arajs Kommando'', 50 German SD men, and 50 Latvian guards, most of whom had already participated in mass killings of civilians. These troops were supplemented by Latvians, including members of the Riga city police, battalion police, and ghetto guards. Around 1,500 able-bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced-off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto, where they were put to work mending uniforms.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=206\u2013209}}\n\nAlthough Rumbula was on the rail line, Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground. Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly. The victims were told that they were being relocated, and were advised to bring up to {{convert|20|kg}} of possessions. The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00&nbsp;am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men went up and down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=208\u2013210}}\n\nWhen the columns neared the prepared execution site, the victims were driven some {{convert|270|m|yd}} from the road into the forest, where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=210\u2013214}}\n\n== Second sweep ==\n''Einsatzgruppe B, C'', and ''D'' did not immediately follow ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The ''Einsatzgruppe'' commanders, with the exception of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} An ''Einsatzgruppe'' report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=342}} Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=549}} Thus, an interval passed between the first round of ''Einsatzgruppen'' massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian [[Raul Hilberg]] called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|pp=342\u2013343}} During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=64}}\n\n''Einsatzgruppe'' A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist ''Einsatzgruppe'' B. In [[Dnepropetrovsk]] in February 1942, ''Einsatzgruppe'' D reduced the city's Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=372}} The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have killed so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were killed by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=78}}\n\nThe second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=353\u2013354}}\n\n== Transition to gassing ==\n{{see also|Final Solution}}\n\n[[File:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Magirus-Deutz]] van found near [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp]] is the same type as those used as [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s. ]]\nAfter a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=197}} Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=52, 124, 168}} As much as possible, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=199\u2014200}} Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=163}} A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' D, SS-''Gruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Otto Ohlendorf]], particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nDuring a visit to [[Minsk]] in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an ''Einsatzgruppen'' mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=547\u2013548}} By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}} He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=167}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=551}} Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main ''Einsatzgruppen'' from 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=548}} However, the gas vans were not popular with the ''Einsatzkommandos'', because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=243}} Some of the early mass killings at [[extermination camp]]s used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at [[Auschwitz]] using [[Zyklon B]], a cyanide-based pesticide gas.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\nPlans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe\u2014eleven million people\u2014were formalised at the [[Wannsee Conference]], held on 20 January 1942.

The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves all along the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern Front]] to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=258\u2013260, 262}}\n\nBy 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the ''Einsatzgruppen'' retreated alongside the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most ''Einsatzgruppen'' personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=257}} The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}}\n\n== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==\nAccording to research by German historians [[Klaus-Michael Mallmann]] and {{ill|Martin C\u00fcppers|de|}}, [[Einsatzgruppe Egypt|''Einsatzgruppe'' Egypt]], led by [[Walter Rauff]], was raised in 1942 in [[Athens]].

Four additional ''Einsatzgruppe'' leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J08517, Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto Ohlendorf]], 1943]]\n\nSeveral ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders, including Ohlendorf, claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=187}} To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=187\u2013189}} German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders as ''accomplices'' to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as ''perpetrators'' of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.{{sfn|Streim|1989|p=439}}\n\nStreim postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf's defence. This theory is now widely accepted by historians.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=188}} Longerich notes that most orders received by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders\u2014especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities\u2014were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be \"severe\" and \"firm\"; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=189\u2013190}} British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argues that Hitler's apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to \"annihilate\" the forces of \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" were interpreted by ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence, with each ''Einsatzgruppen'' commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nMost of the perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former ''Einsatzgruppe'' members with war crimes.{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|pp=275\u2013276}} And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.{{sfn|Segev|2010|pp=226, 250, 376}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Functionalism versus intentionalism]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Myth of the clean Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Porajmos]]\n* [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite news | last1 = Benishay | first1 = Guitel | title = Le journal de bord du chef SS en Tunisie d\u00e9couvert | url = http://www.lphinfo.com/le-journal-de-bord-du-chef-ss-en-tunisie-decouvert/ | work = LPH info | date = 3 May 2016 | accessdate = 18 April 2020 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Browning | first = Christopher R. | title = Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland | publisher = Penguin | location = London; New York | orig-year = 1992 | year = 1998 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Browning | first1 = Christopher | author-link = Christopher Browning | last2 = Matth\u00e4us | first2 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink2 = J\u00fcrgen Matth\u00e4us | title = The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 \u2013 March 1942 | series = Comprehensive History of the Holocaust | publisher = University of Nebraska Press | location = Lincoln | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8032-1327-2 | ref = harv | url = https://archive.org/details/originsoffinalso00brow }}\n* {{cite news | last1 = Cohen | first1 = Nir | title = Inside the diary of SS officer known as gas chamber 'mastermind' | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4647858,00.html | accessdate = 18 April 2020  | work = Ynetnews | date = 17 April 2015 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Conze | first1 = Eckart | last2 = Frei | first2 = Norbert | last3 = Hayes | first3 = Peter | last4 = Zimmermann | first4 = Moshe | title = Das Amt und die Vergangenheit : deutsche Diplomaten im Dritten Reich und in der Bundesrepublik | year = 2010 | publisher = Karl Blessing | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 978-3-89667-430-2 | ref = {{sfnRef|Conze, Frei et al.|2010}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Craig | first = William | authorlink = William Craig (author) | title = Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad | year = 1973 | publisher = Konecky & Konecky | location = Old Saybrook, CT | isbn = 978-1-56852-368-2 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Crowe | first = David | title = Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of his Life, Wartime Activities and the True Story Behind the List | year = 2007 | origyear = 2004 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-00253-5 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Dams | first1 = Carsten | last2 = Stolle | first2 = Michael | title = Die Gestapo: Herrschaft und Terror im Dritten Reich | series = Becksche Reihe | year = 2012 | origyear = 2008 | language = German | publisher = Beck | location = Munich | isbn = 978-3-406-62898-6 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Edeiken | first = Yale F. | publisher = Holocaust History Project | title = Introduction to the Einsatzgruppen | date = 22 August 2000 | url = http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | accessdate= 10 June 2018 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151007085553/http://www.holocaust-history.org/intro-einsatz/ | archive-date = 7 October 2015}}\n* {{cite book | title = Trials of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10 | location = N\u00fcrnberg | date = October 1946 \u2013 April 1949 | volume =Volume 4 | series = Green Series | chapter = Einsatzgruppen case | chapter-url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_war-criminals_Vol-IV.pdf | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NTs_war-criminals.html | format = PDF | accessdate = 10 June 2018 | ref = {{sfnRef|Einsatzgruppen judgment}} }}\n* {{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J.

Built by [[Siemens]] and introduced in 1999, it currently serves the [[Bannan line]].\n\n==History==\nSiemens won a contract to build the second batch of 216 cars for the Taipei Metro in 1993. Siemens in turn subcontracted part of the contract to [[Union Carriage & Wagon]] of [[South Africa]], which became a focal point of controversy for the Union Rail Car partnership (the builder of the earlier [[Taipei Metro C301|C301]] trains) and the United States government, the latter which accused the South African government of subsidising the Siemens bid; Union Carriage & Wagon in return denied any government involvement in the bid. The United States government sought to convince Taipei to reverse the contract award to Siemens but was presumably unsuccessful.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/nyregion/yonkers-fighting-to-save-rail-car-jobs.html Yonkers Fighting To Save Rail-Car Jobs], [[The New York Times]], Elsa Brenner, 25 July 1993</ref>\n\n==Exterior==\nThe train design was based on the [[Siemens Modular Metro|Modular Metro]], while the exterior and interior dimensions and configurations are the same as the [[Taipei Metro C301|C301]]. However, a key distinguishing feature of the C321 is the use of a white flat [[fiber-reinforced plastic|FRP]] front as opposed to the grey rounded front of the C301. The general shape of the C321 can also be described as more squarish than the C301 trains.<ref name=fgu>{{cite web|url=http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~94411002/TiapeiMrtSimple/05.htm|title= \u7b2c\u4e94\u7ae0\u3000\u6377\u904b\u5217\u8eca\u4ecb\u7d39|website=fgu.edu.tw}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Siemens C651|Singapore MRT C651]] bears a similar design to the C321 and like the C321, was also built by Siemens.\n\n==Interior==\nA significant change of the C321 interior design as compared to the C301 was the ceiling design, where the air-conditioning vents were more exposed and demarcated with blue stripes while the ceiling at each end of the car was lowered to accommodate space for the air-conditioning evaporator.<ref name=pierre2427>{{cite web|url=http://2427junction.com/taiwantaipeic321.html|title=\u53f0\u5317\u6377\u904b\u8eca\u4e21\u7d39\u4ecb321\u578b|website=2427junction.com}}</ref> Likewise, the grab pole configuration was also significantly different from the C301 as it was now two side handrails instead of a single central handrail.\n\nLike the C301, the seats are arranged in a mix of transverse and longitudinal arrangements. Most seats are turquoise, while the priority seats are navy blue. The priority seats are at the sides, and 8 seats are between doors, while 3 seats are next to the end of the car and doors.\n\nAs with the C301 trains, the Passenger Information Display did not show the doors opening and closing or the time prior to the refurbishment of the sets. Before the refurbishment, it showed the station design and the terminal. Bicycle racks are available at the end cars.\n\n==Deployments==\nThe C321 was built in a few different batches: CC361 (8 trainsets) for the [[Zhonghe-Xinlu line|Zhonghe line]], CH321 (11 trainsets) for the [[Songshan-Xindian line|Xindian line]] and CN331 (17 trainsets) for the [[Bannan line|Nangang line]].\n\nWhen initially introduced, the trains initially served the [[Tamsui\u2013Xinyi line|Tamsui]], [[Songshan-Xindian line|Xindian, Xiaonanmen]], [[Zhonghe-Xinlu line|Zhonghe]], [[Bannan line|Banqiao, and Nangang lines]] and the [[Xiaobitan branch line]]. In the case of the [[Xiaobitan branch line]] [[selective door operation]] had to be used and one half of the trainset used had to be sealed off from public. The C321 was withdrawn from the Xiaobitan branch line on 21 July 2006 with the introduction of a three-car [[Taipei Metro C371|C371]] trainset; on 4 March 2009 almost all C321 trainsets were consolidated to the Bannan Line to facilitate the maintenance regime and [[train dispatcher|train dispatching]]. Use of the C321 on the Xiaonanmen Line was also discontinued in 2012.<ref name=fgu /><ref name=pierre2427 />\n\n==Train formation==\n[[File:Siemens logo in Taipei MRT 2140.jpg|thumb|left|A Siemens builder's plate and a fleet number plate on a C321 train.

Hence, DM1 cars use the number x=1, T cars x=2, and M2 cars x=3\n* The other three digits are the identification number of the train the car is part of. A full-length train of six cars consists of two identification numbers, one for the first three cars, and another for the second three. The bigger number is always equal to the smaller number plus one, and the smaller number is always an odd number.

He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies, but which is seen in recent decades as being deeply problematic.\n\n==Biography==\nJames Milne, later known as James Mill, was born in Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, [[Angus, Scotland]], the son of James Milne, a [[shoemaker]] and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the [[Jacobite risings|Stuart rising]]{{which|date=January 2018}}, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the [[Montrose Academy]], where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\nIn October 1789, he was ordained as a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], but met with little success. According to John Stuart Mill's ''Autobiography'', his father though \"educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion.\"<ref>https://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/mill/auto/auto.c02.html</ref> From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, England, in company with [[Sir John Stuart, 4th Baronet|Sir John Stuart]] of [[Fettercairn]], then member of parliament for [[Kincardineshire]], and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the ''Literary Journal'', which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the ''St James's Chronicle'', belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of ''An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther'', a [[Charles de Villers|C.F. Villers]]'s work  on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year he began his ''[[The History of British India]]'', which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\nIn that year he also married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in [[Hoxton]]. He then took a house in [[Pentonville]], where his eldest son, [[John Stuart Mill]], was born in 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of No. 19, York Street (1848).

Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to [[Jeremy Bentham]], was occupied successively by James Mill and [[William Hazlitt]], and finally demolished in 1877.{{sfn|Stephen|1894|p=32}}]]\nIn 1808, he became acquainted with [[Jeremy Bentham]], and was for many years his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'', the ''British Review'' and ''[[The Eclectic Review]]''; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the [[Edinburgh Review]], to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being \"Money and Exchange.\" He also wrote on Spanish America, China, [[Francisco de Miranda]], the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and the Liberty of the Press. In the ''Annual Review'' for 1808 two articles of his are traced\u2014a \"Review of Fox's History\", and an article on \"Bentham's Law Reforms\", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] (1770\u20131843), a [[Quaker]] and [[chemist]], in a periodical called the ''Philanthropist''. He contributed largely to every issue \u2013 his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's [[Panopticon]]). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the [[Monitorial System|Bell and Lancaster]] controversy, and took a  part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the [[University of London]] in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of [[utilitarianism]], for the supplement to the fifth edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the most important being those on \"Jurisprudence\", \"Prisons\", \"Government\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} and \"Law of Nations\".\n\nIn 1818, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published, and obtained a great and immediate success.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1817 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= The History of British India |volume= |edition=1 |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1817 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish1817mill#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}</ref> It brought about a change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in ranks until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of \u00a31900, raised in 1836 to \u00a32000. His great work, the ''Elements of Political Economy'', appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1821 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Elements of Political Economy |volume= |edition=First |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1821 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementsofpoliti00millrich#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed to the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', started as the organ of his party, a number of articles in which he attacked the ''[[Edinburgh Review|Edinburgh]]'' and ''[[Quarterly Review|Quarterly]]'' Reviews and ecclesiastical establishments. In 1829 appeared the ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind''. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of directors. For the ''[[Westminster Review#London and Westminster Review|London Review]]'', founded by [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]] in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled \"The Church and its Reform\", which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the ''Review''. Mill, himself was an atheist.<ref>https://mises.org/library/james-mill-laissez-faires-lenin</ref> His last published book was the ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' (1835).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n==Intellectual legacy==\n\n===''The History of British India''===\n\n===British politics===\nMill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called \"[[Philosophical Radicals|philosophic radicalism]]\". His writings on government and his personal influence among the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians of his time determined the change of view from the [[French Revolution]] theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the [[Reform Bill]] was fought and won. His ''Elements of Political Economy'' followed up the views of his friend [[David Ricardo]]. By 1911, the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] described it as being of mainly historical interest, \"an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Among the more important of its theses are:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n# that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. \u00a7 2, art. 3)\n# that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and\n# that what is now known as the \"[[unearned increment]]\" of land is a proper object for taxation.\n\n===Other areas===\nBy his ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' and his ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as then represented by [[Thomas Reid]], [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], but made a new start, due in part to [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the ''Analysis'' is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on [[Franz Brentano]] who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology.<ref>Franz Brentano: ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt''. Ed. Oskar Kraus, 2 vols. Leipzig: Meiner, 1924\u201325; ed. Mauro Antonelli. Heusenstamm: Ontos, 2008</ref> The ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir [[James Mackintosh]]'s ''Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy'' (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4543}}\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Mill - Elements of political economy, 1826 - 5894644.tif|thumb|''Elements of political economy'', 1826]]\n[[File:Bain - James Mill, 1882 - 5825460.tif|thumb|[[Alexander Bain]], ''James Mill.

He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies, but which is seen in recent decades as being deeply problematic.\n\n==Biography==\nJames Milne, later known as James Mill, was born in Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, [[Angus, Scotland]], the son of James Milne, a [[shoemaker]] and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the [[Jacobite risings|Stuart rising]]{{which|date=January 2018}}, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the [[Montrose Academy]], where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\nIn October 1789, he was ordained as a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], but met with little success. According to John Stuart Mill's ''Autobiography'', his father though \"educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion.\"<ref>https://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/mill/auto/auto.c02.html</ref> From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, England, in company with [[Sir John Stuart, 4th Baronet|Sir John Stuart]] of [[Fettercairn]], then member of parliament for [[Kincardineshire]], and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the ''Literary Journal'', which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the ''St James's Chronicle'', belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of ''An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther'', a [[Charles de Villers|C.F. Villers]]'s work  on the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year he began his ''[[The History of British India]]'', which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\nIn that year he also married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in [[Hoxton]]. He then took a house in [[Pentonville]], where his eldest son, [[John Stuart Mill]], was born in 1806.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of No. 19, York Street (1848).

Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to [[Jeremy Bentham]], was occupied successively by James Mill and [[William Hazlitt]], and finally demolished in 1877.{{sfn|Stephen|1894|p=32}}]]\nIn 1808, he became acquainted with [[Jeremy Bentham]], and was for many years his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'', the ''British Review'' and ''[[The Eclectic Review]]''; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the [[Edinburgh Review]], to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being \"Money and Exchange.\" He also wrote on Spanish America, China, [[Francisco de Miranda]], the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], and the Liberty of the Press. In the ''Annual Review'' for 1808 two articles of his are traced\u2014a \"Review of Fox's History\", and an article on \"Bentham's Law Reforms\", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] (1770\u20131843), a [[Quaker]] and [[chemist]], in a periodical called the ''Philanthropist''. He contributed largely to every issue \u2013 his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's [[Panopticon]]). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the [[Monitorial System|Bell and Lancaster]] controversy, and took a  part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the [[University of London]] in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of [[utilitarianism]], for the supplement to the fifth edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the most important being those on \"Jurisprudence\", \"Prisons\", \"Government\"{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} and \"Law of Nations\".\n\nIn 1818, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published, and obtained a great and immediate success.<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1817 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= The History of British India |volume= |edition=1 |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1817 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish1817mill#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}</ref> It brought about a change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in ranks until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of \u00a31900, raised in 1836 to \u00a32000. His great work, the ''Elements of Political Economy'', appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Mill |first=James |year=1821 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title= Elements of Political Economy |volume= |edition=First |publisher= Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |publication-date=1821 |publication-place=London |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementsofpoliti00millrich#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=11 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed to the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', started as the organ of his party, a number of articles in which he attacked the ''[[Edinburgh Review|Edinburgh]]'' and ''[[Quarterly Review|Quarterly]]'' Reviews and ecclesiastical establishments. In 1829 appeared the ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind''. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of directors. For the ''[[Westminster Review#London and Westminster Review|London Review]]'', founded by [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|Sir William Molesworth]] in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled \"The Church and its Reform\", which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the ''Review''. Mill, himself was an atheist.<ref>https://mises.org/library/james-mill-laissez-faires-lenin</ref> His last published book was the ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' (1835).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n\n==Intellectual legacy==\n\n===''The History of British India''===\n{{Main|The History of British India}}\n\nMill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the [[Empiricism|empirical]] one common at the time. His best known literary work is his ''History of British India'', in which he describes the acquisition of the [[British India|Indian Empire]] by England and later the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's ''History of India'' by notable economist [[Amartya Sen]].<ref>[[Amartya Sen]]'s address given to the Millennium Session of the Indian History Congress [https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/458/history-and-the-enterprise-of-knowledge]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Trautmann]], \"James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) \u2013 most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters&nbsp;\u2013 is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Aryans and British India |pages=117 |first=Thomas R. |last=Trautmann |location=New Delhi |publisher=YODA Press |edition=2nd Indian |year=2006 |origyear=1997 |isbn=81-902272-1-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR_LPnEH3GsC&pg=PA117}}</ref> In the chapter titled General Reflections in \"Of the Hindus\", Mill wrote \"under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of British India |first= James |last=Mill |publisher = Madden |year=1858 |url=https://archive.org/details/historybritishi24wilsgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historybritishi24wilsgoog/page/n170 150] }}</ref> According to Mill, \"the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality\" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and \"in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave\". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were \"dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society\". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were \"disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves\". Both were \"cowardly and unfeeling\". Both were \"in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others\". And, above all, both were \"in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses\".<ref>Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree.</ref>\n\n===British politics===\nMill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called \"[[Philosophical Radicals|philosophic radicalism]]\". His writings on government and his personal influence among the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politicians of his time determined the change of view from the [[French Revolution]] theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the [[Reform Bill]] was fought and won. His ''Elements of Political Economy'' followed up the views of his friend [[David Ricardo]]. By 1911, the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] described it as being of mainly historical interest, \"an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}} Among the more important of its theses are:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=453}}\n# that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. \u00a7 2, art. 3)\n# that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and\n# that what is now known as the \"[[unearned increment]]\" of land is a proper object for taxation.\n\n===Other areas===\nBy his ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' and his ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], as then represented by [[Thomas Reid]], [[Dugald Stewart]] and [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], but made a new start, due in part to [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the ''Analysis'' is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on [[Franz Brentano]] who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology.<ref>Franz Brentano: ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt''. Ed. Oskar Kraus, 2 vols. Leipzig: Meiner, 1924\u201325; ed. Mauro Antonelli. Heusenstamm: Ontos, 2008</ref> The ''Fragment on Mackintosh'' severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir [[James Mackintosh]]'s ''Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy'' (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=4543}}\n\n==Major works==\n[[File:Mill - Elements of political economy, 1826 - 5894644.tif|thumb|''Elements of political economy'', 1826]]\n[[File:Bain - James Mill, 1882 - 5825460.tif|thumb|[[Alexander Bain]], ''James Mill.

The Aten was the disc of the sun and originally an aspect of [[Ra]], the sun god in traditional [[ancient Egyptian religion]], but Akhenaten made it the sole focus of official worship during his reign.\n\nIn his poem \"[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a creation myth or family but is mentioned in the [[Book of the Dead]]. The worship of Aten was eradicated by [[Horemheb]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{stack begin|float=left}}\n[[File: Aten worship - Great Hymn to Aten.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Great Hymn to Aten\" written as if Akhenaten is the one speaking but it is arguable whether he wrote it himself or not.]]\n{{stack end}}\n[[Image:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.)

(2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt.''

Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature,'' Vol. 1, 1980, p. 223</ref> By analogy, the term \"silver aten\" was sometimes used to refer to the moon.<ref>Fleming, Fergus, and Alan Lothian (1997). ''The Way to Eternity: Egyptian Myth.'' Duncan Baird Publishers. p. 52</ref> The solar Aten was extensively worshipped as a god in the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] when it was depicted as a falcon-headed man much like [[Ra]]. In the reign of Amenhotep III's successor, Amenhotep IV, the Aten became the central god of the Egyptian state religion, and Amenhotep IV changed his name to [[Akhenaten]] to reflect his close link with the new supreme deity.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 2003\"/>\n\nThe full title of Akhenaten's god was \"[[Ra-Horakhty]] who rejoices in the horizon, in his Name as the Light which is in the sun disc.\" (This is the title of the god as it appears on the numerous [[stelae]] placed to mark the boundaries of Akhenaten's new capital at [[Akhetaten]], modern [[Amarna]].)\nThis lengthy name was often shortened to ''Ra-Horus-Aten'' or just ''Aten'' in many texts, but the god of Akhenaten raised to supremacy is considered a [[Syncretism|synthesis]] of very ancient gods viewed in a new and different way. The god is also considered to be both masculine and feminine simultaneously. All creation was thought to emanate from the god and to exist within the god. In particular, the god was not depicted in anthropomorphic (human) form, but as rays of light extending from the sun's disk.\n\nFurthermore, the god's name came to be written within a [[cartouche]], along with the titles normally given to a [[Pharaoh]], another break with ancient tradition. Ra-Horus, more usually referred to as ''Ra-Horakhty'' (''Ra, who is Horus of the two horizons''), is a synthesis of two other gods, both of which are attested from very early on. During the [[Amarna]] period, this synthesis was seen as the invisible source of energy of the sun god, of which the visible manifestation was the Aten, the solar disk. Thus Ra-Horus-Aten was a development of old ideas which came gradually. The real change, as some see it, was the apparent abandonment of all other gods, especially [[Amun]]-[[Ra]], prohibition of idolatry, and the debatable introduction of quasi-[[monotheism]] by Akhenaten.<ref>Jan Assmann, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press 2005, p. 59</ref> The syncretism is readily apparent in the Great Hymn to the Aten in which Re-Herakhty, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and Aten are merged into the creator god.<ref>M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', Vol. 2, 1980, p. 96</ref> Others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],<ref>[[Dominic Montserrat]], ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt,'' Routledge 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-18549-1}}, pp. 36ff.</ref> as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten.

The conditions are the same after death.\n\nThe explanation as to why Aten could not be fully represented was that Aten was beyond creation. Thus the scenes of gods carved in stone previously depicted animals and human forms, now showed Aten as an orb above with life-giving rays stretching toward the royal figure. The king was depicted singularly in relation to divine power.

The principles of Aten's cult were recorded on the rock walls of tombs of Amarna. Significantly different from other ancient Egyptian temples, temples of Aten were open-roofed to allow the rays of the sun. Doorways had broken lintels and raised thresholds. No statues of Aten were allowed; those were seen as idolatry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aten, god of Egypt|url=http://www.landofpyramids.org/aten.htm|publisher=Siteseen Ltd.|date=June 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> However, these were typically replaced by functionally equivalent representations of Akhenaten and his family venerating the Aten and receiving the [[ankh]] (breath of life) from him. Priests had less to do since offerings (fruits, flowers, cakes) were limited, and oracles were not needed.<ref>{{cite web|title=History embalmed: Aten|url=http://www.historyembalmed.org/egyptian-gods/aten.htm|publisher=2014 Siteseen Ltd.|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> Temples of Aten did not collect tax.\n\nElite women were known to worship the Aten in sun-shade temples in Akhetaten.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pasquali|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=A sun-shade temple of Princess Ankhesenpaaten in Memphis?|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|date=2011|volume=97|pages=219|jstor=23269901}}</ref>\n\nIn the worship of Aten, the daily service of purification, anointment, and clothing of the divine image was not performed. Incense was burnt several times a day. Hymns sung to Aten were accompanied by harp music. Aten's ceremonies in Akhetaten involved giving offerings to Aten with a swipe of the royal scepter.\n\nInstead of barque processions, the royal family rode on a chariot on festival days.\n\nAten is an evolution of the idea of a sun god in Egyptian mythology, deriving a lot of his concepts of power and representation from the earlier god Ra but building on top of the power Ra represents. Aten carried absolute power in the universe, representing the life-giving force of light to the world as well as merging with the concept and goddess Maat to develop further responsibilities for Aten beyond the power of light itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pharaohs of the sun : Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen|date=1999|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts in association with Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown and Co|author1=Freed, Rita E.|author2=D'Auria, Sue|author3=Markowitz, Yvonne J.|isbn=978-0878464708|location=Boston|oclc=42450325|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780821226209}}</ref>\n\nAten is depicted caring for the people through Akhenaten by Aten's hands extending towards the royalty, giving them ankhs representing life being given to humanity through both Aten and Akhenaten. In Akhenaten's Hymn to Aten, a love for humanity and the Earth is depicted in Aten's mannerisms:\n\n\"Aten bends low, near the earth, to watch over his creation; he takes his place in the sky for the same purpose; he wearies himself in the service of the creatures; he shines for them all; he gives them sun and sends them rain. The unborn child and the baby chick are cared for; and Akhenaten asks his divine father to 'lift up' the creatures for his sake so that they might aspire to the condition of perfection of his father, Aten\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Akhetaten ==\nFourteen stelae were placed to mark the boundaries of the new city Akhetaten, modern day [[Amarna]]. Each stele was marked with a declaration of the founding of the city as well as a depiction of the royal family worshiping Aten. Akhenaten patrolled the city grounds on a chariot, overseeing the construction of the city and temples for the purpose of honoring their new sole god, Aten. Akhetaten was declared Egypt's new capital during the reign of Akhenaten. The city had a central road called the \"Royal Road\" by modern historians leading to the palace. By building the city all at once, the layout of the city was entirely open to Akhenaten's design with many large structures dedicated to the worship of Aten.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\n== Architecture ==\nAten's temples were unique in architecture compared to other Egyptian temples of the time. Balustrades depicting Akhenaten, the queen and the princess embracing the rays of Aten would flank either side of stairwells, ramps, or altars.  Fragments of these Balustrades were initially identified as [[stele]] but were later decided to be balustrades due to the location they were found and the way the pattern was carved into both faces of the slab.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Ian|date=1994|title=Balustrades, Stairs and Altars in the Cult of the Aten at el-Amarna|jstor=3821854|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=80|pages=109\u2013127|doi=10.2307/3821854}}</ref>\n\nTemples to Aten were open-air structures with little to no roofing to maximize the amount of sunlight on the interior. A slaughter yard and places to grow food were near the temple for preparing sacrifices to Aten.<ref name=\":0\" /> Two temples were central to the city of Akhetaten, the larger of the two had an \"open, unroofed structure covering an area of about {{convert|800 x 300|m|-2}} at the northern end of the city\".<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book |title=The ancient gods speak : a guide to Egyptian religion|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Redford, Donald B.|isbn=978-0195154016|location=Oxford|oclc=49698760}}</ref> Aten, by nature, was everywhere and intangible because he was the sunlight and energy in the world.

After the death of Akhenaten, his son, Tutankhamun, reinstated the cult of Amun and the ban on religions in competition with Atenism was lifted.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Akhenaten and the religion of light|last=Hornung |first=Erik |date=2001 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0801487255 |location=Ithaca, NY |oclc=48417401}}</ref> The point of this transition can be seen in the name change of Tutankh'''aten''' into Tutankh'''amun''' indicating the loss of favor in the worship of Aten.<ref name=\":0\" /> With the death of Akhenaten, the city of Amarna was abandoned, along with the worship of Aten. There is evidence that the people under Akhetaten's rule did not directly worship Aten, but \"Worshiped the king and queen worshiping the disc\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The cult of Aten was still in Egypt for another ten years or so as it faded and there was no purge of the cult after Akhenaten's death. When Tutankhamun came into power, his religious reign was one of tolerance, the only difference was that Aten was no longer the only god.<ref name=\":13\" /> Tutankhamun rebuilt the temples that were destroyed during Akhenaten's reign and he reinstated the old pantheon of gods. This return to the gods that were before Aten was \"a move based publicly on the doctrine that Egypt's woes stemmed directly from its ignoring the gods, and in turn the gods' abandonment of Egypt\".<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==Royal Titulary==\n[[File:Stela of the Great temple of Aten at Akhetaten2008.jpg|thumb|Stela of the Great temple of the Aten showing the early form the Aten's names.]]\n\nDuring the Amarna Period, the Aten was given a Royal Titulary (as he was considered to be king of all), with his names drawn in a [[cartouche]].

The Aten was the disc of the sun and originally an aspect of [[Ra]], the sun god in traditional [[ancient Egyptian religion]], but Akhenaten made it the sole focus of official worship during his reign.\n\nIn his poem \"[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]\", Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, giver of life, and nurturing spirit of the world. Aten does not have a creation myth or family but is mentioned in the [[Book of the Dead]]. The worship of Aten was eradicated by [[Horemheb]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{stack begin|float=left}}\n[[File: Aten worship - Great Hymn to Aten.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Great Hymn to Aten\" written as if Akhenaten is the one speaking but it is arguable whether he wrote it himself or not.]]\n{{stack end}}\n[[Image:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.)

(2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt.''

Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature,'' Vol. 1, 1980, p. 223</ref> By analogy, the term \"silver aten\" was sometimes used to refer to the moon.<ref>Fleming, Fergus, and Alan Lothian (1997). ''The Way to Eternity: Egyptian Myth.'' Duncan Baird Publishers. p. 52</ref> The solar Aten was extensively worshipped as a god in the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] when it was depicted as a falcon-headed man much like [[Ra]]. In the reign of Amenhotep III's successor, Amenhotep IV, the Aten became the central god of the Egyptian state religion, and Amenhotep IV changed his name to [[Akhenaten]] to reflect his close link with the new supreme deity.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 2003\"/>\n\nThe full title of Akhenaten's god was \"[[Ra-Horakhty]] who rejoices in the horizon, in his Name as the Light which is in the sun disc.\" (This is the title of the god as it appears on the numerous [[stelae]] placed to mark the boundaries of Akhenaten's new capital at [[Akhetaten]], modern [[Amarna]].)\nThis lengthy name was often shortened to ''Ra-Horus-Aten'' or just ''Aten'' in many texts, but the god of Akhenaten raised to supremacy is considered a [[Syncretism|synthesis]] of very ancient gods viewed in a new and different way. The god is also considered to be both masculine and feminine simultaneously. All creation was thought to emanate from the god and to exist within the god. In particular, the god was not depicted in anthropomorphic (human) form, but as rays of light extending from the sun's disk.\n\nFurthermore, the god's name came to be written within a [[cartouche]], along with the titles normally given to a [[Pharaoh]], another break with ancient tradition. Ra-Horus, more usually referred to as ''Ra-Horakhty'' (''Ra, who is Horus of the two horizons''), is a synthesis of two other gods, both of which are attested from very early on. During the [[Amarna]] period, this synthesis was seen as the invisible source of energy of the sun god, of which the visible manifestation was the Aten, the solar disk. Thus Ra-Horus-Aten was a development of old ideas which came gradually. The real change, as some see it, was the apparent abandonment of all other gods, especially [[Amun]]-[[Ra]], prohibition of idolatry, and the debatable introduction of quasi-[[monotheism]] by Akhenaten.<ref>Jan Assmann, ''Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies'', Stanford University Press 2005, p. 59</ref> The syncretism is readily apparent in the Great Hymn to the Aten in which Re-Herakhty, [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and Aten are merged into the creator god.<ref>M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', Vol. 2, 1980, p. 96</ref> Others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],<ref>[[Dominic Montserrat]], ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt,'' Routledge 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-18549-1}}, pp. 36ff.</ref> as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten.

The conditions are the same after death.\n\nThe explanation as to why Aten could not be fully represented was that Aten was beyond creation. Thus the scenes of gods carved in stone previously depicted animals and human forms, now showed Aten as an orb above with life-giving rays stretching toward the royal figure. The king was depicted singularly in relation to divine power. This power transcended human or animal form.<ref>{{cite book|last=Groenewegen-Frankfort|first=Henriette Antonia|date=1951|title=Arrest and Movement: An Essay on Space and Time in the Representational Art of the Ancient Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdiysCKHbOMC&pg=PA99|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=99|isbn=978-0674046566|author-link=}}</ref>\n\nAkhenaten represented himself not as a god, but as a son of Aten, shifting the previous methods of pharaohs claiming to be the embodiment of Horus.

The principles of Aten's cult were recorded on the rock walls of tombs of Amarna. Significantly different from other ancient Egyptian temples, temples of Aten were open-roofed to allow the rays of the sun. Doorways had broken lintels and raised thresholds. No statues of Aten were allowed; those were seen as idolatry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aten, god of Egypt|url=http://www.landofpyramids.org/aten.htm|publisher=Siteseen Ltd.|date=June 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> However, these were typically replaced by functionally equivalent representations of Akhenaten and his family venerating the Aten and receiving the [[ankh]] (breath of life) from him.

Incense was burnt several times a day. Hymns sung to Aten were accompanied by harp music. Aten's ceremonies in Akhetaten involved giving offerings to Aten with a swipe of the royal scepter.\n\nInstead of barque processions, the royal family rode on a chariot on festival days.\n\nAten is an evolution of the idea of a sun god in Egyptian mythology, deriving a lot of his concepts of power and representation from the earlier god Ra but building on top of the power Ra represents. Aten carried absolute power in the universe, representing the life-giving force of light to the world as well as merging with the concept and goddess Maat to develop further responsibilities for Aten beyond the power of light itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pharaohs of the sun : Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen|date=1999|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts in association with Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown and Co|author1=Freed, Rita E.|author2=D'Auria, Sue|author3=Markowitz, Yvonne J.|isbn=978-0878464708|location=Boston|oclc=42450325|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780821226209}}</ref>\n\nAten is depicted caring for the people through Akhenaten by Aten's hands extending towards the royalty, giving them ankhs representing life being given to humanity through both Aten and Akhenaten. In Akhenaten's Hymn to Aten, a love for humanity and the Earth is depicted in Aten's mannerisms:\n\n\"Aten bends low, near the earth, to watch over his creation; he takes his place in the sky for the same purpose; he wearies himself in the service of the creatures; he shines for them all; he gives them sun and sends them rain. The unborn child and the baby chick are cared for; and Akhenaten asks his divine father to 'lift up' the creatures for his sake so that they might aspire to the condition of perfection of his father, Aten\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Akhetaten ==\nFourteen stelae were placed to mark the boundaries of the new city Akhetaten, modern day [[Amarna]]. Each stele was marked with a declaration of the founding of the city as well as a depiction of the royal family worshiping Aten. Akhenaten patrolled the city grounds on a chariot, overseeing the construction of the city and temples for the purpose of honoring their new sole god, Aten. Akhetaten was declared Egypt's new capital during the reign of Akhenaten. The city had a central road called the \"Royal Road\" by modern historians leading to the palace. By building the city all at once, the layout of the city was entirely open to Akhenaten's design with many large structures dedicated to the worship of Aten.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\n== Architecture ==\nAten's temples were unique in architecture compared to other Egyptian temples of the time. Balustrades depicting Akhenaten, the queen and the princess embracing the rays of Aten would flank either side of stairwells, ramps, or altars.  Fragments of these Balustrades were initially identified as [[stele]] but were later decided to be balustrades due to the location they were found and the way the pattern was carved into both faces of the slab.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Ian|date=1994|title=Balustrades, Stairs and Altars in the Cult of the Aten at el-Amarna|jstor=3821854|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=80|pages=109\u2013127|doi=10.2307/3821854}}</ref>\n\nTemples to Aten were open-air structures with little to no roofing to maximize the amount of sunlight on the interior.

They decide to share a flat to pool their meagre grants and to find a place to practise. They suffer the put-downs of the acerbic Sir Benjamin Boyd, who conducts the student orchestra, and the antics of the other talented but eccentric teachers at the school.\n\nTo raise some much-needed funds, the group offer to play a [[string quintet]] recital, but it's a disaster, with instrument strings breaking all the time.

Sober the next day, he realises that he has violated the terms of his grant; the two offer to sell it back to him for five hundred pounds, money he can't possibly raise. He then learns that the tune is an existing one (which he probably heard somewhere) and copyrighted, so the composer could theoretically sue the purchasers.\n\nSome of the students go up for a prestigious scholarship, which includes conducting a professional orchestra [[Sinfonia of London]]. Mervyn makes a reasonable effort with music by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], but the supercilious know-it-all Harold annoys the musicians with constant criticism and they have their own back on him, with a disastrous rendition of Rossini's ''William Tell Overture''.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the scholarship is awarded to Miranda, but she confesses that she only wants to marry fellow student Mervyn, who likewise is in love with her.  Malcolm is awarded a position in Sir Benjamin's orchestra and proposes to Jill.  Alex leaves school in order to study violin in Amsterdam.\n\n==Trivia==\n* The producers of the film credit the [[Sinfonia of London]] for their assistance.\n\n* The exterior of the music school is filmed at University College London, which also doubled for St Swithin's hospital in several of the 'Doctor' films.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Robertson Justice]] as Sir Benjamin Boyd\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] as Mervyn Hughes\n* [[Paul Massie]] as Malcolm Stewart\n* [[Kenneth Williams]] as Harold Chesney\n* [[Liz Fraser]] as Miranda Kennaway\n* [[Eric Barker]] as Dr. Morgan Rutherford\n* [[Jennifer Jayne]] as Jill Clemons\n* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] as Alex Spendlove\n* [[Sid James]] as Sid\n* [[Esma Cannon]] as Mrs Deevens\n* [[Geoffrey Keen]] as Sir John\n* [[Jill Ireland]] as Janet\n* [[Victor Maddern]] as Removal Man\n* [[Lance Percival]] as Harry\n* [[Joan Hickson]] as Mrs Bostwick\n* [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] as Mrs Featherstone\n* [[Brian Oulton]] as Concert Agent\n* Christine Andres Coombs as Violin player\n* [[Leonard Hirsch]] as Orchestra leader violin\n* [[Jim Dale]] as Cheeky young trombonist\n* Ronald Waller as 1st Bassoon in the final orchestral clip\n* Eddie Wilson (Albert Edward Wilson) as the 2nd Bassoon in the final orchestra clip\n* [[Dorinda Stevens]] as Doris\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0055354|Raising the Wind}}\n\n{{Gerald Thomas}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Gerald Thomas]]\n[[Category:1961 films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1961 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Peter Rogers]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n\n{{1960s-UK-comedy-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Raising the Wind\n| caption        = \n| image\t=\tRaising the Wind FilmPoster.jpeg\n| director       = [[Gerald Thomas]]\n| producer       = [[Peter Rogers]]\n| writer         = [[Bruce Montgomery (composer)|Bruce Montgomery]] \n| starring       = {{nowrap|[[James Robertson Justice]]<br />[[Leslie Phillips]]<br />[[Kenneth Williams]]}}\n| music          = [[Edmund Crispin]]\n| cinematography = [[Alan Hume]]\n| editing        = \n| distributor    = [[Anglo-Amalgamated]]\n| released       = {{Start date|df=yes|1961}}\n| runtime        = 91 minutes\n| country        = United Kingdom\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n| preceded_by    = \n| followed_by    = \n}}\n\n'''''Raising the Wind''''' is a 1961 British [[comedy film]] written by [[Edmund Crispin|Bruce Montgomery]] and directed by [[Gerald Thomas]].
