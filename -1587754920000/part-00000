The items are more easily remembered as a group than as the individual items themselves. These chunks can be highly subjective because they rely on an individuals perceptions and past experiences, that are able to be linked to the information set. The size of the chunks generally range anywhere from two to six items, but often differ based on language and culture.\n\nAccording to Johnson (1970), there are four main concepts associated with the memory process of chunking: chunk, memory code, decode, and recode.<ref>{{Citation|last=Johnson|first=Neal F.|title=The Role of Chunking and Organization in The Process of Recall11The research reported herein was supported through the Cooperative Research Program of the Office of Education, U.

These item or information sets are to be stored in the same memory code. The process of recoding is where one learns the code for a chunk, and decoding is when the code is translated into the information that it represents.\n\nThe phenomenon of chunking as a memory mechanism is easily observed in the way individuals group numbers, and information, in the day-to-day life. For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10 and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a day, month and year. It would be stored as December 10, 1946 instead of a string of numbers. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that is beyond the \"seven plus-or-minus two\" memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=George A.|date=1956|title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/h0043158|journal=Psychological Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=81\u201397|doi=10.1037/h0043158|issn=1939-1471}}</ref>\n\n==Modality Effect==\nA [[modality effect]] is present in chunking. That is, the mechanism used to convey the list of items to the individual affects how much \"chunking\" occurs.\n\nExperimentally, it has been found that auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals than visual presentation does. Previous literature, such as George Miller's [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956)]] has shown that the probability of recall of information is greater when the \"chunking\" strategy is used.<ref name=\":0\" /> As stated above, the grouping of the responses occurs as individuals place them into categories according to their inter-relatedness based on semantic and perceptual properties. Lindley (1966) showed that since the groups produced have meaning to the participant, this strategy makes it easier for an individual to recall and maintain information in memory during studies and testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Richard H.|date=1966-08-01|title=Recoding as a function of chunking and meaningfulness|journal=Psychonomic Science|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=393\u2013394|doi=10.3758/BF03330953|issn=0033-3131|doi-access=free}}</ref> Therefore, when \"chunking\" is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.\n\n==Memory training systems, mnemonic==\nVarious kinds of [[memory]] training systems and [[mnemonics]] include training and drill in specially-designed recoding or chunking schemes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Don R.|date=1977-10-01|title=Individual differences in immediate serial recall: A matter of mnemonics?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028577900147|journal=Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=403\u2013411|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(77)90014-7|issn=0010-0285}}</ref> Such systems existed before Miller's paper, but there was no convenient term to describe the general strategy or substantive and reliable research. The term \"chunking\" is now often used in reference to these systems. As an illustration, patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] typically experience working memory deficits; chunking is an effective method to improve patients' verbal working memory performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huntley|first=Jonathan|last2=Bor|first2=Daniel|last3=Hampshire|first3=Adam|last4=Owen|first4=Adrian|last5=Howard|first5=Robert|date=May 2011|title=Working memory task performance and chunking in early Alzheimer's disease|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/working-memory-task-performance-and-chunking-in-early-alzheimers-disease/4CCC776A58F051F8E3393E82F0EDBB68|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=198|issue=5|pages=398\u2013403|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083857|issn=0007-1250|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Channel capacity,\"Magic number seven,\" Increase of short-term memory==\n{{Main|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two}}\n\nThe word ''chunking'' comes from a famous 1956 paper by [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neisser|first=Ulric|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/cognitive-psychology/oclc/192730|title=Cognitive psychology|date=1967|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|isbn=978-0-390-66509-6|location=New York|language=English|oclc=192730}}</ref> At a time when [[information theory]] was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a \"channel capacity\" characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about \"seven plus-or-minus two\" chunks. Miller (1956) wrote, \"With binary items the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with [[monosyllabic]] English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, [[memory span]]). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date.\" Miller acknowledged that \"we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMiller (1956) noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. He imagined this process being useful in scenarios such as \"a man just beginning to learn [[morse code|radio-telegraphic code]] hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases.\" Thus, a telegrapher can effectively \"remember\" several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naive subjects can remember a maximum of only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, \"twenty-one\" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Expertise and skilled memory effects==\nStudies have shown that people have better memories when they are trying to remember items with which they are familiar. Similarly, people tend to create chunks with which they are familiar. This familiarity allows them to remember more individual pieces of content, and also more chunks as a whole. One well-known chunking study was conducted by Chase and Ericsson, who worked with an undergraduate student, SF, over two years.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chase|first=William G.|title=Skill and Working Memory|date=1982-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108605460|work=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|volume=16|pages=1\u201358|editor-last=Bower|editor-first=Gordon H.|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60546-0|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Ericsson|first2=K. Anders}}</ref> They wanted to see if a person's digit span could be improved with practice. SF began the experiment with a normal span of 7 digits. SF was a long-distance runner, and chunking strings of digits into race times increased his digit span. By the end of the experiment his digit span had grown to 80 numbers. A later description of the research in ''The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model for 21st Century Schools'' (2012) states that SF later expanded his strategy by incorporating ages and years, but his chunks were always familiar, and thus allowed him to recall the to-be-remembered chunks more easily.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardiman, Mariale M.

Hierarchical representations of sequences have an edge over linear representations. They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the sequence chain, subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower level nodes. \n[[Image:HierarchicalChunking.jpg|600px|center|Schematic of a hierarchical sequential structure with three levels. The lowest level could be a linear representation, while intermediate levels denote chunk nodes. The highest level is the entire sequence.]]\n\nChunks in [[motor learning]] are identified by pauses between successive actions in Terrace (2001).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/terrace/default.htm|title=Serial Organization of Behavior|website=pigeon.psy.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> It is also suggested that during the sequence performance stage (after learning), participants download list items as chunks during pauses. He also argued for an operational definition of chunks suggesting a distinction between the notions of input and output chunks from the ideas of short-term and long-term memory. Input chunks reflect the limitation of working memory during the encoding of new information (how new information is stored in long-term memory), and how it is retrieved during subsequent recall. Output chunks reflect the organization of over-learned motor programs that are generated on-line in working memory. Sakai et al. (2003) showed that participants spontaneously organize a sequence into a number of chunks across few sets, and that these chunks were distinct among participants tested on the same sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sakai|first=Katsuyuki|last2=Kitaguchi|first2=Katsuya|last3=Hikosaka|first3=Okihide|date=2003-09-01|title=Chunking during human visuomotor sequence learning|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-003-1548-8|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=152|issue=2|pages=229\u2013242|doi=10.1007/s00221-003-1548-8|issn=0014-4819}}</ref> They also demonstrated that performance of a shuffled sequence was poorer when the chunk patterns were disrupted than when the chunk patterns were preserved. Chunking patterns also seem to depend on the effectors used.\n\n==Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures==\nThis usage derives from Miller's (1956) idea of chunking as grouping, but the emphasis is now on [[long-term memory]] rather than only on [[short-term memory]].

However, this effect is mediated by specific knowledge of the rules of chess; when pieces were distributed randomly (including scenarios that were not common or allowed in real games), the difference in chunk size between skilled and novice chess players was significantly reduced. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as [[EPAM]] (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and [[CHREST (cognitive architecture)|CHREST]] (Chunk Hierarchy and Retrieval Structures).

These item or information sets are to be stored in the same memory code. The process of recoding is where one learns the code for a chunk, and decoding is when the code is translated into the information that it represents.\n\nThe phenomenon of chunking as a memory mechanism is easily observed in the way individuals group numbers, and information, in the day-to-day life. For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10 and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a day, month and year. It would be stored as December 10, 1946 instead of a string of numbers. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that is beyond the \"seven plus-or-minus two\" memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=George A.|date=1956|title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/h0043158|journal=Psychological Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=81\u201397|doi=10.1037/h0043158|issn=1939-1471}}</ref>\n\n==Modality Effect==\nA [[modality effect]] is present in chunking. That is, the mechanism used to convey the list of items to the individual affects how much \"chunking\" occurs.\n\nExperimentally, it has been found that auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals than visual presentation does. Previous literature, such as George Miller's [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956)]] has shown that the probability of recall of information is greater when the \"chunking\" strategy is used.<ref name=\":0\" /> As stated above, the grouping of the responses occurs as individuals place them into categories according to their inter-relatedness based on semantic and perceptual properties. Lindley (1966) showed that since the groups produced have meaning to the participant, this strategy makes it easier for an individual to recall and maintain information in memory during studies and testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Richard H.|date=1966-08-01|title=Recoding as a function of chunking and meaningfulness|journal=Psychonomic Science|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=393\u2013394|doi=10.3758/BF03330953|issn=0033-3131|doi-access=free}}</ref> Therefore, when \"chunking\" is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.\n\n==Memory training systems, mnemonic==\nVarious kinds of [[memory]] training systems and [[mnemonics]] include training and drill in specially-designed recoding or chunking schemes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Don R.|date=1977-10-01|title=Individual differences in immediate serial recall: A matter of mnemonics?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028577900147|journal=Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=403\u2013411|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(77)90014-7|issn=0010-0285}}</ref> Such systems existed before Miller's paper, but there was no convenient term to describe the general strategy or substantive and reliable research.

Miller]], \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neisser|first=Ulric|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/cognitive-psychology/oclc/192730|title=Cognitive psychology|date=1967|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|isbn=978-0-390-66509-6|location=New York|language=English|oclc=192730}}</ref> At a time when [[information theory]] was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a \"channel capacity\" characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about \"seven plus-or-minus two\" chunks. Miller (1956) wrote, \"With binary items the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with [[monosyllabic]] English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, [[memory span]]). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date.\" Miller acknowledged that \"we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMiller (1956) noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. He imagined this process being useful in scenarios such as \"a man just beginning to learn [[morse code|radio-telegraphic code]] hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases.\" Thus, a telegrapher can effectively \"remember\" several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naive subjects can remember a maximum of only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, \"twenty-one\" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Expertise and skilled memory effects==\nStudies have shown that people have better memories when they are trying to remember items with which they are familiar. Similarly, people tend to create chunks with which they are familiar. This familiarity allows them to remember more individual pieces of content, and also more chunks as a whole. One well-known chunking study was conducted by Chase and Ericsson, who worked with an undergraduate student, SF, over two years.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chase|first=William G.|title=Skill and Working Memory|date=1982-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108605460|work=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|volume=16|pages=1\u201358|editor-last=Bower|editor-first=Gordon H.|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60546-0|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Ericsson|first2=K. Anders}}</ref> They wanted to see if a person's digit span could be improved with practice. SF began the experiment with a normal span of 7 digits. SF was a long-distance runner, and chunking strings of digits into race times increased his digit span. By the end of the experiment his digit span had grown to 80 numbers. A later description of the research in ''The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model for 21st Century Schools'' (2012) states that SF later expanded his strategy by incorporating ages and years, but his chunks were always familiar, and thus allowed him to recall the to-be-remembered chunks more easily.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardiman, Mariale M.

Hierarchical representations of sequences have an edge over linear representations. They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the sequence chain, subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower level nodes. \n[[Image:HierarchicalChunking.jpg|600px|center|Schematic of a hierarchical sequential structure with three levels. The lowest level could be a linear representation, while intermediate levels denote chunk nodes. The highest level is the entire sequence.]]\n\nChunks in [[motor learning]] are identified by pauses between successive actions in Terrace (2001).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/terrace/default.htm|title=Serial Organization of Behavior|website=pigeon.psy.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> It is also suggested that during the sequence performance stage (after learning), participants download list items as chunks during pauses. He also argued for an operational definition of chunks suggesting a distinction between the notions of input and output chunks from the ideas of short-term and long-term memory. Input chunks reflect the limitation of working memory during the encoding of new information (how new information is stored in long-term memory), and how it is retrieved during subsequent recall. Output chunks reflect the organization of over-learned motor programs that are generated on-line in working memory. Sakai et al. (2003) showed that participants spontaneously organize a sequence into a number of chunks across few sets, and that these chunks were distinct among participants tested on the same sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sakai|first=Katsuyuki|last2=Kitaguchi|first2=Katsuya|last3=Hikosaka|first3=Okihide|date=2003-09-01|title=Chunking during human visuomotor sequence learning|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-003-1548-8|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=152|issue=2|pages=229\u2013242|doi=10.1007/s00221-003-1548-8|issn=0014-4819}}</ref> They also demonstrated that performance of a shuffled sequence was poorer when the chunk patterns were disrupted than when the chunk patterns were preserved. Chunking patterns also seem to depend on the effectors used.\n\n==Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures==\nThis usage derives from Miller's (1956) idea of chunking as grouping, but the emphasis is now on [[long-term memory]] rather than only on [[short-term memory]].

However, this effect is mediated by specific knowledge of the rules of chess; when pieces were distributed randomly (including scenarios that were not common or allowed in real games), the difference in chunk size between skilled and novice chess players was significantly reduced. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as [[EPAM]] (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and [[CHREST (cognitive architecture)|CHREST]] (Chunk Hierarchy and Retrieval Structures).

The [[Colonial Mauritania|colonial period of Mauritania]] lasted for a mere two generations, from 1904 to 1960.\nThe French authorities had difficulty in maintaining order in view of the numerous and complicated conflicts among the area's numerous factions and sub-factions.

In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe divisive tendencies of the various groups within Mauritanian society have always worked against the development of Mauritanian unity. Both the [[Sanhadja Confederation]], at its height from the 8th century to the 10th century, and the [[Almoravid Empire]], from the 11th century to the 12th century, were weakened by internecine warfare, and succumbed to further invasions from the [[Ghana Empire]] and the [[Almohad Empire]], respectively.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe first external influence that tended to unify the country was [[Islam]]. The [[Islam in Mauritania|Islamization of Mauritania]] was a gradual process that spanned more than 500 years. Beginning slowly through contacts with Berber and Arab merchants engaged in the important [[Convoy|caravan]] trades and rapidly advancing through the Almoravid conquests, Islamization did not take firm hold until the arrival of [[Yemen]]i Arabs in the 12th and 13th centuries and was not complete until several centuries later. Gradual Islamization was accompanied by a process of [[Arabization]] as well, during which the Berber masters of Mauritania lost power and became vassals of their Arab conquerors.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrom the 15th century to the 19th century, European contact with Mauritania was dominated by the trade for [[gum arabic]]. Rivalries among European powers enabled the Arab-Berber population, the [[Maures]] (Moors), to maintain their independence and later to exact annual payments from France, whose sovereignty over the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]] and the Mauritanian coast was recognized by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Although penetration beyond the coast and the Senegal River began in earnest under [[Louis Faidherbe]], governor of Senegal in the mid-19th century, European conquest or \"pacification\" of the entire country did not begin until 1900.\n\n[[France]] created the boundaries of contemporary [[Mauritania]] and administered it until the independence in the 1960s. Because extensive European contact began so late in the country's history, the traditional social structure carried over into modern times with little change.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrench rule brought legal prohibitions against [[slavery]], and an end to interclan warfare. During the [[Colonial Mauritania|colonial period]], the population remained nomadic, but many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania. As the country gained independence in 1960, the capital city [[Nouakchott]] was founded at the site of a small colonial village, the Ksar, while 90% of the population was still nomadic.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Serer ancient history}}\n{{History of Mauritania sidebar}}\n\nThe [[prehistory]] of the west Saharan region is not fully characterised. There are some written accounts by medieval [[Arab]] traders and explorers who reached the important [[Trans-Saharan trade|caravan trading centers]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of eastern Mauritania, but the major sources of pre-European history are oral history, legends, and archaeological evidence. These sources indicate that during the millennia preceding the Christian Era, the [[Sahara]] was a more habitable region than it is today and supported a flourishing culture. In the area that is now Mauritania, the [[Bafour]], a proto-[[Berber people|Berber]] people, whose descendants may be the coastal [[Imraguen people|Imraguen]] fishermen, were hunters, pastoralists, and fishermen. Valley cultivators, who may have been black ancestors of the riverine [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] peoples, lived alongside the Bafour. [[Dhar Tichitt]] is the oldest surviving archaeological settlements in West Africa and the oldest of all stone base settlements south of the Sahara. It was built by the [[Soninke people]] (or by the [[Serer people|Serers]]<ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool'', Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  pp 9, 20,  77, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>) and is thought to be the precursor of the [[Ghana empire]], thought to have been built by Wolof people or Wolof-related ancestors. It was being settled around 2000 BCE.<ref>Fage, J.D(1976). The Cambridge history of Africa, Volume 5.

In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe Romans did some [[Roman expeditions to Sub-Saharan Africa|expeditions]] south of their [[Mauretania Tingitana]], perhaps reaching the area north of the river [[Senegal]] populated by the Pharusii tribe.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=f_QRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=pharusii+mauretania&source=bl&ots=m4YgoVQtiw&sig=V3UjnglhAhlw2jDpLhlnIyIwhSI&hl=it&ei=1f_iTK2rO4K8lQfO3JCZDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Pharusii tribe]</ref>\n\nIn the 3rd and 4th centuries, this southward migration from the southern Atlas region was intensified by the arrival of Berber groups from the north who were searching for pasturage or fleeing political anarchy and war. The wide-ranging activities of these turbulent Berber warriors were made possible by the introduction of the [[camel]] to the Sahara in this period. This first wave of Berber invaders subjugated and made [[vassal]]s of those Bafour who did not flee south. Other Berber groups followed in the 7th and 8th centuries, themselves fleeing in large numbers before the Arab conquerors of the [[Maghreb]].<ref name=eh/>\n\n==Arab invasions==\nBeginning with the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Arab conquest of the western Maghreb]] in the 8th century, Mauritania experienced a slow but constant infiltration of Arabs and Arab influence from the north. The growing Arab presence pressed the Berbers, who chose not to mix with other groups, to move farther south into Mauritania, forcing out the black inhabitants. By the 16th century, most blacks had been pushed to the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]]. Those remaining in the north became [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]] cultivating the [[oases]].<ref name=ai>Warner, Rachel. \"Arab invasions\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Almoravid Empire, a long process of Arabization began in Mauritania, one that until then had been resisted successfully by the Berbers. Several groups of [[Yemen]]i Arabs who had been in the north of Africa turned south to Mauritania. Settling in northern Mauritania, they disrupted the [[caravan trade]], causing routes to shift east, which in turn led to the gradual decline of Mauritania's trading towns. One particular Yemeni group, the [[Beni \u1e24ass\u0101n|Bani Hassan]], continued to migrate southward until, by the end of the 17th century, they dominated the entire country. The last effort of the Berbers to shake off the Arab yoke was the [[Mauritanian Thirty Years' War]] (1644\u201374), or Sharr Bubba, led by [[Nasr ad-Din (Lamtuna)|Nasr ad-Din]], a [[Lemtuna]] [[imam]]. This Sanhadja war of liberation was, however, unsuccessful; the Berbers were forced to abandon the sword and became vassals to the warrior Arab groups.<ref name=ai/>\n\nThus, the contemporary social structure of Mauritania can be dated from 1674. The warrior groups or Arabs dominated the Berber groups, who turned to [[cleric]]alism to regain a degree of ascendancy. At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves, subservient to both warriors and Islamic holy men. All of these groups, whose language was [[Hassaniya Arabic]], became known as [[Maures]]. The bitter rivalries and resentments characteristic of their social structure were later fully exploited by the French.<ref name=ai/>\n\n==Sanhadja Confederation==\nOne of the Berber groups arriving in Mauritania in the 8th century was the [[Lemtuna]]. By the 9th century, the Lemtuna had attained political dominance in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] and [[Hodh El Gharbi Region|Hodh]] regions. Together with two other important Berber groups, the [[Messufa]] and the [[Godala]], they set up the [[Sanhadja Confederation]]. From their capital, [[Aoudaghast]], the Lemtuna controlled this loose confederation and the western routes of the Saharan caravan trade that had begun to flourish after the introduction of the camel. At its height, from the eighth to the end of the 10th century, the Sanhadja Confederation was a decentralized [[polity]] based on two distinct groups: the nomadic and very independent Berber groups, who maintained their traditional religions, and the Muslim, urban Berber merchants, who conducted the caravan trade.<ref name=sc>Warner, Rachel. \"Sanhadja Confederation\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nAlthough dominated by the [[Sanhadja]] merchants, the caravan trade had its northern terminus in the [[Maghreb|Maghribi]] commercial city of [[Sijilmasa]] and its southern terminus in [[Koumbi Saleh]], capital of the [[Ghana Empire]]. Later, the southern trade route ended in [[Timbuktu]], capital of the [[Mali Empire]]. [[Gold]], [[ivory]], and [[Arab slave trade|slaves]] were carried north in return for salt (ancient [[salt mine]]s near [[Kediet Ijill]] in northern Mauritania are still being worked), [[copper]], cloth, and other luxury goods.<ref name=sc/>\n\nImportant towns developed along the trade routes. The easiest, though not the shortest, routes between Ghana and Sijilmasa were from [[Koumbi Saleh]] through [[Aoudaghast]], [[Oual\u00e2ta]], [[T\u00eech\u00eet]], and [[Ouadane]]. These towns along the route grew to be important commercial as well as political centers. The 11th-century Arab chronicler [[Al-Bakri]] describes Aoudaghast, with its population of 5,000 to 6,000, as a big town with a large mosque and several smaller ones, surrounded by large cultivated areas under irrigation. Oual\u00e2ta was a major relay point on the gold and salt trade route, as well as a chief assembly point for [[Hajj|pilgrims traveling to Mecca]]. Koumbi Saleh was a large cosmopolitan city comprising two distinct sections: the Muslim quarter, with its Arab-influenced architecture, and the black quarter of traditional thatch and mud architecture, where the non-Muslim [[king of Ghana]] resided. Another important Mauritanian trade city of the Sanhadja Confederation was [[Chinguetti]], later an important religious center. Although Koumbi Saleh did not outlive the fall of the Ghana Empire, Aoudaghast and particularly Oual\u00e2ta maintained their importance well into the 16th century, when trade began shifting to the European-controlled coasts.<ref name=sc/>\n\n==Almoravids==\n{{see also|Almoravid dynasty|Serer history (medieval era to present)}}\nBy the 11th century, Islam had spread throughout the west Sahara under the influence of Berber and Arab traders and occasional Arab migrants. Nevertheless, [[African traditional religion|traditional religious practices]] thrived. The conquest of the entire west Saharan region by the [[Almoravids]] in the 11th century made possible a more orthodox Islamization of all the peoples of Mauritania.<ref name=a>Warner, Rachel. \"Almoravids\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe breakup of the Sanhadja Confederation in the early 11th century led to a period of unrest and warfare among the Sanhadja Berber groups of Mauritania. In about 1039, a chief of the [[Godala]], [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca bringing with him a Sanhadja theologian, [[Abdallah ibn Yassin]], to teach a more orthodox Islam. Rejected by the Godala two years later, after the death of Ibn Ibrahim, Ibn Yassin and some of his Sanhadja followers retired to a secluded place where they built a fortified religious center, a [[ribat]], which attracted many Sanhadja. In 1042 the [[al murabitun]] (men of the ribat), as Ibn Yassin's followers came to be called, launched a [[jihad]], or holy war, against the nonbelievers and the heretics among the Sanhadja, beginning what later become known as the Almoravid movement. The initial aim of the Almoravids was to establish a political community in which the ethical and juridical principles of Islam would be strictly applied.<ref name=a/>\n\nFirst, the Almoravids attacked and subdued the Godala, forcing them to acknowledge Islam. Then, rallying the other Berber groups of the west Sahara, the Almoravids succeeded in recreating the political unity of the Sanhadja Confederation and adding to it a religious unity and purpose. By 1054 the Almoravids had captured Sijilmasa in the Maghrib and had retaken Aoudaghast from Ghana.<ref name=a/>\n\nWith the death of Ibn Yassin in 1059, leadership of the movement in the south passed to [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]], [[amir]] of Adrar, and to [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] in the north. Under Ibn Tashfin, the Berbers captured [[Morocco]] and founded [[Marrakech]] as their capital in 1062. By 1082 all of the western Maghrib (to at least present-day [[Algiers]]) was under Almoravid domination. In 1086 the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian emirates]], under attack from the Spanish Christian [[Alfonso VI of Castile|king Alfonso]] and the [[Christian reconquest of Spain]], called on Ibn Tashfin and his Berber warriors to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and come to their rescue. The Almoravids [[Sagrajas|defeated]] the Spanish Christians and, by 1090, imposed Almoravid rule and the [[Maliki]] school of Islamic law in Muslim Spain.<ref name=a/>\n\nIn Mauritania, Abu Bakr led the Almoravids in a war against Ghana (1062\u201376), culminating in the capture in 1076 of Koumbi Saleh. This event marked the end of the dominance of the Ghana Empire. But after the death of Abu Bakr in 1087 and Ibn Tashfin in 1106, traditional rivalries among the Sanhadja and a new Muslim reformist conquest led by the [[Zenata]] [[Almohad]]s (1133\u201363) destroyed the Almoravid Empire.<ref name=a/>\n\nFor a short time, the Mauritanian Sanhadja dynasty of the Almoravid Empire controlled a vast territory stretching from Spain to [[Senegal]]. The unity established between Morocco and Mauritania during the Almoravid period continued to have some political importance in the 1980s, as it formed part of the basis for Morocco's claims to Mauritania. But the greatest contribution of the Sanhadja and the Almoravids was the Islamization of the western Maghrib. This process would remain a dominant factor in the history of the area for the next several centuries.<ref name=a/>\n\n==Sudanic empires and kingdoms==\nAlthough the Almoravids had substantial contacts with the Maghrib, influences from the [[black people|black]] [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]], and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] played an important role in Mauritania's history for about 700 years\u2014from the 8th to the 15th century. Ghana, the first of the great West African Sudanic kingdoms, included in its territory all of southeastern Mauritania extending to [[Tagant Plateau|Tagant]]. Ghana reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries with the extension of its rule over the Sanhadja Berbers. This large and centralized kingdom controlled the southern terminus of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, and salt.<ref name=sek>Warner, Rachel. \"Sudanic empires and kingdoms\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe capture of Koumbi Saleh in 1076 by the Almoravids marked the end of Ghana's [[hegemony]], although the kingdom continued to exist for another 125 years. The [[Mand\u00e9]], under the leadership of the legendary [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]], founded the second great Sudanic kingdom, Mali. By the end of the 13th century, the Mali Empire extended over that part of Mauritania previously controlled by Ghana, as well as over the remaining [[Sahel]]ian regions and the [[Senegal River Valley]]. Sundiata and his successors took over Ghana's role in the Saharan trade and in the administration and collection of [[tribute]] from vast stretches of the Sudan and the Sahel.<ref name=sek/>\n\nThe slow decline of the Mali Empire that started at the end of the 14th century came about through internal discord and revolts by the inhabitants of vassal states, including the Songhai of [[Gao]]. By the end of the 15th century, the Songhai Empire had replaced the Mali Empire and extended to Mauritania and the upper Senegal River Valley. At the end of the 16th century, a large Moroccan force defeated the Songhai, bringing to an end the seven centuries of domination of the western Sudan (and a large part of Mauritania) by strong, centralized black kingdoms.<ref name=sek/>\n\n==Early European involvement==\nDespite the Almoravid domination of Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries, there seems to be little evidence of contact during that time between Mauritania and Europe. The inhospitable coastline of Mauritania continued to deter voyagers until the Portuguese began their [[European exploration of Africa|African explorations]] in the 15th century.  The area of Mauritania was of little interest to either Arab or European conquerors; the existence of gold reserves in the interior was not yet known, and the important trade routes passed the territory well to the east, through [[Timbuktu]].  The [[Saadi dynasty]] conquered much of the Saharan interior but did not show interest in expanding their territory westward.\n\nThe Portuguese had established a trading fort at [[Arguin]], southeast of Cap Blanc (present-day [[Ras Nouadhibou]]), in 1455. \nThe king of Portugal also maintained a [[commercial agent]] at [[Ouadane]] in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] in an attempt to divert gold traveling north by caravan. Having only slight success in their quest for gold, the Portuguese quickly adapted to dealing in slaves. In the mid-15th century, as many as 1,000 slaves per year were exported from Arguin to Europe and to the Portuguese [[sugar plantation]]s on the island of [[Sao Tom\u00e9]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref name=eec>Warner, Rachel. \"Early European contacts\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Iberian Union|merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns]] in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the [[gum arabic]] trade. Produced by the [[acacia]] trees of [[Trarza]] and [[Brakna]] and used in [[Textile printing|textile pattern printing]], this gum arabic was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. \nBy 1678 the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] at the mouth of the Senegal River, where the French [[Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] had been trading for more than fifty years.<ref name=eec/>\n\nThe [[Maures]], with whom the Europeans were trading, considered the constant rivalries between European powers a sign of weakness, and they quickly learned the benefits of playing one power against the other. For example, they agreed simultaneously to give monopolies to the French and the Dutch. The Maures also took advantage of the Europeans whenever possible, so that when the French negotiated with the [[Emirate of Trarza|emir of Trarza]] to secure a monopoly on the gum arabic trade, the amir in exchange demanded a considerable number of gifts. Thus began the [[coutume]], an annual payment expected by the Maures for doing business with a government or a company. By 1763 the British had expelled France from the West African coast, and France recovered control only when the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 recognized French sovereignty over the coast of West Africa from Cap Blanc south to Senegal.<ref name=eec/>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*Handloff, Robert E., editor.

In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe divisive tendencies of the various groups within Mauritanian society have always worked against the development of Mauritanian unity. Both the [[Sanhadja Confederation]], at its height from the 8th century to the 10th century, and the [[Almoravid Empire]], from the 11th century to the 12th century, were weakened by internecine warfare, and succumbed to further invasions from the [[Ghana Empire]] and the [[Almohad Empire]], respectively.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe first external influence that tended to unify the country was [[Islam]]. The [[Islam in Mauritania|Islamization of Mauritania]] was a gradual process that spanned more than 500 years. Beginning slowly through contacts with Berber and Arab merchants engaged in the important [[Convoy|caravan]] trades and rapidly advancing through the Almoravid conquests, Islamization did not take firm hold until the arrival of [[Yemen]]i Arabs in the 12th and 13th centuries and was not complete until several centuries later. Gradual Islamization was accompanied by a process of [[Arabization]] as well, during which the Berber masters of Mauritania lost power and became vassals of their Arab conquerors.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrom the 15th century to the 19th century, European contact with Mauritania was dominated by the trade for [[gum arabic]]. Rivalries among European powers enabled the Arab-Berber population, the [[Maures]] (Moors), to maintain their independence and later to exact annual payments from France, whose sovereignty over the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]] and the Mauritanian coast was recognized by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Although penetration beyond the coast and the Senegal River began in earnest under [[Louis Faidherbe]], governor of Senegal in the mid-19th century, European conquest or \"pacification\" of the entire country did not begin until 1900.\n\n[[France]] created the boundaries of contemporary [[Mauritania]] and administered it until the independence in the 1960s. Because extensive European contact began so late in the country's history, the traditional social structure carried over into modern times with little change.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrench rule brought legal prohibitions against [[slavery]], and an end to interclan warfare. During the [[Colonial Mauritania|colonial period]], the population remained nomadic, but many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania. As the country gained independence in 1960, the capital city [[Nouakchott]] was founded at the site of a small colonial village, the Ksar, while 90% of the population was still nomadic.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Serer ancient history}}\n{{History of Mauritania sidebar}}\n\nThe [[prehistory]] of the west Saharan region is not fully characterised. There are some written accounts by medieval [[Arab]] traders and explorers who reached the important [[Trans-Saharan trade|caravan trading centers]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of eastern Mauritania, but the major sources of pre-European history are oral history, legends, and archaeological evidence. These sources indicate that during the millennia preceding the Christian Era, the [[Sahara]] was a more habitable region than it is today and supported a flourishing culture. In the area that is now Mauritania, the [[Bafour]], a proto-[[Berber people|Berber]] people, whose descendants may be the coastal [[Imraguen people|Imraguen]] fishermen, were hunters, pastoralists, and fishermen. Valley cultivators, who may have been black ancestors of the riverine [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] peoples, lived alongside the Bafour. [[Dhar Tichitt]] is the oldest surviving archaeological settlements in West Africa and the oldest of all stone base settlements south of the Sahara. It was built by the [[Soninke people]] (or by the [[Serer people|Serers]]<ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool'', Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  pp 9, 20,  77, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>) and is thought to be the precursor of the [[Ghana empire]], thought to have been built by Wolof people or Wolof-related ancestors.

The wide-ranging activities of these turbulent Berber warriors were made possible by the introduction of the [[camel]] to the Sahara in this period. This first wave of Berber invaders subjugated and made [[vassal]]s of those Bafour who did not flee south. Other Berber groups followed in the 7th and 8th centuries, themselves fleeing in large numbers before the Arab conquerors of the [[Maghreb]].<ref name=eh/>\n\n==Arab invasions==\nBeginning with the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Arab conquest of the western Maghreb]] in the 8th century, Mauritania experienced a slow but constant infiltration of Arabs and Arab influence from the north. The growing Arab presence pressed the Berbers, who chose not to mix with other groups, to move farther south into Mauritania, forcing out the black inhabitants. By the 16th century, most blacks had been pushed to the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]]. Those remaining in the north became [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]] cultivating the [[oases]].<ref name=ai>Warner, Rachel. \"Arab invasions\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Almoravid Empire, a long process of Arabization began in Mauritania, one that until then had been resisted successfully by the Berbers. Several groups of [[Yemen]]i Arabs who had been in the north of Africa turned south to Mauritania. Settling in northern Mauritania, they disrupted the [[caravan trade]], causing routes to shift east, which in turn led to the gradual decline of Mauritania's trading towns. One particular Yemeni group, the [[Beni \u1e24ass\u0101n|Bani Hassan]], continued to migrate southward until, by the end of the 17th century, they dominated the entire country. The last effort of the Berbers to shake off the Arab yoke was the [[Mauritanian Thirty Years' War]] (1644\u201374), or Sharr Bubba, led by [[Nasr ad-Din (Lamtuna)|Nasr ad-Din]], a [[Lemtuna]] [[imam]]. This Sanhadja war of liberation was, however, unsuccessful; the Berbers were forced to abandon the sword and became vassals to the warrior Arab groups.<ref name=ai/>\n\nThus, the contemporary social structure of Mauritania can be dated from 1674. The warrior groups or Arabs dominated the Berber groups, who turned to [[cleric]]alism to regain a degree of ascendancy. At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves, subservient to both warriors and Islamic holy men. All of these groups, whose language was [[Hassaniya Arabic]], became known as [[Maures]].

By the 9th century, the Lemtuna had attained political dominance in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] and [[Hodh El Gharbi Region|Hodh]] regions. Together with two other important Berber groups, the [[Messufa]] and the [[Godala]], they set up the [[Sanhadja Confederation]].

Later, the southern trade route ended in [[Timbuktu]], capital of the [[Mali Empire]]. [[Gold]], [[ivory]], and [[Arab slave trade|slaves]] were carried north in return for salt (ancient [[salt mine]]s near [[Kediet Ijill]] in northern Mauritania are still being worked), [[copper]], cloth, and other luxury goods.<ref name=sc/>\n\nImportant towns developed along the trade routes.

By 1054 the Almoravids had captured Sijilmasa in the Maghrib and had retaken Aoudaghast from Ghana.<ref name=a/>\n\nWith the death of Ibn Yassin in 1059, leadership of the movement in the south passed to [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]], [[amir]] of Adrar, and to [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] in the north. Under Ibn Tashfin, the Berbers captured [[Morocco]] and founded [[Marrakech]] as their capital in 1062. By 1082 all of the western Maghrib (to at least present-day [[Algiers]]) was under Almoravid domination. In 1086 the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian emirates]], under attack from the Spanish Christian [[Alfonso VI of Castile|king Alfonso]] and the [[Christian reconquest of Spain]], called on Ibn Tashfin and his Berber warriors to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and come to their rescue. The Almoravids [[Sagrajas|defeated]] the Spanish Christians and, by 1090, imposed Almoravid rule and the [[Maliki]] school of Islamic law in Muslim Spain.<ref name=a/>\n\nIn Mauritania, Abu Bakr led the Almoravids in a war against Ghana (1062\u201376), culminating in the capture in 1076 of Koumbi Saleh. This event marked the end of the dominance of the Ghana Empire. But after the death of Abu Bakr in 1087 and Ibn Tashfin in 1106, traditional rivalries among the Sanhadja and a new Muslim reformist conquest led by the [[Zenata]] [[Almohad]]s (1133\u201363) destroyed the Almoravid Empire.<ref name=a/>\n\nFor a short time, the Mauritanian Sanhadja dynasty of the Almoravid Empire controlled a vast territory stretching from Spain to [[Senegal]]. The unity established between Morocco and Mauritania during the Almoravid period continued to have some political importance in the 1980s, as it formed part of the basis for Morocco's claims to Mauritania. But the greatest contribution of the Sanhadja and the Almoravids was the Islamization of the western Maghrib. This process would remain a dominant factor in the history of the area for the next several centuries.<ref name=a/>\n\n==Sudanic empires and kingdoms==\nAlthough the Almoravids had substantial contacts with the Maghrib, influences from the [[black people|black]] [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]], and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] played an important role in Mauritania's history for about 700 years\u2014from the 8th to the 15th century. Ghana, the first of the great West African Sudanic kingdoms, included in its territory all of southeastern Mauritania extending to [[Tagant Plateau|Tagant]]. Ghana reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries with the extension of its rule over the Sanhadja Berbers. This large and centralized kingdom controlled the southern terminus of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, and salt.<ref name=sek>Warner, Rachel. \"Sudanic empires and kingdoms\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe capture of Koumbi Saleh in 1076 by the Almoravids marked the end of Ghana's [[hegemony]], although the kingdom continued to exist for another 125 years. The [[Mand\u00e9]], under the leadership of the legendary [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]], founded the second great Sudanic kingdom, Mali. By the end of the 13th century, the Mali Empire extended over that part of Mauritania previously controlled by Ghana, as well as over the remaining [[Sahel]]ian regions and the [[Senegal River Valley]]. Sundiata and his successors took over Ghana's role in the Saharan trade and in the administration and collection of [[tribute]] from vast stretches of the Sudan and the Sahel.<ref name=sek/>\n\nThe slow decline of the Mali Empire that started at the end of the 14th century came about through internal discord and revolts by the inhabitants of vassal states, including the Songhai of [[Gao]]. By the end of the 15th century, the Songhai Empire had replaced the Mali Empire and extended to Mauritania and the upper Senegal River Valley. At the end of the 16th century, a large Moroccan force defeated the Songhai, bringing to an end the seven centuries of domination of the western Sudan (and a large part of Mauritania) by strong, centralized black kingdoms.<ref name=sek/>\n\n==Early European involvement==\nDespite the Almoravid domination of Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries, there seems to be little evidence of contact during that time between Mauritania and Europe. The inhospitable coastline of Mauritania continued to deter voyagers until the Portuguese began their [[European exploration of Africa|African explorations]] in the 15th century.  The area of Mauritania was of little interest to either Arab or European conquerors; the existence of gold reserves in the interior was not yet known, and the important trade routes passed the territory well to the east, through [[Timbuktu]].  The [[Saadi dynasty]] conquered much of the Saharan interior but did not show interest in expanding their territory westward.\n\nThe Portuguese had established a trading fort at [[Arguin]], southeast of Cap Blanc (present-day [[Ras Nouadhibou]]), in 1455. \nThe king of Portugal also maintained a [[commercial agent]] at [[Ouadane]] in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] in an attempt to divert gold traveling north by caravan. Having only slight success in their quest for gold, the Portuguese quickly adapted to dealing in slaves. In the mid-15th century, as many as 1,000 slaves per year were exported from Arguin to Europe and to the Portuguese [[sugar plantation]]s on the island of [[Sao Tom\u00e9]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref name=eec>Warner, Rachel. \"Early European contacts\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Iberian Union|merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns]] in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the [[gum arabic]] trade. Produced by the [[acacia]] trees of [[Trarza]] and [[Brakna]] and used in [[Textile printing|textile pattern printing]], this gum arabic was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. \nBy 1678 the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] at the mouth of the Senegal River, where the French [[Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] had been trading for more than fifty years.<ref name=eec/>\n\nThe [[Maures]], with whom the Europeans were trading, considered the constant rivalries between European powers a sign of weakness, and they quickly learned the benefits of playing one power against the other. For example, they agreed simultaneously to give monopolies to the French and the Dutch. The Maures also took advantage of the Europeans whenever possible, so that when the French negotiated with the [[Emirate of Trarza|emir of Trarza]] to secure a monopoly on the gum arabic trade, the amir in exchange demanded a considerable number of gifts. Thus began the [[coutume]], an annual payment expected by the Maures for doing business with a government or a company. By 1763 the British had expelled France from the West African coast, and France recovered control only when the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 recognized French sovereignty over the coast of West Africa from Cap Blanc south to Senegal.<ref name=eec/>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*Handloff, Robert E., editor.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Jacoby Shaddix]], guitarist [[Jerry Horton]], drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.\n\nAfter two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999. It released the triple-platinum ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' in 2000, the gold album ''[[Lovehatetragedy]]'' in 2002 and the platinum album ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 2004. A year after ''[[The Paramour Sessions]]'', Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by [[Tony Palermo]]. They then made ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2009), ''[[Time for Annihilation]]'' (2010), ''[[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|The Connection]]'' (2012), ''[[F.E.A.R. (Papa Roach album)|F.E.A.R.]]'' (2015),  and ''[[Crooked Teeth (album)|Crooked Teeth]]'' (2017). The tenth studio album, ''[[Who Do You Trust? (album)|Who Do You Trust?]]'', was released on January 18, 2019.\n\nPapa Roach has sold more than 20 million album copies worldwide and are known for their songs \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Between Angels and Insects]]\", \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\", \"[[Getting Away with Murder (song)|Getting Away with Murder]]\", \"[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]\", \"[[Forever (Papa Roach song)|Forever]]\", \"[[Lifeline (Papa Roach song)|Lifeline]]\", and \"[[Face Everything and Rise (song)|Face Everything and Rise]]\".<!--, among others-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1993\u20131995)===\nPapa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]] and drummer Dave Buckner met on the [[Vacaville High School]] football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist [[Jerry Horton]] from nearby [[Vanden High School]], trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James.<reF>[https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-infest-made-papa-roach-superstars/ Kerrang source]</reF> They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s song \"[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]\". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig they could get. Their first tour van was called Moby Dick, where Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name \"Coby Dick\". The band chose the name Papa Roach from the nickname of Shaddix's step-grandfather, Howard William Roatch.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| date       = December 2000\n| title      = No Way Home\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=aPe2ZKjsEBIC&lpg=PT33&dq=vol%2016%20%200886-3032&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=roatch&f=false\n| magazine   = Spin Magazine\n}}</ref>\nIn 1994, Papa Roach released their first [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending the year in [[Seattle]] studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled ''Caca Bonita''. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp would limit the band's summer practicing and touring.\n\n===''Old Friends from Young Years'' and record deal (1996\u20131999)===\n{{Main|Old Friends from Young Years}}\n[[file:Papa Roach - Rock am Ring 2015-9782.jpg|thumb|Lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]].]]\nOn February 4, 1997, the band produced their debut studio album, entitled ''[[Old Friends from Young Years]]''. Still touring heavily, they supported bands such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Hed PE]], [[Snot (band)|Snot]], [[Far (band)|Far]], and [[Static-X]].\n\nIn 1998, they released an EP titled ''[[5 Tracks Deep]]''. It sold more than 1,000 copies in its first month of release. In 1999, they produced another EP, which would end up being their last independent release, titled ''[[Let 'Em Know]]''. Its success caught the attention of [[Warner Music Group]], who as part of a development deal provided a small amount of money for the production of a five-track promo-demo CD.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html \"Interview With Jay Baumgardner\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017122140/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html |date=2012-10-17 }}, ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 25 Apr 2005.</ref> The band decided they wanted influential rock producer [[Jay Baumgardner]] on board to produce the record.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Baumgardner said, \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club - I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that\u2019s when I realized that they definitely had potential.\u201d<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. was not impressed with the demo, and elected not to sign them.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The unreleased disc included the songs \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\", and \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\".\n\nSoon after, [[DreamWorks Records]] offered the band a recording contract.\n\n===Mainstream success, ''Infest, Lovehatetragedy'' and ''Getting Away With Murder'' (2000\u20132005)===\n[[file:Papa Roach 2006.jpg|thumb|The band in 2006. from left to right: Dave Buckner, Tobin Esperance, Jacoby Shaddix, Jerry Horton]]\nAfter signing with DreamWorks Records in October 1999, they immediately entered the studio to record their major-label debut  album titled ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.27.00/edge-0017.html|title=Metroactive Music - The Edge|website=www.metroactive.com|accessdate=10 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725232838/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.27.00/edge-0017.html|archivedate=25 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://76.12.46.30/interviews/2000/paparoach.htm|title=Interview with Tobin Esperance of Papa Roach (NY Rock)|website=76.12.46.30|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref> The album included old songs from their independent releases, these being \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\" from the Warner Bros. demo CD; \"Revenge In Japanese\" as \"Revenge\" and \"Thrown Away\" from their ''5 Tracks Deep'' EP; \"Legacy\", \"Binge\", \"Snakes\", and a softer version of the originally heavier \"Tightrope\" from the ''[[Let 'Em Know]]'' EP; which were re-recorded, and three additional newly written songs: \"[[Between Angels and Insects|Obsession]]\" (later known as \"Between Angels and Insects\"), \"Blood Brothers\", and \"Never Enough\".

The band named the title after the recording location, the [[Paramour Mansion]]. The band came up with the idea of doing an album in a mansion while they were recording ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'', Shaddix stated that recording in a manor was becoming popular for the unique sound and feeling it generates (which is reflected on the lyrics). \"[[...To Be Loved]]\" was the first single to be released from the album, and was the official theme song for ''[[WWE Raw]]'' from 2006 to 2009 until it was replaced by \"[[Burn It to the Ground]]\" by [[Nickelback]]. The album continued in an alternative rock-based direction but still contained softer ballads akin to ''Getting Away with Murder''.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Jacoby Shaddix]], guitarist [[Jerry Horton]], drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.\n\nAfter two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999. It released the triple-platinum ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' in 2000, the gold album ''[[Lovehatetragedy]]'' in 2002 and the platinum album ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 2004. A year after ''[[The Paramour Sessions]]'', Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by [[Tony Palermo]]. They then made ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2009), ''[[Time for Annihilation]]'' (2010), ''[[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|The Connection]]'' (2012), ''[[F.E.A.R. (Papa Roach album)|F.E.A.R.]]'' (2015),  and ''[[Crooked Teeth (album)|Crooked Teeth]]'' (2017). The tenth studio album, ''[[Who Do You Trust? (album)|Who Do You Trust?]]'', was released on January 18, 2019.\n\nPapa Roach has sold more than 20 million album copies worldwide and are known for their songs \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Between Angels and Insects]]\", \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\", \"[[Getting Away with Murder (song)|Getting Away with Murder]]\", \"[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]\", \"[[Forever (Papa Roach song)|Forever]]\", \"[[Lifeline (Papa Roach song)|Lifeline]]\", and \"[[Face Everything and Rise (song)|Face Everything and Rise]]\".<!--, among others-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1993\u20131995)===\nPapa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]] and drummer Dave Buckner met on the [[Vacaville High School]] football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist [[Jerry Horton]] from nearby [[Vanden High School]], trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James.<reF>[https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-infest-made-papa-roach-superstars/ Kerrang source]</reF> They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s song \"[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]\". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig they could get. Their first tour van was called Moby Dick, where Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name \"Coby Dick\". The band chose the name Papa Roach from the nickname of Shaddix's step-grandfather, Howard William Roatch.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| date       = December 2000\n| title      = No Way Home\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=aPe2ZKjsEBIC&lpg=PT33&dq=vol%2016%20%200886-3032&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=roatch&f=false\n| magazine   = Spin Magazine\n}}</ref>\nIn 1994, Papa Roach released their first [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending the year in [[Seattle]] studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled ''Caca Bonita''. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp would limit the band's summer practicing and touring.\n\n===''Old Friends from Young Years'' and record deal (1996\u20131999)===\n{{Main|Old Friends from Young Years}}\n[[file:Papa Roach - Rock am Ring 2015-9782.jpg|thumb|Lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]].]]\nOn February 4, 1997, the band produced their debut studio album, entitled ''[[Old Friends from Young Years]]''. Still touring heavily, they supported bands such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Hed PE]], [[Snot (band)|Snot]], [[Far (band)|Far]], and [[Static-X]].\n\nIn 1998, they released an EP titled ''[[5 Tracks Deep]]''. It sold more than 1,000 copies in its first month of release. In 1999, they produced another EP, which would end up being their last independent release, titled ''[[Let 'Em Know]]''. Its success caught the attention of [[Warner Music Group]], who as part of a development deal provided a small amount of money for the production of a five-track promo-demo CD.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html \"Interview With Jay Baumgardner\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017122140/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html |date=2012-10-17 }}, ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 25 Apr 2005.</ref> The band decided they wanted influential rock producer [[Jay Baumgardner]] on board to produce the record.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Baumgardner said, \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club - I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that\u2019s when I realized that they definitely had potential.\u201d<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. was not impressed with the demo, and elected not to sign them.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The unreleased disc included the songs \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\", and \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\".\n\nSoon after, [[DreamWorks Records]] offered the band a recording contract.\n\n===Mainstream success, ''Infest, Lovehatetragedy'' and ''Getting Away With Murder'' (2000\u20132005)===\n[[file:Papa Roach 2006.jpg|thumb|The band in 2006. from left to right: Dave Buckner, Tobin Esperance, Jacoby Shaddix, Jerry Horton]]\nAfter signing with DreamWorks Records in October 1999, they immediately entered the studio to record their major-label debut  album titled ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.27.00/edge-0017.html|title=Metroactive Music - The Edge|website=www.metroactive.com|accessdate=10 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725232838/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.27.00/edge-0017.html|archivedate=25 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://76.12.46.30/interviews/2000/paparoach.htm|title=Interview with Tobin Esperance of Papa Roach (NY Rock)|website=76.12.46.30|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref> The album included old songs from their independent releases, these being \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\" from the Warner Bros. demo CD; \"Revenge In Japanese\" as \"Revenge\" and \"Thrown Away\" from their ''5 Tracks Deep'' EP; \"Legacy\", \"Binge\", \"Snakes\", and a softer version of the originally heavier \"Tightrope\" from the ''[[Let 'Em Know]]'' EP; which were re-recorded, and three additional newly written songs: \"[[Between Angels and Insects|Obsession]]\" (later known as \"Between Angels and Insects\"), \"Blood Brothers\", and \"Never Enough\".

The conflict was initiated after Ottoman officials imprisoned 16 Qatari tribal leaders and ordered a column of troops to march toward the [[House of Thani|Al Thani]] stronghold in the village of [[Al Wajbah]] in response to [[kaymakam]] [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani|Jassim Al Thani]]'s refusal to come to Ottoman authority.<ref name=\"rahman1\">H. Rahman (2006), p. 140</ref>\n\nThe main battle took place in [[Al Wajbah Fort]]. After the Ottomans' unsuccessful attempt at seizing the fort, they retreated first to Shebaka Fort, and then to their fort in [[Al Bidda]]. Shortly after, Al Thani's troop besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighborhood, resulting in the concession of defeat by the Ottomans. Following this was an agreement to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.<ref name=\"rahman2\">H. Rahman (2006), p. 152</ref>\n\nAlthough Qatar did not gain full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the result of the battle is seen by Qatar as a defining moment in the establishment of Qatar as a modern state and the Ottoman's rule was over in Qatar.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>\n\n==Background==\nBeginning in the late 19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] started campaigning to incorporate the provinces of [[Eastern Arabia]] into their empire. After establishing themselves on [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] coast, they advanced towards Qatar, which had come to serve as a base of operations for [[Bedouin]]s who opposed Ottoman rule. In 1871, in an attempt to secure a landing for Ottoman troops, they sent an envoy bearing an Ottoman flag to the proclaimed ruler of the Qatari Peninsula, [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani]]. He accepted and flew the flag, and by December of that year had authorised the Ottomans to send military equipment and 100 troops to [[Al Bidda]].<ref name=\"rahman1\"/> In January 1872, Qatar was formally incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as a province in [[Najd Sanjak|Najd]] with Al Thani being appointed its [[kaymakam]] (sub-governor). Most Qataris were allowed to retain their previous positions in the new administration.<ref name=\"rahman1\"/>\n\nDespite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting Ottoman rule. However, Qatari-Ottoman relations soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of [[Abu Dhabi]]-occupied [[Khawr al Udayd]].<ref name=\"rahman3\"/> Al Thani fell out of favour with the Ottomans after they received complaints from Qataris regarding [[Al Ghariyah#History|his oppressions]] from 1885 to 1886.<ref>F. Anscombe (1997), p. 87</ref> In a further blow to bilateral relations, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888.<ref name=\"rahman3\">H. Rahman (2006), pp. 143\u2013144</ref>\n\nIn 1890, the Ottomans attempted to further consolidate their influence over Qatar by imposing numerous administrative reforms, increasing taxes and stationing additional troops in their garrison at Al Bidda. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, who he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.<ref>H. Rahman (2006), pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Negotiations===\nIn October 1892, an Ottoman army comprising approximately 200 men led by the governor of Basra, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha, was sent to Qatar in response to Al Thani's transgressions.<ref name=\"althani1\">M. Althani (2013), pp. 101\u2013102</ref> They arrived in February 1893, with further reinforcements en route from [[Kuwait]]. Al Thani, fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, fled first to [[Al Daayen]],<ref name=\"qatarqa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.qatar.qa/english/qatar/elwagbabattle|title=Al-Wajba Battle|publisher=qatar.qa|accessdate=24 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725020806/http://www.qatar.qa/english/qatar/elwagbabattle|archive-date=25 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and then to [[Al Wajbah Fort]] (10&nbsp;miles west of [[Doha]]) where he was accompanied by several Qatari tribes.<ref name=\"said1\"/>\n\nMehmed sent a letter to Al Thani demanding that he disband his troops and pledge loyalty to the Ottomans. However, Al Thani remained adamant in his refusal to comply with Ottoman authority, and, additionally, refused to meet with Mehmed himself on the basis of ill health. Instead, he appointed his brother, Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Thani, as his emissary.

The conflict was initiated after Ottoman officials imprisoned 16 Qatari tribal leaders and ordered a column of troops to march toward the [[House of Thani|Al Thani]] stronghold in the village of [[Al Wajbah]] in response to [[kaymakam]] [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani|Jassim Al Thani]]'s refusal to come to Ottoman authority.<ref name=\"rahman1\">H. Rahman (2006), p. 140</ref>\n\nThe main battle took place in [[Al Wajbah Fort]]. After the Ottomans' unsuccessful attempt at seizing the fort, they retreated first to Shebaka Fort, and then to their fort in [[Al Bidda]]. Shortly after, Al Thani's troop besieged the fortress and cut off the water supply of the neighborhood, resulting in the concession of defeat by the Ottomans. Following this was an agreement to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.<ref name=\"rahman2\">H. Rahman (2006), p. 152</ref>\n\nAlthough Qatar did not gain full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the result of the battle is seen by Qatar as a defining moment in the establishment of Qatar as a modern state and the Ottoman's rule was over in Qatar.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>\n\n==Background==\nBeginning in the late 19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] started campaigning to incorporate the provinces of [[Eastern Arabia]] into their empire. After establishing themselves on [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] coast, they advanced towards Qatar, which had come to serve as a base of operations for [[Bedouin]]s who opposed Ottoman rule. In 1871, in an attempt to secure a landing for Ottoman troops, they sent an envoy bearing an Ottoman flag to the proclaimed ruler of the Qatari Peninsula, [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani]]. He accepted and flew the flag, and by December of that year had authorised the Ottomans to send military equipment and 100 troops to [[Al Bidda]].<ref name=\"rahman1\"/> In January 1872, Qatar was formally incorporated into the Ottoman Empire as a province in [[Najd Sanjak|Najd]] with Al Thani being appointed its [[kaymakam]] (sub-governor). Most Qataris were allowed to retain their previous positions in the new administration.<ref name=\"rahman1\"/>\n\nDespite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting Ottoman rule. However, Qatari-Ottoman relations soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of [[Abu Dhabi]]-occupied [[Khawr al Udayd]].<ref name=\"rahman3\"/> Al Thani fell out of favour with the Ottomans after they received complaints from Qataris regarding [[Al Ghariyah#History|his oppressions]] from 1885 to 1886.<ref>F. Anscombe (1997), p. 87</ref> In a further blow to bilateral relations, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888.<ref name=\"rahman3\">H. Rahman (2006), pp. 143\u2013144</ref>\n\nIn 1890, the Ottomans attempted to further consolidate their influence over Qatar by imposing numerous administrative reforms, increasing taxes and stationing additional troops in their garrison at Al Bidda. This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, who he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.<ref>H. Rahman (2006), pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Negotiations===\nIn October 1892, an Ottoman army comprising approximately 201 men led by the governor of Basra, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha, was sent to Qatar in response to Al Thani's transgressions.<ref name=\"althani1\">M. Althani (2013), pp. 101\u2013102</ref> They arrived in February 1893, with further reinforcements en route from [[Kuwait]].

However, Al Thani remained adamant in his refusal to comply with Ottoman authority, and, additionally, refused to meet with Mehmed himself on the basis of ill health. Instead, he appointed his brother, Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Thani, as his emissary.

A [[concept album]], it was inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers in the creation of his music. Idol based the album on the [[cyberdelic]] subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt to take control of the creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chaoscontrol.com/content_article.php?article=billyidol |title=Billy Idol |accessdate=12 August 2008 |last=Gourley |first=Bob |work=Chaos Control Digizine |publisher=Bob Gourley |year=1993 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009124523/http://www.chaoscontrol.com/content_article.php?article=billyidol |archivedate = 9 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe album featured a [[cyberpunk]]-styled narrative, as well as [[Speech synthesis|synthesized vocals]] and [[Industrial rock|industrial]] influences.

Rabin introduced Idol to his home studio, which was centralised around Rabin's [[Macintosh]] computer and music software. The ability to personally produce music from his home, rather than at a professional studio, appealed to Idol's \"[[do it yourself]]\" ethic.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> He felt that working through a team of producers and sound engineers cut into his personal vision for previous albums, and was interested in being more directly in control of his future work. Idol asked his producer, Robin Hancock, to educate himself and his guitarist, Mark Younger-Smith, on the use of software for musical production.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/>\n\nWith his increasing exposure to technology and science fiction, Idol decided to base his upcoming album on the cyberpunk genre, and quickly set about educating himself in [[Cyberdelic]] counter culture.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> Idol saw the convergence of affordable technology with the music industry and anticipated its impact on a new era for DIY punk music. \"It's 1993,\" Idol said during a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview. \"I better wake up and be part of it.

He also read Branwyn's ''Beyond Cyberpunk!'' [[HyperCard]] stack, a collection of essays based on fanzines, political tracts, conspiracy theories, and which referred to itself as \"a do-it-yourself guide to the future.\" Idol proceeded to consult with various writers familiar with the computer related magazines, such as ''Mondo 2000'', and ''[[Boing Boing]]''.

And there was a fire raging. There was smoke just pouring across the whole of LA. It was LA burning. And so I just straight quickly wrote the lyrics and sang them three times. What you're hearing on the single 'Shock to the System' is my news reportage of what I'm seeing.\" Idol recalled for a German broadcast. \"We started the album with a riot. So that's really rock and roll.\"<ref name=\"TV Bravo\"/>\n{{external media\n| float  = left\n| video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvFEGbGmPVw A Creative Moment with Tim Leary and Billy Idol]\", Allan Lundell, ''YouTube'', 11 February 2009. Billy Idol is joined by Timothy Leary and other musicians in the process of recording one of the many intermission tracks for the album. Leary's voice in this recording was later used for track number 15 segue.\n}}\nExcited by the [[Do it yourself|DIY]] aspects of the production process, Idol took only ten months to record the album, which he often contrasted with the combined period of eight years it took to create his two previous albums. Working with his computer over time also gave him the sense that the computer was itself an instrument, and that the performer's style was also presented by the technology. Its versatility also allowed him to switch roles with Mark Younger-Smith and Robin Hancock, allowing each to experiment with their different talents and blurring the lines of their specialised roles, leading Idol to repeatedly compare the production process to that of being in a [[Garage rock|garage band]]. Keyboards were also used to drive much of the music through the album.<ref name=\"Hauk\"/> Together, the trio comprised what Idol considered to be the \"core\" production group, although a number of artists contributed to a various tracks. In particular, he credited his drummer Tal Bergman and bassist [[Doug Wimbish]] for their contributions to numerous tracks. Wimbish had recorded his work from a studio in New York City, and sent it to Los Angeles for use in the production.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/><ref name=\"Gordon\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n''Cyberpunk'' was a departure from Idol's previous style of pop-rock music. Several spoken or sound-effect segues were placed between the album tracks to create a linear narrative. The effect of these segues caused the album to become a [[concept album]]. Karen Schoemer, of the New York Times, commented that \"[w]ith its booming techno beats, screeching guitar riffs, sampled computer voices and songs like 'Power Junkie' ('I feel tonight we're bought and sold/Ah yeah, I think I'll overload'), the album functions as Mr. Idol's interpretation of cyber culture.\"<ref name=\"Schoemer\"/>\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =Billy and I were both really influenced by 'Neuromancer'...

With the computers of the '90s, Idol finally felt that the technology was able to quickly and easily make changes as he saw fit. Idol came to expound on his belief in their future importance for the music industry, and quoting Gareth Branwyn, referred to the computer as \"the new cool tool.\"<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/>\n\nHowever, he rejected the idea of referring to the music as \"computerized\", on the grounds that nothing was done for the album that couldn't have been done with standard recording equipment, and that the computer had simply sped up and simplified the creative process. Placing emphasis on the contribution of the performers over the computer tools they used, Idol felt the album achieved a \"garage band\" spirit, that had captured the \"[[Sturm und Drang]]\" he found in [[rock and roll]], and had simply modified it digitally. Idol thus felt that the album could be best identified as a rock album, rather than a techno album.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> Idol later agreed with an interviewer who commented that the album's digital production and themes were ahead of their time.<ref name=\"Hauk\"/>\n<!--\n\"Later in his career, Idol took that same creative initiative by aggressively looking at how emerging technology would and could affect the general public, and specifically pop culture. Idol shaped his 1993 concept album, Cyberpunk, around pop music's expanding infatuation with modern technology and, in particular, human-computer interactions. While the album wasn't exactly a hit with critics, it's hard to deny that at the time, Idol was ahead of the curve.\"<ref name=\"Downes\"/>\n\n  How to integrate this?\n-->\n\n===Technology===\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =I was always very interested in the Internet...

If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge.

This coincided with Idol's decision to change his fashion style to match the cyberpunk aesthetic of the album.

The [[HyperCard]] stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the ''Cyberpunk'' album as a special edition [[digipak]] feature.<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid for the job of producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by [[Jaime Levy]] at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of ''Electronic Hollywood'', one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn,<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs \u2013 which were not yet compiled into CD format \u2013 for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.<ref name=\"Levy\">{{cite interview |last=Levy |first=Jaime |interviewer=Kevin Walker |work=Interface NYC |location=New York City |date=January 1994 |url=http://www.exhibitresearch.com/kevin/nyc/levy/index.html |title=Interview with Kevin Walker |accessdate=28 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005070236/http://www.exhibitresearch.com/kevin/nyc/levy/index.html |archive-date=5 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =CD-ROM, which allows computers to supersede compact disc players, is the next step for savvy musicians on the cutting edge.\n | source =Julie Romandetta<ref name=\"Romandetta\"/>\n | width  =30%\n | align  =left\n}}\nThe special edition [[Floppy disk|diskette]], a [[Macintosh]] press kit entitled \"Billy Idol's Cyberpunk\", was an industry first.<ref name=\"Appelo\"/> It included album clip art, sample sound bytes, a biography by Mark Frauenfelder, lyrics, and a cyberculture bibliography by Gareth Branwyn.<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> Frauenfelder appeared on a segment of MTV News to describe the diskette's features.<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> Plans were considered by EMI/Chrysalis to re-release the album in the following fall with an updated [[CD-ROM]] if the album was successful.<ref name=\"Romandetta\"/> As CD-ROMs were prohibitively expensive at the time of production, this was anticipated as a potential benchmark event for the music industry.<ref name=\"Saunders\"/> However, this failed to materialise due to the critical and financial failure of the album.\n\n===Computer graphic design===\n[[File:Mark frauenfelder.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mark Frauenfelder]] was among several writers Idol consulted to learn about cyberculture.

This included its use for the album and singles' cover art, the ''Billy Idol's Cyberpunk'' floppy disk, and in the press pack released to the media.\n\nFrauenfelder worked with [[Adobe Photoshop]], while Idol was present for the design process to provide suggestions.

Brett Leonard. Billy Idol.  ERG Video & Chrysalis Group. 29 June 1993</ref>\n\n===1993 No Religion Tour===\nTo promote the release of ''Cyberpunk'', Idol began the 1993 ''No Religion Tour''. The title of the tour came from a lyric in the album's first track, \"Wasteland\", which described a man travelling through a dystopia. In keeping with the album's theme, the performance stages were set to a computerised, high-tech aesthetic. Idol wished to use Blendo imagery on massive television screens behind the stage to rapidly shift in time with the music.<ref name=\"Appelo\"/> Some of the video and photography was shot by Idol and [[Brett Leonard]], including photos of Idol during acupuncture, himself at a spa, various LA landscapes, and imagery which referenced heroin use.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> An engineer on stage, whom Idol fashioned as another band member, would be charged with altering the images in rhythm with the music, as though it were also an instrument. Multiple engineers with video equipment would also roam the audience, beaming images of the crowd onto the screen as well, creating an interactive show.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> The tour took place in Europe, performing a total of 19 shows in 18 cities across 11 countries. It began on 18 August 1993 in [[Berlin]], and concluded on 20 September 1993 in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billyidol.com/ |title=1993 No Religion Tour |accessdate=12 August 2008 |work=Billyidol.com |publisher=The Billy Idol Fan Club }}</ref>\n\nIdol hoped to advance the way [[stagecraft]] and [[Stage lighting|lighting]] were used at [[rock concert]]s. \"Part of the idea is to create an element of visible language,\" Idol explained during an interview with the ''New York Times'', \"so that you feel as if you're being talked to through images. I think you have to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge.\"<ref name=\"Schoemer\"/>\n\n===Music videos===\nThree of four ''Cyberpunk'' singles were promoted by music videos: \"Heroin\", \"Shock to the System\", and \"Adam in Chains\". The fourth single, \"Wasteland\", did not receive a music video.\n\nThe first single, \"Heroin\", was accompanied with the most music videos, with a total of five for several different remixed versions of the cover. Each was a \"Blendo\" video which rapidly shifted random imagery and colours in time with the music. Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to [[Howard Deutch]]. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a \"do-it-yourself\" message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. \"We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say you can make your own videos, and you don't always have to do it in a very ''MTV'' way.\"<ref name=\"TV Bravo\"/> None were released for rotation on television; instead, one was included in the video album release, ''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System''.<ref name=\"Blendo\"/>\n\nA \"blendo\" video was also produced for \"Shock to the System\", being included in the ''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System'' VHS cassette.<ref name=\"VHS\"/>\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx2fZU5USus Shock to the System]\", [[EMI America Records]], ''YouTube'', 9 March 2009.\n}}\nThe second single, \"Shock to the System\", which was inspired by the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], received the first music video put into MTV rotation. As Idol explained for MTV News, he had originally created the song with an entirely different set of lyrics, but upon witnessing the riots on television he immediately rewrote and recorded them that day.<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> Idol explained that he was trying to capture the political and economic conflict that had created the LA Riots. Idol further felt that the [[camcorder]] \u2013 as displayed in the witnessing of the [[Rodney King|Rodney King beating]] \u2013 was a \"potent way of conveying ideas\" and an important metaphor for technology used in rebellion.<ref name=\"VHS\"/>\n\nThe music video was set in a dystopian future controlled by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director [[Brett Leonard]].)<ref name=\"VHS\"/> It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be noticed and attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.\n\nThe make-up effects were achieved through [[stop motion]], with Billy Idol moving in slow stages during points of the filming, allowing the make up effects to gradually cover more of his body to create the illusion of metamorphosis. [[Stan Winston]], who had previously worked on the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', supervised and created the special effects for the video. The music video for \"Shock to the System\" was nominated for \"Best Special Effects in a Video\" and \"Best Editing in a Video\" at the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]], losing both times to [[Peter Gabriel]]'s video for \"[[Steam (Peter Gabriel song)|Steam]]\".\n\nThe final music video, \"Adam in Chains\", was directed by [[Julien Temple]]. It depicted Billy Idol being bound into a chair as he is monitored by scientists. He struggles before being hypnotised, and is then inserted into a [[virtual reality]] simulator. There he is treated to an ethereal water fantasy. Idol eventually rejects the fantasy, which is consumed in flames as, in the real world, his body violently convulses. The scientists end the experiment and Idol is brought back into reality, only to fall unconscious.\n\n===''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System''===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Cyberpunk: Shock to the System\n| type       = Video\n| artist     = [[Billy Idol]]\n| cover      = Cyberpunk- Shock to the System.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = ''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System'' box cover.{{Clear}}  The tagline reads: \"Outlaw Tech.

His interpretation of the discussions led him to dub the reactions of alt.cyberpunk the \"Panic of '93\".

Billy Idol's own official fansite was established in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billyidol.com/ |title=Latest News 2008 |accessdate=12 August 2008 |work=Billyidol.com |publisher=The Billy Idol Fan Club }}</ref> In 2010, Idol continued to pursue his early vision for the integration of his tours with technology by utilising his website to document a world tour through a blog and streaming video feed. \"These days, [Idol] sees his own website as his old vision of the future becoming reality.\"<ref name=\"Downes\"/>\n\nThe inclusion of multimedia software as a special feature was a novelty when Chrysalis Records released the ''Billy Idol's Cyberpunk'' diskette.<ref name=\"Appelo\"/> This was also widely adopted by the music industry years later.<ref name=\"Appelo\"/> [[CD-ROM]]s were initially considered as a medium for ''Cyberpunk'''s multimedia features, but were too expensive at the time of production, and so floppy disks were used instead. [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Todd Rundgren]] had previously experimented with CD-ROMs, but it was hoped that if Idol's album had proved popular, it could have been reissued with CD-ROMs, catapulting the format into the music industry's mainstream.<ref name=\"Saunders\"/> This never materialised due to the album's general failures. However, during the late '90s it became increasingly common for some limited edition [[digipak]]s to include CD-ROMs, evolving by the early 2000s into the inclusion of DVDs.\n\n==Track

A [[concept album]], it was inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers in the creation of his music. Idol based the album on the [[cyberdelic]] subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt to take control of the creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chaoscontrol.com/content_article.php?article=billyidol |title=Billy Idol |accessdate=12 August 2008 |last=Gourley |first=Bob |work=Chaos Control Digizine |publisher=Bob Gourley |year=1993 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009124523/http://www.chaoscontrol.com/content_article.php?article=billyidol |archivedate = 9 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe album featured a [[cyberpunk]]-styled narrative, as well as [[Speech synthesis|synthesized vocals]] and [[Industrial rock|industrial]] influences.

Rabin introduced Idol to his home studio, which was centralised around Rabin's [[Macintosh]] computer and music software. The ability to personally produce music from his home, rather than at a professional studio, appealed to Idol's \"[[do it yourself]]\" ethic.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> He felt that working through a team of producers and sound engineers cut into his personal vision for previous albums, and was interested in being more directly in control of his future work. Idol asked his producer, Robin Hancock, to educate himself and his guitarist, Mark Younger-Smith, on the use of software for musical production.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/>\n\nWith his increasing exposure to technology and science fiction, Idol decided to base his upcoming album on the cyberpunk genre, and quickly set about educating himself in [[Cyberdelic]] counter culture.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> Idol saw the convergence of affordable technology with the music industry and anticipated its impact on a new era for DIY punk music. \"It's 1993,\" Idol said during a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview. \"I better wake up and be part of it.

He also read Branwyn's ''Beyond Cyberpunk!'' [[HyperCard]] stack, a collection of essays based on fanzines, political tracts, conspiracy theories, and which referred to itself as \"a do-it-yourself guide to the future.\" Idol proceeded to consult with various writers familiar with the computer related magazines, such as ''Mondo 2000'', and ''[[Boing Boing]]''. Idol also hosted a \"cyber-meeting\" attended by the likes of [[Timothy Leary]], famed counterculture guru; [[Jaime Levy]], author of books published on disks under the \"Electronic Hollywood\" imprint; [[R. U. Sirius]], co-founder of ''Mondo 2000''; and [[Brett Leonard]], director of ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]''.<ref name=\"Saunders\"/>\n\nAsked by Idol about how he could become further involved in [[cyberculture]], Branwyn and [[Mark Frauenfelder]] advised him to investigate [[The WELL]], one of the oldest [[Virtual community|online communities]].<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> Idol did so, discussing the album project online with WELL users, and creating a personal e-mail account which he released on printed advertisements for the upcoming album, so that fans could communicate with him.{{Ref label|A|I|none}} Idol also made occasional postings to alt.cyberpunk, a [[Usenet]] newsgroup.

And there was a fire raging. There was smoke just pouring across the whole of LA. It was LA burning. And so I just straight quickly wrote the lyrics and sang them three times. What you're hearing on the single 'Shock to the System' is my news reportage of what I'm seeing.\" Idol recalled for a German broadcast. \"We started the album with a riot. So that's really rock and roll.\"<ref name=\"TV Bravo\"/>\n{{external media\n| float  = left\n| video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvFEGbGmPVw A Creative Moment with Tim Leary and Billy Idol]\", Allan Lundell, ''YouTube'', 11 February 2009. Billy Idol is joined by Timothy Leary and other musicians in the process of recording one of the many intermission tracks for the album. Leary's voice in this recording was later used for track number 15 segue.\n}}\nExcited by the [[Do it yourself|DIY]] aspects of the production process, Idol took only ten months to record the album, which he often contrasted with the combined period of eight years it took to create his two previous albums. Working with his computer over time also gave him the sense that the computer was itself an instrument, and that the performer's style was also presented by the technology. Its versatility also allowed him to switch roles with Mark Younger-Smith and Robin Hancock, allowing each to experiment with their different talents and blurring the lines of their specialised roles, leading Idol to repeatedly compare the production process to that of being in a [[Garage rock|garage band]]. Keyboards were also used to drive much of the music through the album.<ref name=\"Hauk\"/> Together, the trio comprised what Idol considered to be the \"core\" production group, although a number of artists contributed to a various tracks. In particular, he credited his drummer Tal Bergman and bassist [[Doug Wimbish]] for their contributions to numerous tracks. Wimbish had recorded his work from a studio in New York City, and sent it to Los Angeles for use in the production.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/><ref name=\"Gordon\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n''Cyberpunk'' was a departure from Idol's previous style of pop-rock music. Several spoken or sound-effect segues were placed between the album tracks to create a linear narrative. The effect of these segues caused the album to become a [[concept album]]. Karen Schoemer, of the New York Times, commented that \"[w]ith its booming techno beats, screeching guitar riffs, sampled computer voices and songs like 'Power Junkie' ('I feel tonight we're bought and sold/Ah yeah, I think I'll overload'), the album functions as Mr. Idol's interpretation of cyber culture.\"<ref name=\"Schoemer\"/>\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =Billy and I were both really influenced by 'Neuromancer'...

With the computers of the '90s, Idol finally felt that the technology was able to quickly and easily make changes as he saw fit. Idol came to expound on his belief in their future importance for the music industry, and quoting Gareth Branwyn, referred to the computer as \"the new cool tool.\"<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/>\n\nHowever, he rejected the idea of referring to the music as \"computerized\", on the grounds that nothing was done for the album that couldn't have been done with standard recording equipment, and that the computer had simply sped up and simplified the creative process. Placing emphasis on the contribution of the performers over the computer tools they used, Idol felt the album achieved a \"garage band\" spirit, that had captured the \"[[Sturm und Drang]]\" he found in [[rock and roll]], and had simply modified it digitally. Idol thus felt that the album could be best identified as a rock album, rather than a techno album.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> Idol later agreed with an interviewer who commented that the album's digital production and themes were ahead of their time.<ref name=\"Hauk\"/>\n<!--\n\"Later in his career, Idol took that same creative initiative by aggressively looking at how emerging technology would and could affect the general public, and specifically pop culture. Idol shaped his 1993 concept album, Cyberpunk, around pop music's expanding infatuation with modern technology and, in particular, human-computer interactions. While the album wasn't exactly a hit with critics, it's hard to deny that at the time, Idol was ahead of the curve.\"<ref name=\"Downes\"/>\n\n  How to integrate this?\n-->\n\n===Technology===\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =I was always very interested in the Internet...

If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back.\"<ref name=\"Appelo\"/>\n\n===Fashion===\nOn 24 September 1992, Billy Idol took part in a benefit fashion show by [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]].\n<ref name=\"EW review\">{{cite journal |first=|last=|authorlink=|title=They Wear It Well|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312050,00.html|journal=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |issue=139 |location=United States |date=9 October 1992 |accessdate=13 July 2009}}</ref> The event, entitled the \"Jean Paul Gaultier in L.A.\", was a fashion benefit for [[amfAR]] AIDS research, at the [[Shrine Auditorium]].<ref>Crampton, Luke, et al. \"BILLY IDOL.\" ''Encyclopedia of Rock Stars''.

This coincided with Idol's decision to change his fashion style to match the cyberpunk aesthetic of the album. Idol changed his hair to [[dreadlocks]], and wore sleek, futuristic clothing by New York fashion designer [[Stephen Sprouse]]. In a photo shoot published in ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' July 1993 issue, highlighting Billy Idol's new \"cyberpunk\" aesthetic, Idol modelled in a distressed-velvet jacket and matching trousers designed by [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]].

The [[HyperCard]] stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the ''Cyberpunk'' album as a special edition [[digipak]] feature.<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid for the job of producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by [[Jaime Levy]] at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of ''Electronic Hollywood'', one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn,<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs \u2013 which were not yet compiled into CD format \u2013 for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.<ref name=\"Levy\">{{cite interview |last=Levy |first=Jaime |interviewer=Kevin Walker |work=Interface NYC |location=New York City |date=January 1994 |url=http://www.exhibitresearch.com/kevin/nyc/levy/index.html |title=Interview with Kevin Walker |accessdate=28 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005070236/http://www.exhibitresearch.com/kevin/nyc/levy/index.html |archive-date=5 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =CD-ROM, which allows computers to supersede compact disc players, is the next step for savvy musicians on the cutting edge.\n | source =Julie Romandetta<ref name=\"Romandetta\"/>\n | width  =30%\n | align  =left\n}}\nThe special edition [[Floppy disk|diskette]], a [[Macintosh]] press kit entitled \"Billy Idol's Cyberpunk\", was an industry first.<ref name=\"Appelo\"/> It included album clip art, sample sound bytes, a biography by Mark Frauenfelder, lyrics, and a cyberculture bibliography by Gareth Branwyn.<ref name=\"Branwyn\"/> Frauenfelder appeared on a segment of MTV News to describe the diskette's features.<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> Plans were considered by EMI/Chrysalis to re-release the album in the following fall with an updated [[CD-ROM]] if the album was successful.<ref name=\"Romandetta\"/> As CD-ROMs were prohibitively expensive at the time of production, this was anticipated as a potential benchmark event for the music industry.<ref name=\"Saunders\"/> However, this failed to materialise due to the critical and financial failure of the album.\n\n===Computer graphic design===\n[[File:Mark frauenfelder.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mark Frauenfelder]] was among several writers Idol consulted to learn about cyberculture.

This included its use for the album and singles' cover art, the ''Billy Idol's Cyberpunk'' floppy disk, and in the press pack released to the media.\n\nFrauenfelder worked with [[Adobe Photoshop]], while Idol was present for the design process to provide suggestions.

The title of the tour came from a lyric in the album's first track, \"Wasteland\", which described a man travelling through a dystopia. In keeping with the album's theme, the performance stages were set to a computerised, high-tech aesthetic. Idol wished to use Blendo imagery on massive television screens behind the stage to rapidly shift in time with the music.<ref name=\"Appelo\"/> Some of the video and photography was shot by Idol and [[Brett Leonard]], including photos of Idol during acupuncture, himself at a spa, various LA landscapes, and imagery which referenced heroin use.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> An engineer on stage, whom Idol fashioned as another band member, would be charged with altering the images in rhythm with the music, as though it were also an instrument. Multiple engineers with video equipment would also roam the audience, beaming images of the crowd onto the screen as well, creating an interactive show.<ref name=\"Chaos Control\"/> The tour took place in Europe, performing a total of 19 shows in 18 cities across 11 countries. It began on 18 August 1993 in [[Berlin]], and concluded on 20 September 1993 in London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billyidol.com/ |title=1993 No Religion Tour |accessdate=12 August 2008 |work=Billyidol.com |publisher=The Billy Idol Fan Club }}</ref>\n\nIdol hoped to advance the way [[stagecraft]] and [[Stage lighting|lighting]] were used at [[rock concert]]s. \"Part of the idea is to create an element of visible language,\" Idol explained during an interview with the ''New York Times'', \"so that you feel as if you're being talked to through images. I think you have to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge.\"<ref name=\"Schoemer\"/>\n\n===Music videos===\nThree of four ''Cyberpunk'' singles were promoted by music videos: \"Heroin\", \"Shock to the System\", and \"Adam in Chains\". The fourth single, \"Wasteland\", did not receive a music video.\n\nThe first single, \"Heroin\", was accompanied with the most music videos, with a total of five for several different remixed versions of the cover. Each was a \"Blendo\" video which rapidly shifted random imagery and colours in time with the music. Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to [[Howard Deutch]]. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a \"do-it-yourself\" message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. \"We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say you can make your own videos, and you don't always have to do it in a very ''MTV'' way.\"<ref name=\"TV Bravo\"/> None were released for rotation on television; instead, one was included in the video album release, ''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System''.<ref name=\"Blendo\"/>\n\nA \"blendo\" video was also produced for \"Shock to the System\", being included in the ''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System'' VHS cassette.<ref name=\"VHS\"/>\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx2fZU5USus Shock to the System]\", [[EMI America Records]], ''YouTube'', 9 March 2009.\n}}\nThe second single, \"Shock to the System\", which was inspired by the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], received the first music video put into MTV rotation. As Idol explained for MTV News, he had originally created the song with an entirely different set of lyrics, but upon witnessing the riots on television he immediately rewrote and recorded them that day.<ref name=\"MTV News\"/> Idol explained that he was trying to capture the political and economic conflict that had created the LA Riots. Idol further felt that the [[camcorder]] \u2013 as displayed in the witnessing of the [[Rodney King|Rodney King beating]] \u2013 was a \"potent way of conveying ideas\" and an important metaphor for technology used in rebellion.<ref name=\"VHS\"/>\n\nThe music video was set in a dystopian future controlled by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director [[Brett Leonard]].)<ref name=\"VHS\"/> It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be noticed and attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on the ground, as they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.\n\nThe make-up effects were achieved through [[stop motion]], with Billy Idol moving in slow stages during points of the filming, allowing the make up effects to gradually cover more of his body to create the illusion of metamorphosis. [[Stan Winston]], who had previously worked on the ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', supervised and created the special effects for the video. The music video for \"Shock to the System\" was nominated for \"Best Special Effects in a Video\" and \"Best Editing in a Video\" at the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]], losing both times to [[Peter Gabriel]]'s video for \"[[Steam (Peter Gabriel song)|Steam]]\".\n\nThe final music video, \"Adam in Chains\", was directed by [[Julien Temple]]. It depicted Billy Idol being bound into a chair as he is monitored by scientists. He struggles before being hypnotised, and is then inserted into a [[virtual reality]] simulator. There he is treated to an ethereal water fantasy. Idol eventually rejects the fantasy, which is consumed in flames as, in the real world, his body violently convulses. The scientists end the experiment and Idol is brought back into reality, only to fall unconscious.\n\n===''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System''===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Cyberpunk: Shock to the System\n| type       = Video\n| artist     = [[Billy Idol]]\n| cover      = Cyberpunk- Shock to the System.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = ''Cyberpunk: Shock to the System'' box cover.{{Clear}}  The tagline reads: \"Outlaw Tech.

After he waited for three cement trucks to pass, a fourth truck, previously blocked by opposing traffic, struck him. He went under the first two wheels of the 42-ton truck and slid 500 feet. He was knocked unconscious, suffered [[acute shock]], and fell into a coma. He was rushed to [[intensive care]], where he woke up two weeks later. He had broken all the bones in both of his legs, had a [[collapsed lung]], developed multiple infections, and it was unknown whether he would ever walk again. Over several years, he had 26 surgeries and spent much of the time using a wheelchair. Due to the extent of his injuries, DeVine was at very high risk of having to have his legs amputated, and having [[multiple organ failure]]. It was later discovered that the reason he was not killed was because his bike took the full force of the truck.<ref name=\"ketv.com\"/>\n\nDeVine regained full mobility but still has extensive scarring on his legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/adam-devine/bio/324819|title=Adam DeVine Biography|work=[[TV Guide]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115183122/http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/adam-devine/bio/324819|archivedate=January 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://ew.com/article/2016/07/08/adam-devine-origin-story-getting-hit-cement-truck/|title= Adam Devine's origin story: Getting hit by a cement truck|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Franich|first=Darren|date=July 8, 2016|access-date=March 4, 2020}}</ref> He said of the accident, \"It was really tough because I had to relearn how to walk, stand up, sit up and everything.

Upon returning to school, he experienced bullying, but told jokes as a way to deflect attention away from his injuries. He later said that all of this contributed to how he saw comedy as a way of bringing people together.\n\n==Career==\nIn 2006, DeVine and friends [[Blake Anderson]], [[Anders Holm]], and [[Kyle Newacheck]] formed the sketch-comedy group Mail Order Comedy. Although they toured together live, the group found greater success on websites such as [[Myspace]] and [[YouTube]].

After he waited for three cement trucks to pass, a fourth truck, previously blocked by opposing traffic, struck him. He went under the first two wheels of the 42-ton truck and slid 500 feet. He was knocked unconscious, suffered [[acute shock]], and fell into a coma. He was rushed to [[intensive care]], where he woke up two weeks later. He had broken all the bones in both of his legs, had a [[collapsed lung]], developed multiple infections, and it was unknown whether he would ever walk again.

Due to the extent of his injuries, DeVine was at very high risk of having to have his legs amputated, and having [[multiple organ failure]].

Columbia University Press</ref> The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE. In India, [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]], [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya|Amaravati]] and [[Bharhut]] are among the oldest known stupas.

In [[Sri Lanka]], the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]] includes some of the tallest, most ancient and best preserved stupas in the world, such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]].\n\nThe most elaborate stupa is the 8th century [[Borobudur]] monument in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The upper rounded terrace with rows of bell-shaped stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing [[Ar\u016bpajh\u0101na]], the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of [[Gautama Buddha]].

Sometimes the type is chosen directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.<ref name=\"KUC\">{{cite web | title=Miracle Stupa - Stupa | url=http://www.stupa.pl/en_stupa.html | publisher=stupa.pl | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EndAscetism.JPG|thumb|The sharing of the relics of the Buddha.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Lotus Blossom Stupa===\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\"<ref name=\"Beer\">Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}</ref> (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Nirvana===\nThis stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n==Kalachakra stupa==\n{{Main|Kalachakra stupa}}\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]].

Columbia University Press</ref> The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE.

In [[Sri Lanka]], the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]] includes some of the tallest, most ancient and best preserved stupas in the world, such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]].\n\nThe most elaborate stupa is the 8th century [[Borobudur]] monument in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The upper rounded terrace with rows of bell-shaped stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing [[Ar\u016bpajh\u0101na]], the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Lotus Blossom Stupa===\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\"<ref name=\"Beer\">Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}</ref> (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Nirvana===\nThis stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n==Kalachakra stupa==\n{{Main|Kalachakra stupa}}\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]]. Its symbolism is not connected to events in the Buddha's life, but instead to the symbolism of the [[Kalachakra Tantra]], created to protect against negative energies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kalachakra Stupa |url=http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |publisher=karmaguen.org |accessdate=2009-04-18 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205055317/http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Swat District==\n[[Swat District]], Pakistan, is a small place with a large number of ancient stupas.

This effect involves a witness to a crime diverting his or her attention to the weapon the [[perpetrator]] is holding, thus causing [[memory]] impairments and leaving less [[attention]] for other details in the scene, such as the attacker\u2019s face, clothing or vehicle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Steblay|first=Nancy Mehrkens|title=A meta-analytic review of the weapon focus effect.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1992|volume=16 | issue = 4|pages=413\u2013424|url=http://web.augsburg.edu/~steblay/weaponfocusmetaanalysis.pdf|doi=10.1007/bf02352267}}</ref>\n\nSeveral studies support the notion of weapon focus, particularly in terms of greater attention paid to the weapon and its effects on recognition and recall.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adult Eyewitness Testimony: Current Trends and Developments|last=Ross|first=David Frank|last2=Read|first2=J.

As for the reason of the [[phenomenon]], the two leading explanations attribute it to the [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[arousal]] of the witness, or to the overall unusualness of the situation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Thomas| last2=Buckhout|first2=Robert| last3=Eugenio|first3=Paul|title=Weapon focus, arousal, and eyewitness memory: Attention must be paid|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1990|volume=14|issue=2|pages=167\u2013184|doi=10.1007/bf01062971}}</ref> \n\nIn one of the earliest known investigations of weapon focus, Johnson and Scott (1976) had two groups of participants come into what they thought was a laboratory study of human [[memory]]. In actuality, they were to take part in a simulated interaction intended to determine whether the presence of a [[weapon]] would influence eyewitness memory for an event. Participants in the control condition sat in a waiting room where they overheard a conversation between two people following which a man exited with greasy hands and a grease pen. In the weapon condition, participants sat in the same waiting room, but instead they heard a violent argument \u2013 including furniture being thrown around \u2013 following which a man came out holding a blood-stained knife. During a photo line-up, the control participants were more likely to accurately identify the man they saw in the waiting room relative to participants in the weapon condition (49% versus 33% correct identifications).<ref name=\"Johnson Scott\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=C.|last2=Scott|first2=B.|title=Eyewitness testimony and suspect identification as a function of arousal, sex or witness and scheduling of interrogation|journal=Paper Presented at the American Psychological Association Annual Meeting|year=1976}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, initially Loftus postulated that it is an expected occurrence in the event where an individual is highly aroused, such as in the case of a frightening situation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology Applied: A Symposium at the 22nd International Congress of Applied Psychology|last=Izawa|first=Chizuko|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0805808308|location=New York|pages=207}}</ref> This suggestion was criticized for its lack of supporting evidence, so its author conducted several studies in 1987 and finally demonstrated the viability of weapon focus.<ref name=\":0\" /> The study conducted by Johnson and Scott (1976) represents one of the few early simulation studies available, likely due to the [[Human subject research|ethical issues]] surrounding the exposure of research participants to a putatively threatening scenario. For this reason much of the research conducted on the weapon focus effect has made use of videos or slide shows.<ref name=\"Johnson Scott\" /> In one of the first such experiments, Loftus, Loftus and Messo (1987) had participants watch a video in which a young man approached the counter of a fast food restaurant, presented an object to the cashier, accepted money and left. In the control condition the man presented a cheque to the cashier whereas in the weapon condition the man presented a gun. Specialized equipment tracked the participant's gaze as they viewed the video to determine with what frequency (and for how long) they fixated upon the item of interest (the cheque or the gun). Relative to the control condition, participants in the weapon condition looked at the item the man was holding more frequently and for greater duration. Further, when tested for the details of the event, performance was better for the control condition relative to the weapon condition - with the exception that participants in the weapon condition were more likely to recall what object the man was holding (a gun).<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|first1=Elizabeth|last1=Loftus|last2=Loftus|first2=Geoffrey Russell| last3=Messos|first3=Jane|title=Some facts about weapon focus|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1987| volume=11 | issue = 1|pages=55\u201362|url= https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01044839| doi=10.1007/bf01044839}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant challenge to the studies on the weapon focus effect has been their [[ecological validity]]. Specifically, many theorists have argued that the effect is limited to the laboratory design. These claims have been supported by the relative absence of applied evidence supporting the effect. Several reports have been published looking for evidence of a weapon focus effect using records of actual crimes. According to the laboratory findings summarized above, the prediction had been that eyewitness memory would be worse for weapon crimes compared to non-weapon crimes. Many primary studies have failed to support this prediction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Karen|last2=Livosky|first2=Marilyn| last3=Mather|first3=Mara|title=The weapon focus effect revisited: The role of novelty|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=287\u2013303|url=http://pantheon.yale.edu/%7Ekm294/1998_Mitchell_Livosky_Mather_LegCrimPsy.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8333.1998.tb00367.x}}</ref> Even so, a recent [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Fawcett et al. (2013) has demonstrated that when the data for all of the applied studies are combined, there ''is'' a small but reliable effect suggesting that weapon presence impairs actual eyewitness memory. This is extremely significant when one considers how jurors tend to overvalue eyewitness testimony.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bornstein, Brian H.

It found that the exposure to firearms was associated with significantly better eyewitness descriptions especially regarding basic features such as gender, height, build, age, and ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychology and Law: A Critical Introduction|last=Kapardis|first=Andreas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521707732|location=Cambridge|pages=52}}</ref>\n\n==Causes of weapon focus==\n\nA leading explanation for a cause of weapons focus is the unusualness of the situation, being a witness to a crime. Since the initial research conducted by Johnson and Scott (1976) and Loftus et al. (1987), others have demonstrated a similar effect using unusual objects rather than weapons. These findings are described as the \"Unusual Item Hypothesis.\" This effect is seen when an object does not fit with the [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of the situation.  Attention is then drawn to the out-of-place object and less attention is paid to other objects in the scene making recalling these other objects more difficult. This effect was observed in Toronto in 1997 when a robber entered a coffee shop and demanded money while threatening to strangle a goose he was holding if the he did not receive the money.  Meanwhile, the customers were too focussed on the strangeness of a goose in the coffee shop to observe any details about the perpetrator himself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fawcett|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Russell|first2=Emily J.|last3=Peace|first3=Kristine A.|last4=Christie|first4=John|date=2013-01-01|title=Of guns and geese: a meta-analytic review of the \u2018weapon focus\u2019 literature|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1068316X.2011.599325|journal=Psychology, Crime & Law|volume=19|issue=1|pages=35\u201366|doi=10.1080/1068316X.2011.599325|issn=1068-316X}}</ref>  This effect has also been observed in the lab. For example, Pickel (1998) demonstrated an effect comparable to weapon focus using a video in which a man approached a cashier and presented a whole raw chicken or miniature [[Pillsbury Dough Boy]] instead of an expected item such as a wallet. From her finding, Pickel (1998) argued that the weapon focus arose from the unusual nature of the object in the relation to the context in which it was presented. \n\nIn their 2013 meta-analysis, Fawcett et al. (2013) presented the issues surrounding the arousal/threat hypothesis. This is one of the oldest explanations connected to the weapon focus phenomenon, and relies on the [[Yerkes\u2013Dodson law|Yerkes-Dodson law]] that links arousal and performance;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yerkes|first=Robert M.|last2=Dodson|first2=John D.|date=1908|title=The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.920180503|journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=459\u2013482|doi=10.1002/cne.920180503|issn=1550-7149}}</ref> emotionally arousing states, such as stress, can enhance performance up to a point, but after this there are detrimental impacts on cognitive functions, like memory and learning. In situations where a weapon is present, witnesses tend to focus on the object of arousal and miss peripheral details, like the identity of the perpetrator. This explanation relies on Easterbrook's (1959) theory that stress causes a reduction in mental resources, thus the range of cues a subject can attend to in this situation will be significantly reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Easterbrook|first=J. A.|date=1959|title=The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/h0047707|journal=Psychological Review|volume=66|issue=3|pages=183\u2013201|doi=10.1037/h0047707|issn=1939-1471}}</ref> In a dangerous situation where a weapon is present, survival becomes the most important facets and peripheral information is overlooked. This means that the witness has a heightened memory for the weapon, but may struggle to recall other information. Over time, research into the role of anxiety on weapon focus has produced inconsistent findings, causing researchers to look at alternative causes of the phenomenon. The relative contributions of both arousal and unusualness remain one of the primary theoretical issues in this literature, with some authors arguing for a contribution of both.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|year=1998|title=Unusualness and threat as possible causes of \"weapon focus\"|journal=Memory|volume=6|issue=3|pages=277\u2013295|doi=10.1080/741942361|pmid=9709443}}</ref>\n\nAnother potential cause of weapon focus is the \"automatic capture\" explanation.  This suggests that the [[attention]] paid to a weapon is automatic and unintentional.  Studies have been performed that show that even if a subject is asked to ignore specific [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] they are unable to, thus indicating an automatic response.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Remington|first1=Roger W.|last2=Johnston|first2=James C.|last3=Yantis|first3=Steven|title=Involuntary attentional capture by abrupt onsets|journal=Perception & Psychophysics|year=1992| volume=51 | issue = 3|pages=279\u2013290|url= http://pbs.jhu.edu/research/Yantis/publications/PDF/Johnston-etal-P-P-1992.pdf|doi=10.3758/bf03212254|pmid=1561053}}</ref>  Remington et al. (1992) conclude that a participant might intend to ignore an event, but their attention is often automatically captured by it - as such, an eyewitness may not intend to solely focus on a weapon, but if their diversion of attention to it cannot be controlled, they possess little ability to ignore it. Yantis and Jonides (1996) suggest that it makes adaptive sense for humans to divert attention towards new objects, as a new representation has to be created for that object, presenting another explanation for the weapon focus phenomenon. However, they also conclude that attention focus is not automatic and can be directed on command, especially if attention is already focused somewhere specific.  If attention is already focused away from a certain stimulus, then automatic capture is avoidable.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yantis|first1=Steven|last2=Jonides|first2=John|title=Attentional Capture by Abrupt Onsets: New Perceptual Objects or Visual Masking?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1996| volume=22 | issue = 6|pages=1505\u20131513|url= http://pbs.jhu.edu/research/Yantis/publications/PDF/yantis_jonides_JEPHPP_1996.pdf|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.22.6.1505}}</ref>\n\n== Individual differences in weapon focus ==\nPickel looked into some differences in the memory of the eyewitnesses, when the physical traits of the perpetrator change. Firstly, the difference in memory was examined between eyewitnesses that saw a white perpetrator versus a black perpetrator. Her research, conducted in 2009, showed that the weapon focus effect weakens with 'black' perpetrators in comparison to 'white' perpetrators, and that the weapon focus effect is not significant when a \"Black perpetrator wore a style of clothing that is strongly associated with Black men\". It is suggested that individuals who observe a black perpetrator who is armed automatically activates a [[stereotype]] that links black men with weapons and crime. As a consequence, this reduces the unusualness of the weapon and increases the likelihood of attracting [[attention]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|last2=Sneyd|first2=Danielle|year=2018|title=The weapon focus effect is weaker with black versus white male perpetrators|journal=Memory|edition=1|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29\u201341|doi=10.1080/09658211.2017.1317814|pmid=28436249}}</ref>.\n\nIn the same year, Pickel also looked at the weapon focus effect on memory for female versus male perpetrators.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri L.|date=2009|title=The weapon focus effect on memory for female versus male perpetrators|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210903029412|journal=Memory|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=664\u2013678|doi=10.1080/09658210903029412|issn=0965-8211|via=}}</ref> The experiments involved participants watching videos that either had a male or female perpetrator, holding either a gun or a neutral object. Overall, the weapon focus effect was strongest when the gun was held by a woman as opposed to a male perpetrator. Participants rated the presence of the gun as more unusual when it was held by a woman versus when it was held by a man, less accurately described the physical traits of the perpetrator when they were holding a gun and the overall memory falsities were greater in the conditions where the gun was held by a female. The presence of the gun in the possession of the female perpetrators was more unexpected, thus participants allocated more of their attention to the weapon over their physical traits. Pickel did, however, find that the weapon focus effect was mitigated when participants were primed and the perpetrators were categorized as dangerous and aggressive.\n\nThese differences in eyewitness memory can be attributed to whether the perpetrator holding a weapon is consistent with the eyewitness's [[Schema (psychology)|schema]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Pickel posits that if the object held by the target falls in line with the witness's schema, they will not divert as much attention to it and the characteristics of the perpetrator will be encoded normally - it is only when the combination of the perpetrator and the object is not consistent with the schema that the weapon focus effect will be significant in distorting memory. In reference to the study mentioned above, a female perpetrator holding a gun violated the participants' schema more than the male perpetrator; the presence of a gun with a man was deemed as less unexpected.\n\nIn light of research recommendations, some more recent research has looked into the individual differences surrounding the weapon focus phenomenon, where not all samples of participants have reacted in the same way to the presence of a weapon, namely children. In some situations, like domestic violence, children can be crucial eyewitnesses, so recent research has looked at the age at which the weapon focus effect becomes influential. One study looked at the impacts of a surprising object on the memory of children, using a syringe filled with red dye in place of a classic weapon<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Graham M.|last2=Smith|first2=Sarah|last3=Blincoe|first3=Christine|date=2008|title=A \u201cweapon focus\u201d effect in children|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160701340593|journal=Psychology, Crime & Law|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=19\u201328|doi=10.1080/10683160701340593|issn=1068-316X|via=}}</ref>. The presence of the syringe caused a reduction in performance on a memory task, suggesting that the children diverted a significant proportion of their attention to the weapon, so that their recall ability was negatively impacted. This implies that the weapon focus effect does not exclusively occur in adults. At a similar time, Pickel et al. (2008) conducted comparable research, which used videos containing either a weapon or neutral object.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri L.|last2=Narter|first2=Dana B.|last3=Jameson|first3=Molly M.|last4=Lenhardt|first4=Thomas T.|date=2008|title=The weapon focus effect in child eyewitnesses|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160701391307|journal=Psychology, Crime & Law|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=61\u201372|doi=10.1080/10683160701391307|issn=1068-316X|via=}}</ref> Again, children recalled significantly less accurate information when a knife was involved as opposed to a water bottle. The researchers attributed this to the unexpected nature of the knife and schema violation. Adults were found to be more accurate in general with their recollection of the perpetrator than children; language abilities, appreciation for the situation and differing locations were all implicated in these asymmetries. \n\n==Reducing weapon focus and its impact on criminal cases==\n\nPickel, Ross, and Truelove (2006) decided to take a more in depth look at these ideas and apply them specifically to reducing weapon focus.  If weapon focus is an automatic process, then the capture of attention may be out of an [[Witness|eyewitness]]' control.  However, if there is no automatic capture of the [[witness]]' attention, then weapon focus effect may be able to be overcome.  Specific training can be developed to teach a person who may be at risk of an [[armed robbery]], such as a [[bank teller]] or [[cashier]], to perform an identification that is comparable to if there was no weapon present.  The data indicate that weapons do not capture attention automatically and involuntarily.  If a witness was given a lecture about weapon focus and the problems that can arise in [[memory]] formation in an incident when a weapon is present at the scene, they can more accurately identify a [[perpetrator]] of a crime.  This shows that with proper training weapon focus effect can be overcome and an eyewitness' testimony becomes more accurate.\nThese findings, however, are [[theoretical]] and need to be replicated in real world situations to really assess the usefulness of them.  They show great promise that weapon focus effect and be counteracted by education on the topic, but they will remain theoretical until further research and implementation of the idea can be conducted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pickel|first1=Kerri L.|last2=Ross|first2=S. J.|last3=Truelove|first3=Ronald S.|year=2006|title=Do weapons automatically capture attention?|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=20|issue=7|pages=871\u2013893|doi=10.1002/acp.1235}}</ref>\n\nOne method that has become more and more prevalent to reduce negative [[Punishment|consequences]] that can stem from errors in [[eyewitness testimony]], including errors that can arise from weapon focus effect, is expert witness testimonies by research psychologists about eyewitness testimony.<ref name=\"Leippe\">{{cite journal|last=Leippe|first=M.

This form of expert testimony has been called social framework testimony, defined by Cronin<ref name=\"Cronin\">{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Christopher|title=Forensic Psychology: An applied approach|year=2009|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7575-6174-0}}</ref> as \"expert testimony that presents conclusions based on social science research to assist the court in making a decision.\"  The expert testimony would provide the jury with a context for evaluating eyewitness testimonies and the jury is meant to factor that into its [[decision making]] process.<ref name=\"Leippe\" /> These educational sessions in the [[courtroom]] will help make the presentation of eyewitness testimony as rigorous as possible and put as much scrutiny on the social evidence as what is put on physical, scientific evidence.  Eyewitness testimony is very often wrong, and the scrutiny put on it greatly reduces the number of false convictions.<ref name=\"Cronin\" />\n\nThe major problem with this strategy is that many judges do not allow this [[expert testimony]] in their courts.  For example, in the court case Blasdell v. State (2010, 2015)<ref>Blasdell v. State, No. 09-09-00286-CR(2010). WL 3910586 (Tex. App. \u2013 Beaumont Oct. 6, 2010).</ref><ref>Blasdell v. State, No. PD-0162-14 (2015). S.W. 3d 824 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp., 2015).</ref> a woman who had been robbed at gunpoint by an unknown man was able to describe the gun in great detail but could only provide very imprecise details of the perpetrator. The defense was unable to present expert testimony on the concept of weapon focus and the suspect was convicted based on the eyewitness testimony. Despite cases like these, reasoning behind judges not permitting expert testimony is Their reasoning is usually that they think what the social framework testimony will present is [[common knowledge]].  However, the data overwhelmingly shows that the typical jury member does not know most of the information presented by the expert.  The fallibility of eyewitness testimony is not common knowledge and eyewitness psychology can offer valid and constructive information to juries.  Even with this knowledge, jury decisions cannot perfectly serve justice without exceptions, but perfection in the [[legal system]] is an unattainable goal.  However, any information that can be presented about the shortcomings of eyewitness testimony can better serve justice in the long run.<ref name=\"Leippe\" />  According to a 2001 survey of experts on eyewitness testimony, 87% found the weapon focus effect to be sufficiently reliable to form the basis of expert testimony in criminal trials.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul M.|last2=Tubb|first2=V.

There are arguments that suggest that these social framework testimonies discredit the eyewitnesses and put the victims and [[Witness|bystanders]] on trial.  This is not the purpose of the experts though.  These testimonies are merely attempting to educate jury members of problems that can arise from eyewitnesses.  There can also be issues raised about the [[credibility]] of the expert testimonies.  The screening process of the experts is not very stringent and the criteria of an expert witness are not laid out in black in white.  This can lead to a battle of the experts between [[prosecution]] and [[defense (legal)|defense]].  Any testimony the prosecution or defense deems relevant to contradict the opposing side may be introduced if the judge allows it, so an expert can be called and a battle of the experts can ensue.  This takes away from the central point of a trial and can overwhelm the jury. \n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Emotion and memory]]\n* [[Eyewitness memory]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Memory}}\n{{Psychology}}\n\n[[Category:Forensic phenomena]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Weapons effect}}\n\n{{Psychology sidebar}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:example of weapon focus.jpg|thumb|400px|Demonstration of weapon focus effect]] -->\n'''Weapon focus''' is the concentration on a [[weapon]] by a witness of a crime and the subsequent inability to accurately remember other details of the crime.<ref name=\":1\" />  Weapon focus is a factor that heavily affects the reliability of [[Eyewitness Identification|eyewitness testimony]].

In actuality, they were to take part in a simulated interaction intended to determine whether the presence of a [[weapon]] would influence eyewitness memory for an event. Participants in the control condition sat in a waiting room where they overheard a conversation between two people following which a man exited with greasy hands and a grease pen. In the weapon condition, participants sat in the same waiting room, but instead they heard a violent argument \u2013 including furniture being thrown around \u2013 following which a man came out holding a blood-stained knife. During a photo line-up, the control participants were more likely to accurately identify the man they saw in the waiting room relative to participants in the weapon condition (49% versus 33% correct identifications).<ref name=\"Johnson Scott\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=C.|last2=Scott|first2=B.|title=Eyewitness testimony and suspect identification as a function of arousal, sex or witness and scheduling of interrogation|journal=Paper Presented at the American Psychological Association Annual Meeting|year=1976}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, initially Loftus postulated that it is an expected occurrence in the event where an individual is highly aroused, such as in the case of a frightening situation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology Applied: A Symposium at the 22nd International Congress of Applied Psychology|last=Izawa|first=Chizuko|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0805808308|location=New York|pages=207}}</ref> This suggestion was criticized for its lack of supporting evidence, so its author conducted several studies in 1987 and finally demonstrated the viability of weapon focus.<ref name=\":0\" /> The study conducted by Johnson and Scott (1976) represents one of the few early simulation studies available, likely due to the [[Human subject research|ethical issues]] surrounding the exposure of research participants to a putatively threatening scenario. For this reason much of the research conducted on the weapon focus effect has made use of videos or slide shows.<ref name=\"Johnson Scott\" /> In one of the first such experiments, Loftus, Loftus and Messo (1987) had participants watch a video in which a young man approached the counter of a fast food restaurant, presented an object to the cashier, accepted money and left. In the control condition the man presented a cheque to the cashier whereas in the weapon condition the man presented a gun. Specialized equipment tracked the participant's gaze as they viewed the video to determine with what frequency (and for how long) they fixated upon the item of interest (the cheque or the gun). Relative to the control condition, participants in the weapon condition looked at the item the man was holding more frequently and for greater duration. Further, when tested for the details of the event, performance was better for the control condition relative to the weapon condition - with the exception that participants in the weapon condition were more likely to recall what object the man was holding (a gun).<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|first1=Elizabeth|last1=Loftus|last2=Loftus|first2=Geoffrey Russell| last3=Messos|first3=Jane|title=Some facts about weapon focus|journal=Law and Human Behavior|year=1987| volume=11 | issue = 1|pages=55\u201362|url= https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF01044839| doi=10.1007/bf01044839}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant challenge to the studies on the weapon focus effect has been their [[ecological validity]]. Specifically, many theorists have argued that the effect is limited to the laboratory design. These claims have been supported by the relative absence of applied evidence supporting the effect. Several reports have been published looking for evidence of a weapon focus effect using records of actual crimes. According to the laboratory findings summarized above, the prediction had been that eyewitness memory would be worse for weapon crimes compared to non-weapon crimes. Many primary studies have failed to support this prediction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Karen|last2=Livosky|first2=Marilyn| last3=Mather|first3=Mara|title=The weapon focus effect revisited: The role of novelty|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=1998|volume=3|issue=2|pages=287\u2013303|url=http://pantheon.yale.edu/%7Ekm294/1998_Mitchell_Livosky_Mather_LegCrimPsy.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8333.1998.tb00367.x}}</ref> Even so, a recent [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Fawcett et al. (2013) has demonstrated that when the data for all of the applied studies are combined, there ''is'' a small but reliable effect suggesting that weapon presence impairs actual eyewitness memory.

It found that the exposure to firearms was associated with significantly better eyewitness descriptions especially regarding basic features such as gender, height, build, age, and ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Psychology and Law: A Critical Introduction|last=Kapardis|first=Andreas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780521707732|location=Cambridge|pages=52}}</ref>\n\n==Causes of weapon focus==\n\nA leading explanation for a cause of weapons focus is the unusualness of the situation, being a witness to a crime. Since the initial research conducted by Johnson and Scott (1976) and Loftus et al. (1987), others have demonstrated a similar effect using unusual objects rather than weapons. These findings are described as the \"Unusual Item Hypothesis.\" This effect is seen when an object does not fit with the [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of the situation.  Attention is then drawn to the out-of-place object and less attention is paid to other objects in the scene making recalling these other objects more difficult. This effect was observed in Toronto in 1997 when a robber entered a coffee shop and demanded money while threatening to strangle a goose he was holding if the he did not receive the money.  Meanwhile, the customers were too focussed on the strangeness of a goose in the coffee shop to observe any details about the perpetrator himself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fawcett|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Russell|first2=Emily J.|last3=Peace|first3=Kristine A.|last4=Christie|first4=John|date=2013-01-01|title=Of guns and geese: a meta-analytic review of the \u2018weapon focus\u2019 literature|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1068316X.2011.599325|journal=Psychology, Crime & Law|volume=19|issue=1|pages=35\u201366|doi=10.1080/1068316X.2011.599325|issn=1068-316X}}</ref>  This effect has also been observed in the lab. For example, Pickel (1998) demonstrated an effect comparable to weapon focus using a video in which a man approached a cashier and presented a whole raw chicken or miniature [[Pillsbury Dough Boy]] instead of an expected item such as a wallet. From her finding, Pickel (1998) argued that the weapon focus arose from the unusual nature of the object in the relation to the context in which it was presented. \n\nIn their 2013 meta-analysis, Fawcett et al. (2013) presented the issues surrounding the arousal/threat hypothesis. This is one of the oldest explanations connected to the weapon focus phenomenon, and relies on the [[Yerkes\u2013Dodson law|Yerkes-Dodson law]] that links arousal and performance;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yerkes|first=Robert M.|last2=Dodson|first2=John D.|date=1908|title=The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.920180503|journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=459\u2013482|doi=10.1002/cne.920180503|issn=1550-7149}}</ref> emotionally arousing states, such as stress, can enhance performance up to a point, but after this there are detrimental impacts on cognitive functions, like memory and learning. In situations where a weapon is present, witnesses tend to focus on the object of arousal and miss peripheral details, like the identity of the perpetrator. This explanation relies on Easterbrook's (1959) theory that stress causes a reduction in mental resources, thus the range of cues a subject can attend to in this situation will be significantly reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Easterbrook|first=J. A.|date=1959|title=The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/h0047707|journal=Psychological Review|volume=66|issue=3|pages=183\u2013201|doi=10.1037/h0047707|issn=1939-1471}}</ref> In a dangerous situation where a weapon is present, survival becomes the most important facets and peripheral information is overlooked. This means that the witness has a heightened memory for the weapon, but may struggle to recall other information. Over time, research into the role of anxiety on weapon focus has produced inconsistent findings, causing researchers to look at alternative causes of the phenomenon. The relative contributions of both arousal and unusualness remain one of the primary theoretical issues in this literature, with some authors arguing for a contribution of both.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|year=1998|title=Unusualness and threat as possible causes of \"weapon focus\"|journal=Memory|volume=6|issue=3|pages=277\u2013295|doi=10.1080/741942361|pmid=9709443}}</ref>\n\nAnother potential cause of weapon focus is the \"automatic capture\" explanation.  This suggests that the [[attention]] paid to a weapon is automatic and unintentional.  Studies have been performed that show that even if a subject is asked to ignore specific [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] they are unable to, thus indicating an automatic response.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Remington|first1=Roger W.|last2=Johnston|first2=James C.|last3=Yantis|first3=Steven|title=Involuntary attentional capture by abrupt onsets|journal=Perception & Psychophysics|year=1992| volume=51 | issue = 3|pages=279\u2013290|url= http://pbs.jhu.edu/research/Yantis/publications/PDF/Johnston-etal-P-P-1992.pdf|doi=10.3758/bf03212254|pmid=1561053}}</ref>  Remington et al. (1992) conclude that a participant might intend to ignore an event, but their attention is often automatically captured by it - as such, an eyewitness may not intend to solely focus on a weapon, but if their diversion of attention to it cannot be controlled, they possess little ability to ignore it. Yantis and Jonides (1996) suggest that it makes adaptive sense for humans to divert attention towards new objects, as a new representation has to be created for that object, presenting another explanation for the weapon focus phenomenon. However, they also conclude that attention focus is not automatic and can be directed on command, especially if attention is already focused somewhere specific.  If attention is already focused away from a certain stimulus, then automatic capture is avoidable.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yantis|first1=Steven|last2=Jonides|first2=John|title=Attentional Capture by Abrupt Onsets: New Perceptual Objects or Visual Masking?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1996| volume=22 | issue = 6|pages=1505\u20131513|url= http://pbs.jhu.edu/research/Yantis/publications/PDF/yantis_jonides_JEPHPP_1996.pdf|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.22.6.1505}}</ref>\n\n== Individual differences in weapon focus ==\nPickel looked into some differences in the memory of the eyewitnesses, when the physical traits of the perpetrator change. Firstly, the difference in memory was examined between eyewitnesses that saw a white perpetrator versus a black perpetrator. Her research, conducted in 2009, showed that the weapon focus effect weakens with 'black' perpetrators in comparison to 'white' perpetrators, and that the weapon focus effect is not significant when a \"Black perpetrator wore a style of clothing that is strongly associated with Black men\". It is suggested that individuals who observe a black perpetrator who is armed automatically activates a [[stereotype]] that links black men with weapons and crime. As a consequence, this reduces the unusualness of the weapon and increases the likelihood of attracting [[attention]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|last2=Sneyd|first2=Danielle|year=2018|title=The weapon focus effect is weaker with black versus white male perpetrators|journal=Memory|edition=1|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29\u201341|doi=10.1080/09658211.2017.1317814|pmid=28436249}}</ref>.\n\nIn the same year, Pickel also looked at the weapon focus effect on memory for female versus male perpetrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri L.|date=2009|title=The weapon focus effect on memory for female versus male perpetrators|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210903029412|journal=Memory|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=664\u2013678|doi=10.1080/09658210903029412|issn=0965-8211|via=}}</ref> The experiments involved participants watching videos that either had a male or female perpetrator, holding either a gun or a neutral object. Overall, the weapon focus effect was strongest when the gun was held by a woman as opposed to a male perpetrator. Participants rated the presence of the gun as more unusual when it was held by a woman versus when it was held by a man, less accurately described the physical traits of the perpetrator when they were holding a gun and the overall memory falsities were greater in the conditions where the gun was held by a female. The presence of the gun in the possession of the female perpetrators was more unexpected, thus participants allocated more of their attention to the weapon over their physical traits. Pickel did, however, find that the weapon focus effect was mitigated when participants were primed and the perpetrators were categorized as dangerous and aggressive.\n\nThese differences in eyewitness memory can be attributed to whether the perpetrator holding a weapon is consistent with the eyewitness's [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]. Pickel posits that if the object held by the target falls in line with the witness's schema, they will not divert as much attention to it and the characteristics of the perpetrator will be encoded normally - it is only when the combination of the perpetrator and the object is not consistent with the schema that the weapon focus effect will be significant in distorting memory. In reference to the study mentioned above, a female perpetrator holding a gun violated the participants' schema more than the male perpetrator; the presence of a gun with a man was deemed as less unexpected.\n\nIn light of research recommendations, some more recent research has looked into the individual differences surrounding the weapon focus phenomenon, where not all samples of participants have reacted in the same way to the presence of a weapon, namely children. In some situations, like domestic violence, children can be crucial eyewitnesses, so recent research has looked at the age at which the weapon focus effect becomes influential. One study looked at the impacts of a surprising object on the memory of children, using a syringe filled with red dye in place of a classic weapon<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Graham M.|last2=Smith|first2=Sarah|last3=Blincoe|first3=Christine|date=2008|title=A \u201cweapon focus\u201d effect in children|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160701340593|journal=Psychology, Crime & Law|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=19\u201328|doi=10.1080/10683160701340593|issn=1068-316X|via=}}</ref>. The presence of the syringe caused a reduction in performance on a memory task, suggesting that the children diverted a significant proportion of their attention to the weapon, so that their recall ability was negatively impacted. This implies that the weapon focus effect does not exclusively occur in adults. At a similar time, Pickel et al. (2008) conducted comparable research, which used videos containing either a weapon or neutral object.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri L.|last2=Narter|first2=Dana B.|last3=Jameson|first3=Molly M.|last4=Lenhardt|first4=Thomas T.|date=2008|title=The weapon focus effect in child eyewitnesses|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160701391307|journal=Psychology, Crime & Law|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=61\u201372|doi=10.1080/10683160701391307|issn=1068-316X|via=}}</ref> Again, children recalled significantly less accurate information when a knife was involved as opposed to a water bottle. The researchers attributed this to the unexpected nature of the knife and schema violation. Adults were found to be more accurate in general with their recollection of the perpetrator than children; language abilities, appreciation for the situation and differing locations were all implicated in these asymmetries. \n\n==Reducing weapon focus and its impact on criminal cases==\n\nPickel, Ross, and Truelove (2006) decided to take a more in depth look at these ideas and apply them specifically to reducing weapon focus.  If weapon focus is an automatic process, then the capture of attention may be out of an [[Witness|eyewitness]]' control.  However, if there is no automatic capture of the [[witness]]' attention, then weapon focus effect may be able to be overcome.  Specific training can be developed to teach a person who may be at risk of an [[armed robbery]], such as a [[bank teller]] or [[cashier]], to perform an identification that is comparable to if there was no weapon present.  The data indicate that weapons do not capture attention automatically and involuntarily.  If a witness was given a lecture about weapon focus and the problems that can arise in [[memory]] formation in an incident when a weapon is present at the scene, they can more accurately identify a [[perpetrator]] of a crime.  This shows that with proper training weapon focus effect can be overcome and an eyewitness' testimony becomes more accurate.\nThese findings, however, are [[theoretical]] and need to be replicated in real world situations to really assess the usefulness of them.  They show great promise that weapon focus effect and be counteracted by education on the topic, but they will remain theoretical until further research and implementation of the idea can be conducted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pickel|first1=Kerri L.|last2=Ross|first2=S. J.|last3=Truelove|first3=Ronald S.|year=2006|title=Do weapons automatically capture attention?|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=20|issue=7|pages=871\u2013893|doi=10.1002/acp.1235}}</ref>\n\nOne method that has become more and more prevalent to reduce negative [[Punishment|consequences]] that can stem from errors in [[eyewitness testimony]], including errors that can arise from weapon focus effect, is expert witness testimonies by research psychologists about eyewitness testimony.<ref name=\"Leippe\">{{cite journal|last=Leippe|first=M. R.|title= The case for expert testimony about eyewitness memory.|journal=Psychology, Public Policy, and Law|year=1995| volume=1 | issue = 4|pages=909\u2013959|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayrecord&uid=1996-13282-001|doi=10.1037/1076-8971.1.4.909}}</ref>  This is an educational session, which a [[judge]] has to allow, given by a [[forensic psychologist]] to a [[jury]] as part of the [[trial]].  This form of expert testimony has been called social framework testimony, defined by Cronin<ref name=\"Cronin\">{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Christopher|title=Forensic Psychology: An applied approach|year=2009|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7575-6174-0}}</ref> as \"expert testimony that presents conclusions based on social science research to assist the court in making a decision.\"  The expert testimony would provide the jury with a context for evaluating eyewitness testimonies and the jury is meant to factor that into its [[decision making]] process.<ref name=\"Leippe\" /> These educational sessions in the [[courtroom]] will help make the presentation of eyewitness testimony as rigorous as possible and put as much scrutiny on the social evidence as what is put on physical, scientific evidence.  Eyewitness testimony is very often wrong, and the scrutiny put on it greatly reduces the number of false convictions.<ref name=\"Cronin\" />\n\nThe major problem with this strategy is that many judges do not allow this [[expert testimony]] in their courts.  For example, in the court case Blasdell v. State (2010, 2015)<ref>Blasdell v. State, No. 09-09-00286-CR(2010). WL 3910586 (Tex. App. \u2013 Beaumont Oct. 6, 2010).</ref><ref>Blasdell v. State, No. PD-0162-14 (2015). S.W. 3d 824 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp., 2015).</ref> a woman who had been robbed at gunpoint by an unknown man was able to describe the gun in great detail but could only provide very imprecise details of the perpetrator. The defense was unable to present expert testimony on the concept of weapon focus and the suspect was convicted based on the eyewitness testimony. Despite cases like these, reasoning behind judges not permitting expert testimony is Their reasoning is usually that they think what the social framework testimony will present is [[common knowledge]].  However, the data overwhelmingly shows that the typical jury member does not know most of the information presented by the expert.  The fallibility of eyewitness testimony is not common knowledge and eyewitness psychology can offer valid and constructive information to juries.  Even with this knowledge, jury decisions cannot perfectly serve justice without exceptions, but perfection in the [[legal system]] is an unattainable goal.  However, any information that can be presented about the shortcomings of eyewitness testimony can better serve justice in the long run.<ref name=\"Leippe\" />  According to a 2001 survey of experts on eyewitness testimony, 87% found the weapon focus effect to be sufficiently reliable to form the basis of expert testimony in criminal trials.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul M.|last2=Tubb|first2=V. Anne|last3=Hosch|first3=Harmon M.|last4=Memon|first4=Amina|date=May 2001|title=On the \"general acceptance' of eyewitness testimony research: A new survey of the experts|url=http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/kassin_tubb_hosch_memon_2001.pdf|journal=American Psychologist|volume=56|issue=5|pages=405\u2013416|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.56.5.405}}</ref> \n\nThere can be some ethical concerns to these expert witnesses.  There are arguments that suggest that these social framework testimonies discredit the eyewitnesses and put the victims and [[Witness|bystanders]] on trial.  This is not the purpose of the experts though.  These testimonies are merely attempting to educate jury members of problems that can arise from eyewitnesses.  There can also be issues raised about the [[credibility]] of the expert testimonies.  The screening process of the experts is not very stringent and the criteria of an expert witness are not laid out in black in white.  This can lead to a battle of the experts between [[prosecution]] and [[defense (legal)|defense]].  Any testimony the prosecution or defense deems relevant to contradict the opposing side may be introduced if the judge allows it, so an expert can be called and a battle of the experts can ensue.  This takes away from the central point of a trial and can overwhelm the jury. \n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Emotion and memory]]\n* [[Eyewitness memory]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Memory}}\n{{Psychology}}\n\n[[Category:Forensic phenomena]]\n", "name_user": "Jnasco", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIndividual differences in weapon focus:added citation for sentence that was from previously used reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_focus"}

The municipal unit includes the three nearby islets Diakopo, Diaplo and Tracheia.\n\n==Sazan==\n{{Infobox islands\n| name                             = Sazan (\u03a3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd)  \n| image                            = Porti_i_Vlores.jpg\n| image_caption                    = Sazan seen from the [[Port of Vlor\u00eb]]\n| native_name                      = <!-- or |local_name= -->\n| native_name_link                 = \n| native_name_lang                 = \n| sobriquet                        = <!-- or |nickname= -->\n| image_map                        = \n| map_alt                          = \n| map_size                         = \n| map_caption                      = \n| pushpin_map                      = \n| pushpin_label                    = \n| pushpin_label_position           = \n| pushpin_map_alt                  = \n| pushpin_relief                   = \n| pushpin_map_caption              = \n| coordinates                      = {{coord|40|29|37|N|19|16|50|E|region:AL-LU_type:isle|display=inline}}  \n| etymology                        = \n| location                         = <!-- mandatory, body of water where located -->\n| grid_reference                   = <!-- UK only -->\n| archipelago                      = \n| waterbody                        = \n| total_islands                    = \n| major_islands                    = \n| area_km2                         = 5.7\n| area_footnotes                   = \n| rank                             = \n| length_km                        = 4.8 \n| length_footnotes                 = \n| width_km                         = 2\n| width_footnotes                  = \n| coastline_km                     = \n| coastline_footnotes              = \n| elevation_m                      = \n| elevation_footnotes              = \n| highest_mount                    = \n| country                          = [[Albania]]\n| country_admin_divisions_title    = \n| country_admin_divisions          = \n| country_admin_divisions_title_1  = \n| country_admin_divisions_1        = \n| country_admin_divisions_title_2  = \n| country_admin_divisions_2        = \n| country_capital_type             = \n| country_capital                  = \n| country_largest_city_type        = \n| country_largest_city             = \n| country_capital_and_largest_city = \n| country_largest_city_population  = \n| country_leader_title             = \n| country_leader_name              = \n| country_area_km2                 = \n| demonym                          = \n| population                       = \n| population_as_of                 = \n| population_footnotes             = \n| population_rank                  = \n| population_rank_max              = \n| density_km2                      = \n| density_rank                     = \n| density_footnotes                = \n| languages                        = \n| ethnic_groups                    = \n| timezone1                        = \n| utc_offset1                      = \n| timezone1_DST                    = \n| utc_offset1_DST                  = \n| website                          = \n| additional_info                  = \n| footnotes                        = \n}}\n[[Sazan]] ({{lang-sq-definite|Sazani}}; {{lang-it|Saseno}}; {{lang-la|Saso}}; {{lang-grc|\u03a3\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd}}) is an [[island]] inside the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in southern [[Albania]]. \nIn 1864 the island was ceded to Greece with the rest of the Ionian Islands as part of Diapontia islands, but not occupied, coming under de facto Ottoman control. It was not until the First Balkan War in 1912 that Greece landed soldiers on the island and formally claimed it. After the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913, Italy and Austria-Hungary pressed Greece to evacuate the southern part of modern Albania. Finding the island too unimportant to risk war with Italy, Greece evacuated it.<ref name=\"pyrroulas.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n== Origin of Diapontians ==\nThe traditional aspect of the local population is that their roots are from [[Epirus]] region and [[Paxos (island)|Paxos]] as many diapontian surnames are common with [[Epirote]], [[Northern Epirus]] and Paxos surnames (e.x Argyros, Mastoras etc.) and it's a common opinion that their roots seem to be Epirotic, [[Arvanites|Arvanitic]], [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] and from Paxos without forgetting the Italian and Venetian influence. As the Diapontians The main point of view of the most Diapontians the last century is that families from Paxos and Epirus immigrated Othoni. Also, the surnames around Diapontia are in some cases completely the same on each island as many Othonians immigrated the other two islands after immigrated Othoni leaving Paxos or Epurus. There are also many villages of Diapontia Islands which have the same names with some of Paxos and Epirus (Deletatika, Argyratika etc.)\n\nThe Diapontians organized and created villages based on their relatives, that is, each village includes relatives. Each village has people related to the other villages and almost all the islanders are related to each other. With few exceptions, each village bears the name of the family surname that resides there like in Paxos. (e.g. from the adjective Argyros, Argyratika etc.)\nFor this reason, the Diapontians shared the same surnames. They had to bring their surnames and family nicknames so that they could stand out from each other. The nicknames in this case give the origin and the properties of each family. Most of them are hellenized-Italian, Latinized-Greek, Epirotic and Vlach.\n\nThe reasons of the migration to Diapontia are not entirely clear and may be manifold. The main reason seems to be the need of the islands in labor in agriculture. Waves of migration in Diapontia started around 1600, reached a peak some time during the 19th century, and ended around 1800 reaching Othoni starting from [[Ano Panta]], then Ereikousa and Mathraki. [[Chorio, Othonoi|Chorio]] seems to be the first settlement of Othoni and refers until today as \"the capital of the island\". The folklorist-anthropologist and specialist in Greek folklore [[Dimitrios Loukatos]] documented that the Diapontians origin had for sure connections with Epirus and Paxos as during his research on Diapontia Islands in 1960's found similarities between the traditional life and costumes of Diapontians with Epirots and that they are not exactly the same with the Corfiots.\n\nThe last decades the connections with Epirus and Paxos are not so many as before. The islands are completely connected with [[Corfu]] as the most many Diapontians are living in Corfu and as result some of them consider themselves to be of Corfu origin. Many Diapontians immigrated USA during 20th century and they have American citizenship.<ref name=akron/>{{rp|20,21,22}}\nThere are also many diapontian surnames and toponyms that have [[United States of the Ionian Islands|British]], Italian and [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Venetian]] routes.\n\n== Dialect ==\nA dialect is spoken resembling that of Corfu and having a similar prosody but is  it completely the same as many diapontian words are completely different to that of Corfu. It is heavily influenced by Italian and Epirotic.\n\n== Diaspora ==\nFrom the beginning of 60's many Diapontians decided to emigrate to USA, Canada and Germany due to unemployment in the Diapontia islands. There are over 300 Erikoussian families in New York. The Diapontians of North America had established their own societies and every island has its own one. In Montgomery, Alabama the house of one Othonian seaman called Alexandros Markou Kasimis was designated by the US authorities as a preservable monument as it seems that he was one of the first Greek immigrants in USA. There are plenty of Diapontians in Montgomery today. \nFrom the beginning of 20th century many Diapontians had emigrated to the Bronx. There are about 50 Othonian families living in Pennsylvania.\nOthonians of USA established in 1966 their own society called \"Society of Calypso Island of Othoni Kerkyras\". In 1977, renamed as \"Othonian society of USA\".<ref name=akron/>{{rp|88}}\n\n== Transport ==\nDiapontia are accessible by boat with services from Corfu port and [[Agios Stefanos Avliotes]]. They have heliports for emergencies. [[Asphalt]] roads are available on many parts of the islands which are extended to settlements. There is complete [[electrification]] and a telephone network with Internet access.\n\n==Sports==\nA.O Othoni, A.O Mathraki and A.O Ereikoussa were amateur football teams based on each island. During the 1970s and the 1980s the teams used to play against each other on fields in Chorio and Dafni settlemt of Othoni.\nThere was a football team called \"F.C Ereikousa\" created by Greek-Americans in USA.\nIn 2001, some Ereikoussians established in Corfu a football team called \"\u0391.\u039f \u0395\u03a1\u0395\u0399\u039a\u039f\u03a5\u03a3\u0391\" (A.S EREIKOUSA, former A.E ROPA) and they participate in Corfiot amateur football league. The team abolished some years later.\nIn Othoni, there is one 5x5 football field and one basketball cort next to Agia Triada church.\n\n==Notable Diapontians==\n* Maria Aronis (born 1957), Greek-American Cardiothoracic surgeon \n* [[Linda Katehi]] (born 1954), Greek-American engineer, sixth chancellor of the University of California, Davis\n* Dale Katechis, American, owner of the [[Oskar Blues Brewery]] in Colorado.\n* Anastasios Katechis, assistant professor in [[University of Athens]].\n* John Katechis (born 1992), murderer of [[George Webber]]\n* Spyros Katechis (1919-unknown), Greek-Egyptian military commander and spy during World war II.\n\n==Diapontia in literature==\n*Ionion akron.

It was not until the First Balkan War in 1912 that Greece landed soldiers on the island and formally claimed it. After the end of the Second Balkan War in 1913, Italy and Austria-Hungary pressed Greece to evacuate the southern part of modern Albania. Finding the island too unimportant to risk war with Italy, Greece evacuated it.<ref name=\"pyrroulas.blogspot.com\"/><ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n== Origin of Diapontians ==\nThe traditional aspect of the local population is that their roots are from [[Epirus]] region and [[Paxos (island)|Paxos]] as many diapontian surnames are common with [[Epirote]], [[Northern Epirus]] and Paxos surnames (e.x Argyros, Mastoras etc.) and it's a common opinion that their roots seem to be Epirotic, [[Arvanites|Arvanitic]], [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] and from Paxos without forgetting the Italian and Venetian influence. As the Diapontians The main point of view of the most Diapontians the last century is that families from Paxos and Epirus immigrated Othoni. Also, the surnames around Diapontia are in some cases completely the same on each island as many Othonians immigrated the other two islands after immigrated Othoni leaving Paxos or Epurus. There are also many villages of Diapontia Islands which have the same names with some of Paxos and Epirus (Deletatika, Argyratika etc.)\n\nThe Diapontians organized and created villages based on their relatives, that is, each village includes relatives. Each village has people related to the other villages and almost all the islanders are related to each other. With few exceptions, each village bears the name of the family surname that resides there like in Paxos. (e.g. from the adjective Argyros, Argyratika etc.)\nFor this reason, the Diapontians shared the same surnames. They had to bring their surnames and family nicknames so that they could stand out from each other. The nicknames in this case give the origin and the properties of each family. Most of them are hellenized-Italian, Latinized-Greek, Epirotic and Vlach.\n\nThe reasons of the migration to Diapontia are not entirely clear and may be manifold. The main reason seems to be the need of the islands in labor in agriculture. Waves of migration in Diapontia started around 1600, reached a peak some time during the 19th century, and ended around 1800 reaching Othoni starting from [[Ano Panta]], then Ereikousa and Mathraki. [[Chorio, Othonoi|Chorio]] seems to be the first settlement of Othoni and refers until today as \"the capital of the island\". The folklorist-anthropologist and specialist in Greek folklore [[Dimitrios Loukatos]] documented that the Diapontians origin had for sure connections with Epirus and Paxos as during his research on Diapontia Islands in 1960's found similarities between the traditional life and costumes of Diapontians with Epirots and that they are not exactly the same with the Corfiots.\n\nThe last decades the connections with Epirus and Paxos are not so many as before. The islands are completely connected with [[Corfu]] as the most many Diapontians are living in Corfu and as result some of them consider themselves to be of Corfu origin. Many Diapontians immigrated USA during 20th century and they have American citizenship.<ref name=akron/>{{rp|20,21,22}}\nThere are also many diapontian surnames and toponyms that have [[United States of the Ionian Islands|British]], Italian and [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Venetian]] routes.\n\n== Dialect ==\nA dialect is spoken resembling that of Corfu and having a similar prosody but is  it completely the same as many diapontian words are completely different to that of Corfu. It is heavily influenced by Italian and Epirotic.\n\n== Diaspora ==\nFrom the beginning of 60's many Diapontians decided to emigrate to USA, Canada and Germany due to unemployment in the Diapontia islands. There are over 300 Erikoussian families in New York. The Diapontians of North America had established their own societies and every island has its own one. In Montgomery, Alabama the house of one Othonian seaman called Alexandros Markou Kasimis was designated by the US authorities as a preservable monument as it seems that he was one of the first Greek immigrants in USA. There are plenty of Diapontians in Montgomery today. \nFrom the beginning of 20th century many Diapontians had emigrated to the Bronx. There are about 50 Othonian families living in Pennsylvania.\nOthonians of USA established in 1966 their own society called \"Society of Calypso Island of Othoni Kerkyras\". In 1977, renamed as \"Othonian society of USA\".<ref name=akron/>{{rp|88}}\n\n== Transport ==\nDiapontia are accessible by boat with services from Corfu port and [[Agios Stefanos Avliotes]]. They have heliports for emergencies. [[Asphalt]] roads are available on many parts of the islands which are extended to settlements. There is complete [[electrification]] and a telephone network with Internet access.\n\n==Sports==\nA.O Othoni, A.O Mathraki and A.O Ereikoussa were amateur football teams based on each island. During the 1970s and the 1980s the teams used to play against each other on fields in Chorio and Dafni settlemt of Othoni.\nThere was a football team called \"F.C Ereikousa\" created by Greek-Americans in USA.\nIn 2001, some Ereikoussians established in Corfu a football team called \"\u0391.\u039f \u0395\u03a1\u0395\u0399\u039a\u039f\u03a5\u03a3\u0391\" (A.S EREIKOUSA, former A.E ROPA) and they participate in Corfiot amateur football league.
