Formally, these vectors are elements of a [[complex number|complex]] [[Separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]]&nbsp;\u2013 variously called the [[State space (physics)|''state space'']] or the ''associated Hilbert space'' of the system&nbsp;\u2013 that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the [[projective space]] of a Hilbert space, usually called the [[complex projective space]]. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of [[square-integrable]] functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally [[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian]] (precisely: by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]) linear [[Operator (physics)|operator]] acting on the state space. Each [[eigenstate]] of an observable corresponds to an [[eigenvector]] of the operator, and the associated [[eigenvalue]] corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can attain only those discrete eigenvalues.\n\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a [[complex number|complex]] [[wave function]], also referred to as state vector in a complex [[vector space]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics Symmetries, Second edition|first1=Walter|last1=Greiner|first2=Berndt|last2=M\u00fcller|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=978-3-540-58080-5|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52 Chapter 1, p. 52]</ref> This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of [[probability|probabilities]] of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of [[conjugate variables]], such as position and momentum, to arbitrary precision. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant probability density, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08a.htm |title=Heisenberg \u2013 Quantum Mechanics, 1925\u20131927: The Uncertainty Relations |publisher=Aip.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement, the wave function containing the probability information for a system [[Collapse of the wavefunction|collapses]] from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable&nbsp;\u2013 which explains the choice of ''Hermitian'' operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the [[spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]] of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not [[Commutator|commute]].\n\nThe [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates]], in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of [[thought experiment]]s. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"[[Collapse of the wavefunction|wave function collapse]]\" (see, for example, the [[relative state interpretation]]). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become [[Quantum Entanglement|entangled]], so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity.

Instead, it makes a prediction using a [[probability distribution]]; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate (but better than [[Bohr model|the Bohr model]]) whereby electron location is given by a [[probability function]], the [[wave function]] [[eigenvalue]], such that the probability is the squared modulus of the [[probability amplitude|complex amplitude]], or [[quantum state]] nuclear attraction.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lodha |first1=Suresh K. |last2=Faaland |first2=Nikolai M. |last3=Charaniya |first3=Amin P. |last4=Varshney |first4=Pramod K. |last5=Mehrotra |first5=Kishan |last6=Mohan |first6=Chilukuri |display-authors=2 |title=Visualization of Uncertain Particle Movement (Proceeding Computer Graphics and Imaging) |url=ftp://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/.zfs/snapshot/2014-01-01/pub/lodha/papers/cgim2002.pdf |publisher=Actapress.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801014205/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7a4/ae7e57164c4afd726b567f863cce94ba9f86.pdf |archivedate=2018-08-01 |date=2002 |access-date=2018-08-01 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory|first1=Jack|last1=Hirshleifer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80412-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 265]|url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs|url-access=registration}}, [https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 Chapter, p. ]</ref> Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as [[eigenstate]]s of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning \"inherent\" or \"characteristic\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/eigen.html|title=dict.cc dictionary :: eigen :: German-English translation|date=|work=dict.cc|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are [[Conjugate variables|conjugate pairs]]) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs).  Rather, it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having ''[[Uncertainty principle|uncertain]]'' values and states having ''definite'' values (eigenstates).\n\nUsually, a system will not be in an [[eigenstate]] of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wave function will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or \"generalized\" eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as [[wave function collapse]], a controversial and much-debated process<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |title=Topics: Wave-Function Collapse |publisher=Phy.olemiss.edu |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228044927/http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.\n\nFor example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a [[wave packet]] centered around some mean position ''x''<sub>0</sub> (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.<ref name=\"google215\"/> It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near ''x''<sub>0</sub>, where the amplitude of the wave function is large.

The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] describes how wave functions change in time, playing a role similar to [[Newton's second law]] in [[classical mechanics]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Textbook of Quantum Mechanics|first1=Piravonu Mathews|last1=Mathews|first2=K.|last2=Venkatesan|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-096510-2|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36 Chapter 2, p. 36]</ref>\n\n[[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Fig. 1: [[Probability density function|Probability densities]] corresponding to the wave functions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left to right: ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ...).

One method, called [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak [[potential energy]].

This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the [[action principle]] in classical mechanics.\n\n==Relation to other scientific theories==\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a [[Hilbert space]] (crucially, that the space has an [[inner product]]) and that observables of the system are [[Hermitian operators]] acting on vectors in that space&nbsp;\u2013 although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the [[correspondence principle]], which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the ''classical'' or ''correspondence limit''. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|In the [[correspondence limit]] of '''quantum mechanics''': Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \"[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states\" and \"[[wave function collapse]]\", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was [[theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] [[classical mechanics]]. For instance, the well-known model of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the [[kinetic energy]] of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]].\n\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with [[special relativity]] involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] or the [[Dirac equation]]. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of [[quantum field theory]], which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, [[quantum electrodynamics]], provides a fully quantum description of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat [[electric charge|charged]] particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical [[electromagnetic field]]. For example, the elementary quantum model of the [[hydrogen atom]] describes the [[electric field]] of the hydrogen atom using a classical <math>\\textstyle -e^2/(4 \\pi\\epsilon_{_0}r)</math> [[Electric potential|Coulomb potential]]. This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of [[photon]]s by [[charged particle]]s.\n\n[[Field (physics)|Quantum field]] theories for the [[strong nuclear force]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called [[quantum chromodynamics]], and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s. The weak nuclear force and the [[electromagnetic force]] were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as [[electroweak theory]]), by the physicists [[Abdus Salam]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Steven Weinberg]].

In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bohr | first1 = N. | authorlink = Niels Bohr | year = 1928 | title = The Quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 121 | issue = 3050| pages = 580\u2013590 | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930).

It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a state as a physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition, with a definite trajectory of passage.

However, the lack of a correct theory of [[quantum gravity]] is an important issue in [[physical cosmology]] and the search by physicists for an elegant \"[[theory of everything|Theory of Everything]]\" (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics. Many prominent physicists, including [[Stephen Hawking]], worked for many years to create a theory underlying ''everything''. This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]] \u2013 the [[strong interaction|strong force]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and [[gravity]] \u2013 from a single force or phenomenon. However, after considering [[G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem]], Hawking concluded that a theory of everything is not possible, and stated so publicly in his lecture \"G\u00f6del and the End of Physics\" (2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking; G\u00f6del and the end of physics|date=|work=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521123113/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|archive-date=21 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Attempts at a unified field theory===\n{{Main|Grand unified theory}}\nThe quest to unify the [[fundamental force]]s through quantum mechanics is ongoing.

However&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  the expanded [[general relativity]], currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory. One of those searching for a coherent TOE is [[Edward Witten]], a theoretical physicist who formulated the [[M-theory]], which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based [[string theory]]. M-theory posits that our apparent [[4-dimensional spacetime]] is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are \u2013 at lower energies \u2013 completely \"compactified\" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.\n\nAnother popular theory is [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG) proposed by [[Carlo Rovelli]], that describes quantum properties of gravity. It is also a theory of [[quantum spacetime]] and [[Chronon|quantum time]], because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of [[gravity]]. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard [[general relativity]]. This theory describes space as granular analogous to the granularity of photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism and the discrete energy levels of atoms. More precisely, space is an extremely fine fabric or networks \"woven\" of finite loops called [[spin networks]]. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the [[Planck length]], which is approximately 1.616\u00d710<sup>\u221235</sup> m. According to this theory, there is no meaning to length shorter than this (cf. [[Planck scale]] energy).\n\n==Philosophical implications==\n{{Main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nSince its inception, the many [[counter-intuitive]] aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong [[philosophy|philosophical]] debates and many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]]. Even fundamental issues, such as [[Max Born]]'s basic [[Born rule|rules]] about [[probability amplitude]]s and [[probability distribution]]s, took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists.

According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a ''temporary'' feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a ''final'' renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". It also states that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the [[complementarity (physics)|conjugate]] nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\n\nAlbert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of [[determinism]] and of [[causality]]. He famously said about this, \"God does not play with dice\".<ref name=\"Harrison2000\">{{cite book|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Robert Harrison|last=Harrison|title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&pg=PA239|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|page=239}}</ref> He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or how it might be observed. That view is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state, which does not depend on the configuration space for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. Einstein also believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against [[action at a distance]]; in other words, he insisted on the [[principle of locality]]. He considered, but rejected on theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He believed that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances, and would not come quickly or easily. The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an [[epistemological]] point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a series of objections, of which the most famous has become known as the [[Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox]].\n\n[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this [[EPR paradox]] led to [[Bell's theorem|experimentally testable differences]] between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables.

Entanglement, as demonstrated in Bell-type experiments, does not violate [[causality]], since it does not involve transfer of information.  By the early 1980s, experiments had shown that such inequalities were indeed violated in practice&nbsp;\u2013 so that there were in fact correlations of the kind suggested by quantum mechanics.

Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an [[Quantum entanglement|entangled state]]. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]]'s experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], these \"parallel universes\" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] with ''both'' the physicist who measured it ''and'' a huge number of other particles, some of which are [[photon]]s flying away at the [[speed of light]] towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring ''all'' these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one ''could'' theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory).\n\nIn light of the [[Bell test]]s, Cramer in 1986 formulated his [[transactional interpretation]]<ref name=\"Cramer\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title = The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal = Reviews of Modern Physics|volume = 58|issue = 3|pages = 647\u2013687|year = 1986|last1 = Cramer|first1 = John G.|bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C}}</ref> which is unique in providing a physical explanation for the [[Born rule]].<ref>The Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into [[Ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bonding]] processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others and the magnitudes of the energies involved.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdXU6SD4_UYC |title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics with Applications to Chemistry |date= 1985|accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9780486648712|last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |authorlink1= Linus Pauling|last2=Wilson |first2=Edgar Bright |authorlink2= Edgar Bright Wilson}}</ref> Furthermore, most of the calculations performed in modern [[computational chemistry]] rely on quantum mechanics.\n\nIn many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant.\nImportant applications of quantum theory include [[quantum chemistry]], [[quantum optics]], [[quantum computing]], [[superconducting magnet]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s, the [[optical amplifier]] and the [[laser]], the [[transistor]] and [[semiconductor]]s such as the [[microprocessor]], [[medical imaging|medical and research imaging]] such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Matson|first1=John|title=What Is Quantum Mechanics Good for?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/everyday-quantum-physics/|magazine=Scientific American|accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref> Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule [[DNA]].<ref>The Nobel laureates Watson and Crick cited {{cite book |last= Pauling |first= Linus |authorlink= Linus Pauling |year= 1939 |title= The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals |publisher= [[Cornell University Press]]}} for chemical bond lengths, angles, and orientations.</ref>\n\n===Electronics===\nMany modern electronic devices are designed using quantum mechanics. Examples include the [[laser]], the [[transistor]] (and thus the [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]), the [[electron microscope]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). The study of [[semiconductor]]s led to the invention of the [[diode]] and the [[transistor]], which are indispensable parts of modern [[electronics]] systems, [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]] devices. Another application is for making laser diode and [[light emitting diode]] which are a high-efficiency source of light.\n\n[[File:Rtd seq v3.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|A working mechanism of a [[resonant tunneling diode]] device, based on the phenomenon of [[quantum tunneling]] through [[potential barrier]]s. (Left: [[band diagram]]; Center: [[transmission coefficient]]; Right: current-voltage characteristics) As shown in the band diagram(left), although there are two barriers, electrons still tunnel through via the confined states between two barriers(center), conducting current.]]\n\nMany electronic devices operate under effect of [[quantum tunneling]]. It even exists in the simple [[light switch]]. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. [[Flash memory]] chips found in [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as [[resonant tunneling diode]]. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by [[resonant tunneling]] through two or more [[potential barrier]]s (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to [[Fermi level]], tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum  mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such electronic devices.\n\n===Cryptography===\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop [[quantum cryptography]], which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information.\n\nAn inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to classical [[cryptography]] is the detection of passive [[eavesdropping]]. This is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an [[eigenstate]]. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|date=1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471117094|page=554|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Quantum computing===\nAnother goal is the development of [[quantum computer]]s, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical [[computer]]s. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use [[qubits]], which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. Quantum programmers are able to  manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or [[integer factorization]]. [[IBM]] claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, [[artificial intelligence]] and cloud security.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Quantum Computing|url=https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/quantum-computing-applications/|website=research.ibm.com|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother active research topic is [[quantum teleportation]], which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\n\n===Macroscale quantum effects===\nWhile quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit [[Mechanics#Classical versus quantum|quantum mechanical effects]] on a large scale. [[Superfluidity]], the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near [[absolute zero]], is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of [[superconductivity]], the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an [[electric current]]) at sufficiently low temperatures. The [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] is a [[topological order]]ed state which corresponds to patterns of long-range [[quantum entanglement]].<ref name=chen>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

It has also given insight into the workings of many different [[biological systems]], including [[smell receptors]] and [[protein structure]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Mark |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/13-is-quantum-mechanics-controlling-your-thoughts/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C |title=Is Quantum Mechanics Controlling Your Thoughts? &#124; Subatomic Particles |publisher=Discover Magazine |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Recent work on [[photosynthesis]] has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41632 |title=Quantum mechanics boosts photosynthesis |publisher=physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> Even so, [[classical physics]] can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large [[quantum number]]s. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Free particle===\nFor example, consider a [[free particle]]. In quantum mechanics, a free matter is described by a wave function.  The particle properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its position and velocity.  The wave properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference.  The [[wave\u2013particle duality]] feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators in the formulation of quantum mechanics.  Since the matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be represented as a [[wave]] of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a [[wave function]]. The position and momentum of the particle are [[observables]]. The [[Uncertainty Principle]] states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one ''can'' measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function that is very large (a [[Dirac delta]]) at a particular position ''x'', and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wave function, the resultant ''x'' will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position&nbsp;\u2013 or, stated in mathematical terms, a ''generalized position eigenstate ([[Distribution (mathematics)|eigendistribution]])''. If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=Quantum Mechanics, Second edition\n|first1=P.C.W.\n|last1=Davies\n|first2=David S.\n|last2=Betts\n|publisher=Chapman and Hall\n|year=1984\n|isbn=978-0-7487-4446-6\n|page=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79 Chapter 6, p. 79\n</ref>\nIn an eigenstate of momentum having a [[plane wave]] form, it can be shown that the [[wavelength]] is equal to ''h/p'', where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum of the [[eigenstate]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKm-Ekwke_UC |title=The Future of Complexity: Conceiving a Better Way to Understand Order and Chaos|first= Peter|last= Baofu|date= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9789812708991|bibcode=2007fccb.book.....B}}</ref>\n\n===Particle in a box===\n[[File:Infinite potential well.svg|thumb|1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)]]\n{{Main|Particle in a box}}\nThe particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels.

Some of the trajectories (such as C, D, E, and F) are [[standing wave]]s (or \"[[stationary state]]s\"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible [[energy level]] of the oscillator.

Formally, these vectors are elements of a [[complex number|complex]] [[Separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]]&nbsp;\u2013 variously called the [[State space (physics)|''state space'']] or the ''associated Hilbert space'' of the system&nbsp;\u2013 that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the [[projective space]] of a Hilbert space, usually called the [[complex projective space]]. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the state space for position and momentum states is the space of [[square-integrable]] functions, while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each observable is represented by a maximally [[Hermitian adjoint|Hermitian]] (precisely: by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]) linear [[Operator (physics)|operator]] acting on the state space. Each [[eigenstate]] of an observable corresponds to an [[eigenvector]] of the operator, and the associated [[eigenvalue]] corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can attain only those discrete eigenvalues.\n\nIn the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given time is described by a [[complex number|complex]] [[wave function]], also referred to as state vector in a complex [[vector space]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics Symmetries, Second edition|first1=Walter|last1=Greiner|first2=Berndt|last2=M\u00fcller|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|isbn=978-3-540-58080-5|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gCfvWx6vuzUC&pg=PA52 Chapter 1, p. 52]</ref> This abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of [[probability|probabilities]] of outcomes of concrete experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make simultaneous predictions of [[conjugate variables]], such as position and momentum, to arbitrary precision. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant probability density, often referred to as \"clouds\", may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the most probability. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] quantifies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p08a.htm |title=Heisenberg \u2013 Quantum Mechanics, 1925\u20131927: The Uncertainty Relations |publisher=Aip.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement, the wave function containing the probability information for a system [[Collapse of the wavefunction|collapses]] from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the observable&nbsp;\u2013 which explains the choice of ''Hermitian'' operators, for which all the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the [[spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]] of the corresponding operator. Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]] is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not [[Commutator|commute]].\n\nThe [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates]], in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of [[thought experiment]]s. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a \"measurement\" has been extensively studied. Newer [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]] have been formulated that do away with the concept of \"[[Collapse of the wavefunction|wave function collapse]]\" (see, for example, the [[relative state interpretation]]). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become [[Quantum Entanglement|entangled]], so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity. For details, see the article on [[measurement in quantum mechanics]].<ref name=\"google215\">{{cite book|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Second edition|first1=George|last1=Greenstein|first2=Arthur|last2=Zajonc|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Inc|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5t0tm0FB1CsC&pg=PA215}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5t0tm0FB1CsC&pg=PA215 Chapter 8, p. 215]\n</ref>\n\nGenerally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it makes a prediction using a [[probability distribution]]; that is, it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate (but better than [[Bohr model|the Bohr model]]) whereby electron location is given by a [[probability function]], the [[wave function]] [[eigenvalue]], such that the probability is the squared modulus of the [[probability amplitude|complex amplitude]], or [[quantum state]] nuclear attraction.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lodha |first1=Suresh K. |last2=Faaland |first2=Nikolai M. |last3=Charaniya |first3=Amin P. |last4=Varshney |first4=Pramod K. |last5=Mehrotra |first5=Kishan |last6=Mohan |first6=Chilukuri |display-authors=2 |title=Visualization of Uncertain Particle Movement (Proceeding Computer Graphics and Imaging) |url=ftp://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/.zfs/snapshot/2014-01-01/pub/lodha/papers/cgim2002.pdf |publisher=Actapress.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801014205/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7a4/ae7e57164c4afd726b567f863cce94ba9f86.pdf |archivedate=2018-08-01 |date=2002 |access-date=2018-08-01 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Dark Side of the Force: Economic Foundations of Conflict Theory|first1=Jack|last1=Hirshleifer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80412-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 265]|url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs|url-access=registration}}, [https://archive.org/details/darksideofforcee00hirs/page/265 Chapter, p. ]</ref> Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the \"instant\" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value. There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular observable. These are known as [[eigenstate]]s of the observable (\"eigen\" can be translated from German as meaning \"inherent\" or \"characteristic\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/eigen.html|title=dict.cc dictionary :: eigen :: German-English translation|date=|work=dict.cc|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are [[Conjugate variables|conjugate pairs]]) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs).  Rather, it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having ''[[Uncertainty principle|uncertain]]'' values and states having ''definite'' values (eigenstates).\n\nUsually, a system will not be in an [[eigenstate]] of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wave function will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or \"generalized\" eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as [[wave function collapse]], a controversial and much-debated process<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |title=Topics: Wave-Function Collapse |publisher=Phy.olemiss.edu |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228044927/http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/qm/collapse.html |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.\n\nFor example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a [[wave packet]] centered around some mean position ''x''<sub>0</sub> (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result.<ref name=\"google215\"/> It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near ''x''<sub>0</sub>, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result ''x'', the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at ''x''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/qmech/lectures/node28.html |title=Collapse of the wave-function |publisher=Farside.ph.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is described by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], in which the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (the [[Operator (physics)|operator]] corresponding to the [[total energy]] of the system) generates the time evolution. The [[time evolution]] of wave functions is [[determinism|deterministic]] in the sense that&nbsp;\u2013 given a wave function at an ''initial'' time&nbsp;\u2013 it makes a definite prediction of what the wave function will be at any ''later'' time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dreams Of A Final Theory: The Search for The Fundamental Laws of Nature |first1=Steven |last1=Weinberg |publisher=Random House |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4070-6396-6 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLrZkgPsZR0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=OLrZkgPsZR0C&pg=PT82 Extract of page 82]</ref>\n\nDuring a [[quantum measurement|measurement]], on the other hand, the change of the initial wave function into another, later wave function is not deterministic, it is unpredictable (i.e., [[random]]).

The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] describes how wave functions change in time, playing a role similar to [[Newton's second law]] in [[classical mechanics]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Textbook of Quantum Mechanics|first1=Piravonu Mathews|last1=Mathews|first2=K.|last2=Venkatesan|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-096510-2|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_qzs1DD3TcsC&pg=PA36 Chapter 2, p. 36]</ref>\n\n[[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Fig. 1: [[Probability density function|Probability densities]] corresponding to the wave functions of an electron in a hydrogen atom possessing definite energy levels (increasing from the top of the image to the bottom: ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ...) and angular momenta (increasing across from left to right: ''s'', ''p'', ''d'', ...). Denser areas correspond to higher probability density in a position measurement. Such wave functions are directly comparable to [[Chladni's figures]] of [[acoustics|acoustic]] modes of vibration in [[classical physics]] and are modes of oscillation as well, possessing a sharp [[energy]] and thus, a definite [[frequency]].

Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single [[electron]] in an unexcited [[atom]] is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the [[atomic nucleus]], whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static, [[spherical coordinate system|spherically symmetric]] wave function surrounding the nucleus ([[:File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spd m0.png|Fig. 1]]) (however, only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled ''s'', are spherically symmetric.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.ukzn.ac.za/~petruccione/Phys120/Wave%20Functions%20and%20the%20Schr%F6dinger%20Equation.pdf |title=Wave Functions and the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation acts on the ''entire'' probability amplitude, not merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its [[phase (waves)|phase]] encodes information about the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between quantum states. This gives rise to the \"wave-like\" behavior of quantum states.\n\nAnalytic solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are known for [[List of quantum-mechanical systems with analytical solutions|very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians]] including the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]], the [[particle in a box]], the [[dihydrogen cation]], and the [[hydrogen atom]]. Even the [[helium]] atom&nbsp;\u2013 which contains just two electrons&nbsp;\u2013 has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment.\n\nHowever, there are techniques for finding approximate solutions. One method, called [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak [[potential energy]]. Another method is called \"semi-classical equation of motion\", which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. This approach is particularly important in the field of [[quantum chaos]].\n\n==Mathematically equivalent formulations==\nThere are many mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. One of the oldest and most common is the \"[[transformation theory (quantum mechanics)|transformation theory]]\" proposed by [[Paul Dirac]], which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics&nbsp;\u2013 [[matrix mechanics]] (invented by [[Werner Heisenberg]]) and [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] (invented by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]]).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/fulltext?series=Reg&vol=19&page=683\n |title= Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and the creation of wave mechanics |journal= [[Acta Physica Polonica B]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages= 683\u2013695\n |format=PDF\n |last= Rechenberg |first= Helmut |year= 1987 |accessdate=13 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nEspecially since Heisenberg was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics, the role of [[Max Born]] in the development of QM was overlooked until the 1954 Nobel award. The role is noted in a 2005 biography of Born, which recounts his role in the matrix formulation and the use of probability amplitudes. Heisenberg acknowledges having learned matrices from Born, as published in a 1940 ''[[festschrift]]'' honoring [[Max Planck]].<ref>Nancy Thorndike Greenspan, \"The End of the Certain World: The Life and Science of Max Born\" (Basic Books, 2005), pp. 124\u2013128, 285\u2013826.</ref>  In the matrix formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the probabilities of its measurable properties, or \"[[observable]]s\". Examples of observables include [[energy operator|energy]], [[position operator|position]], [[momentum operator|momentum]], and [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum]].

This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the [[action principle]] in classical mechanics.\n\n==Relation to other scientific theories==\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state space of a system is a [[Hilbert space]] (crucially, that the space has an [[inner product]]) and that observables of the system are [[Hermitian operators]] acting on vectors in that space&nbsp;\u2013 although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An important guide for making these choices is the [[correspondence principle]], which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or, equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems. This \"high energy\" limit is known as the ''classical'' or ''correspondence limit''. One can even start from an established classical model of a particular system, then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|In the [[correspondence limit]] of '''quantum mechanics''': Is there a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics? How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the \"[[superposition principle|superposition]] of states\" and \"[[wave function collapse]]\", give rise to the reality we perceive?}}\nWhen quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was [[theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] [[classical mechanics]]. For instance, the well-known model of the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the [[kinetic energy]] of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]].\n\nEarly attempts to merge quantum mechanics with [[special relativity]] involved the replacement of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a covariant equation such as the [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] or the [[Dirac equation]]. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of [[quantum field theory]], which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, [[quantum electrodynamics]], provides a fully quantum description of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat [[electric charge|charged]] particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical [[electromagnetic field]]. For example, the elementary quantum model of the [[hydrogen atom]] describes the [[electric field]] of the hydrogen atom using a classical <math>\\textstyle -e^2/(4 \\pi\\epsilon_{_0}r)</math> [[Electric potential|Coulomb potential]]. This \"semi-classical\" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of [[photon]]s by [[charged particle]]s.\n\n[[Field (physics)|Quantum field]] theories for the [[strong nuclear force]] and the [[weak nuclear force]] have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called [[quantum chromodynamics]], and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s. The weak nuclear force and the [[electromagnetic force]] were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as [[electroweak theory]]), by the physicists [[Abdus Salam]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Steven Weinberg]].

In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bohr | first1 = N. | authorlink = Niels Bohr | year = 1928 | title = The Quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 121 | issue = 3050| pages = 580\u2013590 | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930).

It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a state as a physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition, with a definite trajectory of passage. [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] dynamics can be used for this. Classical kinematics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics.

However, the lack of a correct theory of [[quantum gravity]] is an important issue in [[physical cosmology]] and the search by physicists for an elegant \"[[theory of everything|Theory of Everything]]\" (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics. Many prominent physicists, including [[Stephen Hawking]], worked for many years to create a theory underlying ''everything''. This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]] \u2013 the [[strong interaction|strong force]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and [[gravity]] \u2013 from a single force or phenomenon. However, after considering [[G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem]], Hawking concluded that a theory of everything is not possible, and stated so publicly in his lecture \"G\u00f6del and the End of Physics\" (2002).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|title=Stephen Hawking; G\u00f6del and the end of physics|date=|work=cam.ac.uk|accessdate=11 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521123113/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/strings02/dirac/hawking/|archive-date=21 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Attempts at a unified field theory===\n{{Main|Grand unified theory}}\nThe quest to unify the [[fundamental force]]s through quantum mechanics is ongoing.

However&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  and while special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum electrodynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  the expanded [[general relativity]], currently the best theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory. One of those searching for a coherent TOE is [[Edward Witten]], a theoretical physicist who formulated the [[M-theory]], which is an attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based [[string theory]]. M-theory posits that our apparent [[4-dimensional spacetime]] is, in reality, actually an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are \u2013 at lower energies \u2013 completely \"compactified\" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable to measurement or probing.\n\nAnother popular theory is [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG) proposed by [[Carlo Rovelli]], that describes quantum properties of gravity. It is also a theory of [[quantum spacetime]] and [[Chronon|quantum time]], because in general relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of [[gravity]]. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard [[general relativity]]. This theory describes space as granular analogous to the granularity of photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism and the discrete energy levels of atoms. More precisely, space is an extremely fine fabric or networks \"woven\" of finite loops called [[spin networks]]. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The predicted size of this structure is the [[Planck length]], which is approximately 1.616\u00d710<sup>\u221235</sup> m. According to this theory, there is no meaning to length shorter than this (cf. [[Planck scale]] energy).\n\n==Philosophical implications==\n{{Main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nSince its inception, the many [[counter-intuitive]] aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong [[philosophy|philosophical]] debates and many [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]]. Even fundamental issues, such as [[Max Born]]'s basic [[Born rule|rules]] about [[probability amplitude]]s and [[probability distribution]]s, took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists. [[Richard Feynman]] once said, \"I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\"<ref>The Character of Physical Law (1965) Ch. 6; also quoted in The New Quantum Universe (2003), by Tony Hey and Patrick Walters</ref>  According to [[Steven Weinberg]], \"There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1109.6462|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.85.062116|title = Collapse of the state vector|journal = Physical Review A|volume = 85|issue = 6|pages = 062116|year = 2012|last1 = Weinberg|first1 = Steven|bibcode = 2012PhRvA..85f2116W}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]]&nbsp;\u2013 due largely to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg&nbsp;\u2013 remains most widely accepted some 75 years after its enunciation. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a ''temporary'' feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a ''final'' renunciation of the classical idea of \"causality\". It also states that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the [[complementarity (physics)|conjugate]] nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations.\n\nAlbert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of [[determinism]] and of [[causality]]. He famously said about this, \"God does not play with dice\".<ref name=\"Harrison2000\">{{cite book|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Robert Harrison|last=Harrison|title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&pg=PA239|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66148-5|page=239}}</ref> He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or how it might be observed. That view is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state, which does not depend on the configuration space for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. Einstein also believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against [[action at a distance]]; in other words, he insisted on the [[principle of locality]]. He considered, but rejected on theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He believed that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances, and would not come quickly or easily. The [[Bohr-Einstein debates]] provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an [[epistemological]] point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a series of objections, of which the most famous has become known as the [[Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox]].\n\n[[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this [[EPR paradox]] led to [[Bell's theorem|experimentally testable differences]] between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables. [[Bell test experiments|Experiments]] confirmed the accuracy of quantum mechanics, thereby showing that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon by addition of hidden variables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-action-distance/ |title=Action at a Distance in Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982 and many later experiments definitively verified quantum entanglement. Entanglement, as demonstrated in Bell-type experiments, does not violate [[causality]], since it does not involve transfer of information.  By the early 1980s, experiments had shown that such inequalities were indeed violated in practice&nbsp;\u2013 so that there were in fact correlations of the kind suggested by quantum mechanics. At first these just seemed like isolated esoteric effects, but by the mid-1990s, they were being codified in the field of quantum information theory, and led to constructions with names like [[quantum cryptography]] and [[quantum teleportation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1058 1058]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1058}}</ref> [[Quantum cryptography]] is proposed for use in high-security applications in banking and government.\n\nThe [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]], formulated in 1956, holds that ''all'' the possibilities described by quantum theory ''simultaneously'' occur in a [[multiverse]] composed of mostly independent parallel universes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-everett/ |title=Everett's Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> This is not accomplished by introducing a \"new axiom\" to quantum mechanics, but by ''removing'' the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet.

Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an [[Quantum entanglement|entangled state]]. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.e., the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we, as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent with [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]]'s experiments and makes them intuitively understandable. However, according to the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], these \"parallel universes\" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system becomes [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] with ''both'' the physicist who measured it ''and'' a huge number of other particles, some of which are [[photon]]s flying away at the [[speed of light]] towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring ''all'' these particles back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one ''could'' theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory).\n\nIn light of the [[Bell test]]s, Cramer in 1986 formulated his [[transactional interpretation]]<ref name=\"Cramer\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title = The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|journal = Reviews of Modern Physics|volume = 58|issue = 3|pages = 647\u2013687|year = 1986|last1 = Cramer|first1 = John G.|bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C}}</ref> which is unique in providing a physical explanation for the [[Born rule]].<ref>The Transactional Interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Examples include the [[laser]], the [[transistor]] (and thus the [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]), the [[electron microscope]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). The study of [[semiconductor]]s led to the invention of the [[diode]] and the [[transistor]], which are indispensable parts of modern [[electronics]] systems, [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]] devices.

It even exists in the simple [[light switch]]. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. [[Flash memory]] chips found in [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as [[resonant tunneling diode]]. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by [[resonant tunneling]] through two or more [[potential barrier]]s (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to [[Fermi level]], tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum  mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such electronic devices.\n\n===Cryptography===\nResearchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop [[quantum cryptography]], which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information.\n\nAn inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to classical [[cryptography]] is the detection of passive [[eavesdropping]]. This is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an [[eigenstate]]. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|date=1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471117094|page=554|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n===Quantum computing===\nAnother goal is the development of [[quantum computer]]s, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical [[computer]]s. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use [[qubits]], which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. Quantum programmers are able to  manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or [[integer factorization]]. [[IBM]] claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, [[artificial intelligence]] and cloud security.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Quantum Computing|url=https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/quantum-computing-applications/|website=research.ibm.com|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother active research topic is [[quantum teleportation]], which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.\n\n===Macroscale quantum effects===\nWhile quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit [[Mechanics#Classical versus quantum|quantum mechanical effects]] on a large scale. [[Superfluidity]], the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near [[absolute zero]], is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of [[superconductivity]], the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an [[electric current]]) at sufficiently low temperatures.

Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Free particle===\nFor example, consider a [[free particle]]. In quantum mechanics, a free matter is described by a wave function.  The particle properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its position and velocity.  The wave properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference.  The [[wave\u2013particle duality]] feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators in the formulation of quantum mechanics.  Since the matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be represented as a [[wave]] of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a [[wave function]]. The position and momentum of the particle are [[observables]]. The [[Uncertainty Principle]] states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one ''can'' measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function that is very large (a [[Dirac delta]]) at a particular position ''x'', and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wave function, the resultant ''x'' will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position&nbsp;\u2013 or, stated in mathematical terms, a ''generalized position eigenstate ([[Distribution (mathematics)|eigendistribution]])''. If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=Quantum Mechanics, Second edition\n|first1=P.C.W.\n|last1=Davies\n|first2=David S.\n|last2=Betts\n|publisher=Chapman and Hall\n|year=1984\n|isbn=978-0-7487-4446-6\n|page=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyHCrGNstoC&pg=PA79 Chapter 6, p. 79\n</ref>\nIn an eigenstate of momentum having a [[plane wave]] form, it can be shown that the [[wavelength]] is equal to ''h/p'', where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum of the [[eigenstate]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKm-Ekwke_UC |title=The Future of Complexity: Conceiving a Better Way to Understand Order and Chaos|first= Peter|last= Baofu|date= 2007|accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9789812708991|bibcode=2007fccb.book.....B}}</ref>\n\n===Particle in a box===\n[[File:Infinite potential well.svg|thumb|1-dimensional potential energy box (or infinite potential well)]]\n{{Main|Particle in a box}}\nThe particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels.

At <math>x=L</math>,\n\n:<math> \\psi(L) = 0 = C\\sin(kL),</math>\n\nin which <math>C</math> cannot be zero as this would conflict with the Born interpretation.

In quantum mechanics, the position of the ball is represented by a [[wave]] (called the [[wave function]]), with the [[real part]] shown in blue and the [[imaginary part]] shown in red. Some of the trajectories (such as C, D, E, and F) are [[standing wave]]s (or \"[[stationary state]]s\"). Each standing-wave frequency is proportional to a possible [[energy level]] of the oscillator. This \"energy quantization\" does not occur in classical physics, where the oscillator can have ''any'' energy.]]\n\nAs in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by\n\n:<math>V(x)=\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2.</math>\n\nThis problem can either be treated by directly solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant \"ladder method\" first proposed by Paul Dirac.

It takes up the extreme northeast of the borough, and as such is the closest part of the borough to central London. It is centred {{convert|5.3|mi|km|1}} west south-west of [[Charing Cross]] in a bend of the [[River Thames]].\n\nIts built environment includes a wide variety of convenience and arts shopping on its [[high street]] and a high proportion of 18th- and 19th-century buildings in the streets near Barnes Pond. Together they make up the Barnes Village [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]] where along with its west riverside, pictured, most of the mid-19th century properties are concentrated. On the east riverside is the [[WWT London Wetland Centre]] adjoining several fields for the three main national team sports. Barnes has retained woodland on the \"Barnes Trail\" which is a short circular walk taking in the riverside, commercial streets and conservation area, marked by silver discs set in the ground and with [[QR code]]d information on distinctive oar signs. The [[Thames Path National Trail]] provides a public [[Esplanade|promenade]] along the entire bend of the river which is on the [[Championship Course]] in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Barnes has two railway stations (Barnes and Barnes Bridge) and is served by bus routes towards central London and [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].\n\n==Geography and transport==\n[[File:Hammersmith Bridge 2008 06 19.jpg|thumb|[[Hammersmith Bridge]]]]Barnes is in [[South West (London sub region)|south west London]], bounded to the west, north and east by a [[meander]] in the [[River Thames]].\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n==== National Rail ====\nBarnes is not on the [[London Underground]] network. However, it is served directly by two [[National Rail]] stations, both of which are in [[Travelcard Zone 3|London's Travelcard Zone 3]]:\n\n* '''[[Barnes railway station]]'''\n* '''[[Barnes Bridge railway station]]'''\n\nBoth stations are served exclusively by trains operated by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway (SWR)]], with trains terminating in [[Central London]] at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]] via [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]. Trains from Barnes and Barnes Bridge both run eastwards providing Barnes with a direct connection to [[Chiswick railway station|Chiswick]], [[Brentford railway station|Brentford]] and [[Hounslow railway station|Hounslow]]. Barnes railway station is also served by trains running southwest towards [[Teddington railway station|Teddington]] and [[Kingston railway station (England)|Kingston]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf|title=London's Rail and Tube services|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410113009/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf|archive-date=April 10, 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBarnes railway station saw 2.548 million passenger entries or exits last year.

From Hammersmith, there are direct connections to [[City of London|the City]] and [[West End of London|the West End]]. There are also direct connections to [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Ealing]], [[East End of London|the East End]] and [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayner's Lane]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Road ===\nThere is one [[Thames crossings|River Thames crossing]] in Barnes for traffic and pedestrians; [[Hammersmith Bridge]] is a [[suspension bridge]] to the north of Barnes, built in 1887. Hammersmith Bridge is currently closed indefinitely to traffic due to structural faults.\n\nMany of the roads in Barnes are residential, but several [[Arterial road|arterial routes]] pass through the district, carrying traffic across London and the [[South East England|South East]].\n\nThe [[South Circular Road, London|'''South Circular Road''']] ('''A205''') passes through the southern end of Barnes. The South Circular carries traffic eastbound towards [[Wandsworth]], [[Clapham]], [[City of London|the City of London]] and [[South East (London sub region)|south east London]]. Westbound, the road carries traffic away from Central London, either towards [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] and [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|the M3]], or directly to [[M4 motorway|the M4]] and the [[North Circular Road|North Circular Road (A406)]]. [[Kew]] and [[Chiswick]] are ''en route'' to the M4.\n\nThe [[A306 road|'''A306''']] runs north-south through Barnes, carried by [[Castelnau, London|Castelnau]] and Rocks Lane. Leaving Barnes to the north, the A306 crosses Hammersmith Bridge towards [[Hammersmith]], where traffic meets the [[Great West Road, London, England|Great West Road (A4)]], which links to [[Earl's Court]] and [[West End of London|the West End]]. Southbound, the A306 eventually meets [[A3 road|the A3]] towards [[Guildford]] and [[Portsmouth]].\n\nBarnes High Street and Church Road carry the '''[[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A3003]],''' which runs between Barnes and nearby [[Mortlake]].\n\n[[Transport for London|Transport for London (TfL)]] manages the South Circular Road and the A306 (south of Barnes only).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-base-map-master.pdf|title=TfL Base Map|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Transport for London]] (TfL)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407204454/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-base-map-master.pdf|archive-date=April 7, 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther roads which cross the Thames nearby are [[Chiswick Bridge]] ([[A316 road|A316]]) to the west and [[Putney Bridge]] ([[A219 road|A219]]) east.\n\n==== Air pollution ====\nThe London Borough of Richmond upon Thames carries out air pollution monitoring in Barnes, both kerbside and in the [[London Wetlands Centre]]. There are several sites in Barnes which measure the concentration of [[Nitrogen dioxide|Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)]] and [[Particulate Matter|Particulate Matter (PM10)]] in the air.\n\nA site along Castelnau recorded an annual mean concentration of NO2 at 31\u03bcgm-3 in 2017. The annual mean concentration of PM10 was 18\u03bcgm-3 at the same site in the same year. Both results show that Barnes' air is the cleanest it has been since 2011, at least. Whilst Castelnau is on the kerbside, the Wetlands monitoring site recorded far lower (i.e. cleaner) results than Castelnau did in 2017, with an annual mean NO2 concentration at 21\u03bcgm-3, and a mean reading of 15\u03bcgm-3 for PM10. A monitoring site on Barnes High Street recorded more polluted air than the other, with NO2 levels at 43.0\u03bcgm-3 (annual mean, 2017). This site therefore failed to meet the UK National Air Quality Objective of 40\u03bcgm-3 (annual mean) for NO2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/15932/air_quality_annual_status_report_2018.pdf|title=London Borough of Richmond upon Thames: Air Quality Annual Status Report for 2017|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2018|website=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413014052/https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/15932/air_quality_annual_status_report_2018.pdf|archive-date=April 13, 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nBarnes is served by [[London Buses]] 33, 72, 209, 265, 283, 378, 419, 485 and N22.\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCompared other districts in London, Barnes is poorly connected to London destinations via [[Cycle-path|cycle paths]] or [[Cycle-track|tracks]]; [[cycling infrastructure]] is limited in Barnes.\n\nThere are three key routes which pass through Barnes:\n\n* '''[[National Cycle Route 4|National Cycle Route 4 (NCR 4)]]''' \u2013 this signed cycle route from [[Greenwich]] to [[Fishguard]], [[West Wales]], runs mainly on shared-use paths or residential streets but, in Barnes, the route follows Rocks Lane (A306) for a short distance.

First, a former High Master of [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], [[Richard Mulcaster]], is credited with taking [[mob football]] and turning it into an organised, [[referee]]d team sport that was considered beneficial for schoolboys. St Paul's School is currently sited on Lonsdale Road, although in Mulcaster's time it was at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in the [[City of London]].\n\nBarnes was also home to [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], who in 1862 was a founding member of [[the Football Association]]. In 1863, he wrote to ''[[Bell's Life in London|Bell's Life]]'' newspaper proposing a governing body for football, and this led to the first meeting at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] where the FA was created. He was the FA's first secretary (1863\u201366) and at his home in Barnes he set out the first set of rules for modern football, and these were adopted by the FA and subsequently spread throughout the world. As a player, he took part in the first match played according to today's rules. Morley may be considered the father of football for his key role in establishing modern [[Association Football]].\n\nBarnes has a [[non-League football]] club, [[Stonewall F.C.]], who play at Barn Elms Playing Fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://72.3.224.252/ClubList.cfm?fmTeamID=123276&LeagueCode=MDX2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810220937/http://72.3.224.252/ClubList.cfm?fmTeamID=123276&LeagueCode=MDX2010 |url-status = dead|archive-date=10 August 2011 |publisher=football.mitoo |title=Stonewall |work=Club Information |accessdate=31 May 2015 }}</ref>\n;Rugby\n[[Barnes Rugby Football Club]]'s ground is next to the WWT London Wetlands Centre, formerly known simply as Barn Elms.\n;Rowing\nIn [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], the loop of the Thames surrounding Barnes forms part of [[the Championship Course]] used for the [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]] and the main national [[head race]]s, the [[Head of the River Race]]s, for each category of Olympic boat.

It takes up the extreme northeast of the borough, and as such is the closest part of the borough to central London. It is centred {{convert|5.3|mi|km|1}} west south-west of [[Charing Cross]] in a bend of the [[River Thames]].\n\nIts built environment includes a wide variety of convenience and arts shopping on its [[high street]] and a high proportion of 18th- and 19th-century buildings in the streets near Barnes Pond. Together they make up the Barnes Village [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]] where along with its west riverside, pictured, most of the mid-19th century properties are concentrated. On the east riverside is the [[WWT London Wetland Centre]] adjoining several fields for the three main national team sports. Barnes has retained woodland on the \"Barnes Trail\" which is a short circular walk taking in the riverside, commercial streets and conservation area, marked by silver discs set in the ground and with [[QR code]]d information on distinctive oar signs. The [[Thames Path National Trail]] provides a public [[Esplanade|promenade]] along the entire bend of the river which is on the [[Championship Course]] in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Barnes has two railway stations (Barnes and Barnes Bridge) and is served by bus routes towards central London and [[Richmond, London|Richmond]].\n\n==Geography and transport==\n[[File:Hammersmith Bridge 2008 06 19.jpg|thumb|[[Hammersmith Bridge]]]]Barnes is in [[South West (London sub region)|south west London]], bounded to the west, north and east by a [[meander]] in the [[River Thames]].\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n==== National Rail ====\nBarnes is not on the [[London Underground]] network. However, it is served directly by two [[National Rail]] stations, both of which are in [[Travelcard Zone 3|London's Travelcard Zone 3]]:\n\n* '''[[Barnes railway station]]'''\n* '''[[Barnes Bridge railway station]]'''\n\nBoth stations are served exclusively by trains operated by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway (SWR)]], with trains terminating in [[Central London]] at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]] via [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]. Trains from Barnes and Barnes Bridge both run eastwards providing Barnes with a direct connection to [[Chiswick railway station|Chiswick]], [[Brentford railway station|Brentford]] and [[Hounslow railway station|Hounslow]]. Barnes railway station is also served by trains running southwest towards [[Teddington railway station|Teddington]] and [[Kingston railway station (England)|Kingston]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf|title=London's Rail and Tube services|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410113009/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf|archive-date=April 10, 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBarnes railway station saw 2.548 million passenger entries or exits last year.

From Hammersmith, there are direct connections to [[City of London|the City]] and [[West End of London|the West End]]. There are also direct connections to [[Heathrow Airport]], [[Ealing]], [[East End of London|the East End]] and [[Rayners Lane tube station|Rayner's Lane]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Road ===\nThere is one [[Thames crossings|River Thames crossing]] in Barnes for traffic and pedestrians; [[Hammersmith Bridge]] is a [[suspension bridge]] to the north of Barnes, built in 1887. Hammersmith Bridge is currently closed indefinitely to traffic due to structural faults.\n\nMany of the roads in Barnes are residential, but several [[Arterial road|arterial routes]] pass through the district, carrying traffic across London and the [[South East England|South East]].\n\nThe [[South Circular Road, London|'''South Circular Road''']] ('''A205''') passes through the southern end of Barnes. The South Circular carries traffic eastbound towards [[Wandsworth]], [[Clapham]], [[City of London|the City of London]] and [[South East (London sub region)|south east London]]. Westbound, the road carries traffic away from Central London, either towards [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] and [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|the M3]], or directly to [[M4 motorway|the M4]] and the [[North Circular Road|North Circular Road (A406)]]. [[Kew]] and [[Chiswick]] are ''en route'' to the M4.\n\nThe [[A306 road|'''A306''']] runs north-south through Barnes, carried by [[Castelnau, London|Castelnau]] and Rocks Lane. Leaving Barnes to the north, the A306 crosses Hammersmith Bridge towards [[Hammersmith]], where traffic meets the [[Great West Road, London, England|Great West Road (A4)]], which links to [[Earl's Court]] and [[West End of London|the West End]]. Southbound, the A306 eventually meets [[A3 road|the A3]] towards [[Guildford]] and [[Portsmouth]].\n\nBarnes High Street and Church Road carry the '''[[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A3003]],''' which runs between Barnes and nearby [[Mortlake]].\n\n[[Transport for London|Transport for London (TfL)]] manages the South Circular Road and the A306 (south of Barnes only).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-base-map-master.pdf|title=TfL Base Map|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Transport for London]] (TfL)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407204454/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-base-map-master.pdf|archive-date=April 7, 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther roads which cross the Thames nearby are [[Chiswick Bridge]] ([[A316 road|A316]]) to the west and [[Putney Bridge]] ([[A219 road|A219]]) east.\n\n==== Air pollution ====\nThe London Borough of Richmond upon Thames carries out air pollution monitoring in Barnes, both kerbside and in the [[London Wetlands Centre]]. There are several sites in Barnes which measure the concentration of [[Nitrogen dioxide|Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)]] and [[Particulate Matter|Particulate Matter (PM10)]] in the air.\n\nA site along Castelnau recorded an annual mean concentration of NO2 at 31\u03bcgm-3 in 2017. The annual mean concentration of PM10 was 18\u03bcgm-3 at the same site in the same year. Both results show that Barnes' air is the cleanest it has been since 2011, at least. Whilst Castelnau is on the kerbside, the Wetlands monitoring site recorded far lower (i.e. cleaner) results than Castelnau did in 2017, with an annual mean NO2 concentration at 21\u03bcgm-3, and a mean reading of 15\u03bcgm-3 for PM10. A monitoring site on Barnes High Street recorded more polluted air than the other, with NO2 levels at 43.0\u03bcgm-3 (annual mean, 2017). This site therefore failed to meet the UK National Air Quality Objective of 40\u03bcgm-3 (annual mean) for NO2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/15932/air_quality_annual_status_report_2018.pdf|title=London Borough of Richmond upon Thames: Air Quality Annual Status Report for 2017|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2018|website=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413014052/https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/15932/air_quality_annual_status_report_2018.pdf|archive-date=April 13, 2019|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Buses ===\nBarnes is served by [[London Buses]] 33, 72, 209, 265, 283, 378, 419, 485 and N22.\n\n=== Cycling ===\nCompared other districts in London, Barnes is poorly connected to London destinations via [[Cycle-path|cycle paths]] or [[Cycle-track|tracks]]; [[cycling infrastructure]] is limited in Barnes.\n\nThere are three key routes which pass through Barnes:\n\n* '''[[National Cycle Route 4|National Cycle Route 4 (NCR 4)]]''' \u2013 this signed cycle route from [[Greenwich]] to [[Fishguard]], [[West Wales]], runs mainly on shared-use paths or residential streets but, in Barnes, the route follows Rocks Lane (A306) for a short distance.

St Paul's School is currently sited on Lonsdale Road, although in Mulcaster's time it was at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in the [[City of London]].\n\nBarnes was also home to [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], who in 1862 was a founding member of [[the Football Association]]. In 1863, he wrote to ''[[Bell's Life in London|Bell's Life]]'' newspaper proposing a governing body for football, and this led to the first meeting at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] where the FA was created. He was the FA's first secretary (1863\u201366) and at his home in Barnes he set out the first set of rules for modern football, and these were adopted by the FA and subsequently spread throughout the world. As a player, he took part in the first match played according to today's rules. Morley may be considered the father of football for his key role in establishing modern [[Association Football]].\n\nBarnes has a [[non-League football]] club, [[Stonewall F.C.]], who play at Barn Elms Playing Fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://72.3.224.252/ClubList.cfm?fmTeamID=123276&LeagueCode=MDX2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810220937/http://72.3.224.252/ClubList.cfm?fmTeamID=123276&LeagueCode=MDX2010 |url-status = dead|archive-date=10 August 2011 |publisher=football.mitoo |title=Stonewall |work=Club Information |accessdate=31 May 2015 }}</ref>\n;Rugby\n[[Barnes Rugby Football Club]]'s ground is next to the WWT London Wetlands Centre, formerly known simply as Barn Elms.\n;Rowing\nIn [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], the loop of the Thames surrounding Barnes forms part of [[the Championship Course]] used for the [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]] and the main national [[head race]]s, the [[Head of the River Race]]s, for each category of Olympic boat.

Most species undergo submarine [[pollination]] and complete their life cycle underwater.\n\nSeagrasses beds/meadows can be either monospecific (made up of a single species) or in mixed beds. In [[temperate]] areas, usually one or a few species dominate (like the eelgrass ''[[Zostera marina]]'' in the North Atlantic), whereas [[tropical]] beds usually are more diverse, with up to thirteen [[species]] recorded in the [[Philippines]].\n\nSeagrass beds are diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s, and can harbor hundreds of associated species from all [[phylum|phyla]], for example juvenile and adult [[fish]], [[epiphytic]] and free-living [[macroalgae]] and [[microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s. Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific reviews and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is an important link in the food chain, feeding hundreds of species, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s. Some fish species that visit/feed on seagrasses raise their young in adjacent [[mangrove]]s or [[coral reef]]s.\n\nSeagrasses trap sediment and slow down water movement, causing suspended sediment to settle out. Trapping sediment benefits [[coral]] by reducing sediment loads, improving photosynthesis for both coral and seagrass.<ref>[http://www.seagrasswatch.org/seagrass.html Seagrass-Watch: What is seagrass?] Retrieved 2012-11-16.</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Charismatic fauna can also be seen visiting the seagrass habitats. These species include [[West Indian manatee]], [[green sea turtle]]s, and various species of sharks. The high diversity of marine organisms that can be found on seagrass habitats promotes them as a tourist attraction and a significant source of income for many coastal economies along the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean.\n\n==Relation to humans==\nHistorically, seagrasses were collected as [[fertilizer]] for sandy soil. This was an important use in the [[Aveiro Lagoon]], [[Portugal]], where the plants collected were known as [[moli\u00e7o]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, in France and, to a lesser extent, the [[Channel Islands]], dried seagrasses were used as a mattress (''paillasse'') filling - such mattresses were in high demand by French forces during [[World War I]]. It was also used for bandages and other purposes.\n\nIn February 2017, researchers found that seagrass meadows may be able to remove various pathogens from seawater. On small islands without wastewater treatment facilities in central Indonesia, levels of pathogenic marine bacteria \u2013 such as ''[[Enterococcus]]'' \u2013 that affect humans, fish and [[invertebrate]]s were reduced by 50 percent when seagrass meadows were present, compared to paired sites without seagrass,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nature.org/science/2017/02/17/new-science-shows-seagrass-meadows-have-disease-fighting-superpowers/|title=New Science Shows Seagrass Meadows Suppress Pathogens|last1=Byington|first1=Cara|website=Nature.org|publisher=NatureNet Fellows for Cool Green Science|accessdate=17 February 2017|date=2017-02-17}}</ref> although this could be a detriment to their survival.<ref name=\"Jones et al., 2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=BJ|last2=Cullen-Unsworth|first2=L.

Seagrasses display a high degree of [[phenotypic plasticity]], adapting rapidly to changing environmental conditions.\n\nSeagrasses are in global decline, with some {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} lost during recent decades. The main cause is human disturbance, most notably [[eutrophication]], mechanical destruction of habitat, and [[overfishing]]. Excessive input of nutrients ([[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]]) is directly toxic to seagrasses, but most importantly, it stimulates the growth of epiphytic and free-floating [[Seaweed|macro]]- and [[Microphyte|micro]]-[[algae]]. This weakens the [[sunlight]], reducing the [[photosynthesis]] that nourishes the seagrass and the [[primary production]] results.\n\nDecaying seagrass leaves and algae fuels increasing [[algal bloom]]s, resulting in a positive [[feedback]]. This can cause a complete [[regime shift]] from seagrass to algal dominance. Accumulating evidence also suggests that overfishing of top [[predator]]s (large predatory fish) could indirectly increase algal growth by reducing grazing control performed by [[mesograzer]]s, such as [[crustacean]]s and [[gastropod]]s, through a [[trophic cascade]].\n\n[[Algal bloom|Macroalgal blooms]] cause the decline and eradication of seagrasses. Known as nuisance species, macroalgae grow in filamentous and sheet-like forms and form thick unattached mats over seagrass, occurring as epiphytes on seagrass leaves. [[Eutrophication]] leads to the forming of a bloom, causing the attenuation of light in the water column, which eventually leads to anoxic conditions for the seagrass and organisms living in/around the plant(s). In addition to the direct blockage of light to the plant, benthic macroalgae have low carbon/nitrogen content, causing their decomposition to stimulate bacterial activity, leading to sediment resuspension, an increase in water turbidity and further light attenuation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McGlathery | first1 = KJ | year = 2001 | title = Macroalgal blooms contribute to the decline of seagrass in nutrient\u2010enriched coastal waters | url = http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/mcglathery/McG_Lab/Publications_files/McGlathery_JPhycology2001_Macroalgal%20blooms%20contribute%20to%20the%20decline%20of%20seagrass%20innutrient-enriched%20coastal%20waters.pdf | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 453\u2013456 | doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.037004453.x}}</ref><ref>Fox SE, YS Olsen and AC Spivak (2010) [http://aslo.org/books/ecodas8/ecodas8_129.pdf \"Effects of bottom-up and top-down controls and climate change on estuarine macrophyte communities and the ecosystem services they provide\"] In: PF Kemp (Ed) ''Eco-DAS Symposium Proceedings'', ALSO, Chapter 8: 129\u2013145.</ref>\n\nWhen humans drive motor boats over shallow seagrass areas, sometimes the propeller blade can damage the seagrass.\n\nThe most-used methods to protect and restore seagrass meadows include nutrient and [[pollution]] reduction, [[marine protected areas]] and restoration using seagrass [[transplanting]].

In [[temperate]] areas, usually one or a few species dominate (like the eelgrass ''[[Zostera marina]]'' in the North Atlantic), whereas [[tropical]] beds usually are more diverse, with up to thirteen [[species]] recorded in the [[Philippines]].\n\nSeagrass beds are diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s, and can harbor hundreds of associated species from all [[phylum|phyla]], for example juvenile and adult [[fish]], [[epiphytic]] and free-living [[macroalgae]] and [[microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s. Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific reviews and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is an important link in the food chain, feeding hundreds of species, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s. Some fish species that visit/feed on seagrasses raise their young in adjacent [[mangrove]]s or [[coral reef]]s.\n\nSeagrasses trap sediment and slow down water movement, causing suspended sediment to settle out. Trapping sediment benefits [[coral]] by reducing sediment loads, improving photosynthesis for both coral and seagrass.<ref>[http://www.seagrasswatch.org/seagrass.html Seagrass-Watch: What is seagrass?] Retrieved 2012-11-16.</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Charismatic fauna can also be seen visiting the seagrass habitats. These species include [[West Indian manatee]], [[green sea turtle]]s, and various species of sharks. The high diversity of marine organisms that can be found on seagrass habitats promotes them as a tourist attraction and a significant source of income for many coastal economies along the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean.\n\n==Relation to humans==\nHistorically, seagrasses were collected as [[fertilizer]] for sandy soil. This was an important use in the [[Aveiro Lagoon]], [[Portugal]], where the plants collected were known as [[moli\u00e7o]].\n\nIn the early 20th century, in France and, to a lesser extent, the [[Channel Islands]], dried seagrasses were used as a mattress (''paillasse'') filling - such mattresses were in high demand by French forces during [[World War I]]. It was also used for bandages and other purposes.\n\nIn February 2017, researchers found that seagrass meadows may be able to remove various pathogens from seawater. On small islands without wastewater treatment facilities in central Indonesia, levels of pathogenic marine bacteria \u2013 such as ''[[Enterococcus]]'' \u2013 that affect humans, fish and [[invertebrate]]s were reduced by 50 percent when seagrass meadows were present, compared to paired sites without seagrass,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nature.org/science/2017/02/17/new-science-shows-seagrass-meadows-have-disease-fighting-superpowers/|title=New Science Shows Seagrass Meadows Suppress Pathogens|last1=Byington|first1=Cara|website=Nature.org|publisher=NatureNet Fellows for Cool Green Science|accessdate=17 February 2017|date=2017-02-17}}</ref> although this could be a detriment to their survival.<ref name=\"Jones et al., 2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=BJ|last2=Cullen-Unsworth|first2=L.

Seagrasses display a high degree of [[phenotypic plasticity]], adapting rapidly to changing environmental conditions.\n\nSeagrasses are in global decline, with some {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} lost during recent decades. The main cause is human disturbance, most notably [[eutrophication]], mechanical destruction of habitat, and [[overfishing]]. Excessive input of nutrients ([[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]]) is directly toxic to seagrasses, but most importantly, it stimulates the growth of epiphytic and free-floating [[Seaweed|macro]]- and [[Microphyte|micro]]-[[algae]]. This weakens the [[sunlight]], reducing the [[photosynthesis]] that nourishes the seagrass and the [[primary production]] results.\n\nDecaying seagrass leaves and algae fuels increasing [[algal bloom]]s, resulting in a positive [[feedback]]. This can cause a complete [[regime shift]] from seagrass to algal dominance. Accumulating evidence also suggests that overfishing of top [[predator]]s (large predatory fish) could indirectly increase algal growth by reducing grazing control performed by [[mesograzer]]s, such as [[crustacean]]s and [[gastropod]]s, through a [[trophic cascade]].\n\n[[Algal bloom|Macroalgal blooms]] cause the decline and eradication of seagrasses. Known as nuisance species, macroalgae grow in filamentous and sheet-like forms and form thick unattached mats over seagrass, occurring as epiphytes on seagrass leaves. [[Eutrophication]] leads to the forming of a bloom, causing the attenuation of light in the water column, which eventually leads to anoxic conditions for the seagrass and organisms living in/around the plant(s). In addition to the direct blockage of light to the plant, benthic macroalgae have low carbon/nitrogen content, causing their decomposition to stimulate bacterial activity, leading to sediment resuspension, an increase in water turbidity and further light attenuation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McGlathery | first1 = KJ | year = 2001 | title = Macroalgal blooms contribute to the decline of seagrass in nutrient\u2010enriched coastal waters | url = http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/mcglathery/McG_Lab/Publications_files/McGlathery_JPhycology2001_Macroalgal%20blooms%20contribute%20to%20the%20decline%20of%20seagrass%20innutrient-enriched%20coastal%20waters.pdf | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 453\u2013456 | doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.037004453.x}}</ref><ref>Fox SE, YS Olsen and AC Spivak (2010) [http://aslo.org/books/ecodas8/ecodas8_129.pdf \"Effects of bottom-up and top-down controls and climate change on estuarine macrophyte communities and the ecosystem services they provide\"] In: PF Kemp (Ed) ''Eco-DAS Symposium Proceedings'', ALSO, Chapter 8: 129\u2013145.</ref>\n\nWhen humans drive motor boats over shallow seagrass areas, sometimes the propeller blade can damage the seagrass.\n\nThe most-used methods to protect and restore seagrass meadows include nutrient and [[pollution]] reduction, [[marine protected areas]] and restoration using seagrass [[transplanting]].
