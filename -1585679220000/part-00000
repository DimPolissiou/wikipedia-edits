{"title_page": "Western Rite Orthodoxy", "text_new": "{{short description|Congregations within the Eastern Orthodox Church which use liturgies of Western or Latin origin rather than adopting Eastern liturgies}}\n{{Use American English|date=December 2016}}\n{{Christianity|expanded=groupings}}\n'''Western Rite Orthodoxy''', '''Western Orthodoxy''', or '''Orthodox Western Rite''' are terms used to describe congregations that are within the [[Autocephaly|autocephalous church]]es of the canonical Orthodox Christian Church. These congregations have been blessed to use western liturgical forms such as the ancient Gregorian Liturgy, the Sarum (*the Salisbury Local use of the Gregorian), the Mozarabic and Gallican Liturgies. Some congregations are also blessed to use what has become known simply as the English Liturgy, which is derived from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer; albeit, with some modification to the text to emphasize Orthodox theological teaching. The Western Rite that exists today has been heavily influenced by the  life and work of [[Julian Joseph Overbeck]].\n\nWestern Rite missions, parishes and monasteries exist within certain jurisdictions of the canonical [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], predominantly within the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|Russian]] and [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Antiochian]] jurisdictions in North America. Both operate under a structure known as a \"vicariate\" within their respective [[Autocephaly|autocephalous church]]es. The Antiochian structure covers Western Rite parishes primarily in the United States while the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia has established parishes, missions and monasteries in the United Kingdom, Germany and Norway.\n\nIn addition, the Western Rite is practiced within religious communities outside the canonical Orthodox Church. The [[Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches|Communion of Western Orthodox Churches]] and the [[Orthodox Church of France]] are entirely Western Rite. Furthermore, there is a small number of Western Rite communities among the [[Old Calendarists]], such as the former Western Rite Exarchate of the [[Holy Synod of Milan]] and the [[Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles]]. In the past, there have also been Western Rite communities within [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. None of these are recognized by the canonical Orthodox Church \n\nWestern Rite parishes are found almost exclusively in countries with large [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (particularly [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]) populations. There are also numerous devotional societies and publishing ventures related to the Western Rite. While Western Rite Orthodoxy remains a contentious issue for some; however, the movement continues to grow in numbers and in acceptance.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Catapanate of italy.png|thumb|300px|right|Territorial extent of Byzantine (southern) Italy during the early 11th century. Modern city names (in English) are provided alongside the medieval Greek names.]]\nIn the times prior to theological disputes that arose between 9th and 11 century, [[Byzantine Rite]] churches of the East and [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Rite]] churches of the West were in full communion, confessing the same [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]], [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Christian faith. In the East, the Byzantine Rite was the predominant liturgical rite. In the West, the Latin Rite was the dominant rite. In the time of the final [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054, most of the Churches that remained in communion with four Eastern Patriarchates used the Byzantine Rite, though there were still regions where other liturgies, including the [[Roman Rite]], were used. One of such regions was Byzantine (southern) Italy.\n\nIn the time of the final split (1054) much of the southern Italy was still under Byzantine rule and was organized as the [[Catepanate of Italy]]. For centuries, church life in Byzantine regions of Italy was developing under dual influence of Latin and Byzantine traditions. During the 11th century, Latin rite churches in Byzantine Italy still did not use the interpolated Creed ([[Filioque]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and were in full communion with Eastern Orthodoxy. During the [[Byzantine\u2013Norman wars]], Byzantine Empire finally lost its last positions in the West. The [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]] was completed with the [[Siege of Bari|Conquest of Bari]] in 1071.\nOne of the main consequences of the political change was the establishment of the supremacy of the Church of Rome over the church life in former Byzantine Italy. The main theological challenge was resolved at the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.<ref name=\"Kidd2013\">{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=B.

Implementation of that decision soon marked the end of Latin rite Orthodoxy in southern Italy.\n\nAfter the 11th century, the Byzantine Rite was gradually becoming dominant in the Eastern Orthodox world, almost to the point of exclusion of any other liturgy. Traditions of old Western Orthodoxy were still regarded with high reverence by Eastern Orthodox theologians,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} but for centuries no organized attempt was made to preserve or revive the Latin branch of Orthodoxy. This changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when some Western Christians converted to Orthodoxy but retained some of their Western liturgical forms of worship.\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nDuring the 1840s, [[William Palmer (ecumenist)|William Palmer]], a Church of England priest, corresponded with [[Russian Orthodox Church]] / Metropolitan [[Philaret Drozdov]], of Moscow, and [[Aleksey Khomyakov]].\n\nFrom 1864, [[Julian Joseph Overbeck]], a former Roman Catholic priest, worked to establish a modern Orthodox Western Rite. Overbeck converted from Catholicism to [[Lutheranism]] and married. He then emigrated to England in 1863 to become professor of German at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], where he also undertook studies of the [[Church of England]] and Orthodoxy. In 1865 Overbeck was received as a layman into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (because he had [[clerical celibacy|married following his ordination]] as a Roman Catholic priest), by Father Eugene Poppoff, at the Russian Embassy in London.<ref name=\"Abramtsov1961\">{{cite thesis|location=Pittsburgh|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|last=Abramtsov|first=David F.|title=The Western Rite and the Eastern Church: Dr. J.

Initially, Philaret was hesitant about Overbeck's request, but did not rule out the idea entirely. Overbeck outlined his rationale for a Western Orthodox Church in his 1866 book ''Catholic Orthodoxy and Anglo-Catholicism'', a largely polemical work describing why the established Western churches should be rejected.<ref>Parry, Ken et al. (editors). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity''. Malden, Massachusetts: 1999. Blackwell Publishing, p. 364</ref> In 1867 Overbeck began to edit ''The Orthodox Catholic Review'', a periodical for the advancement of Western Orthodoxy.\n\nOverbeck convinced others about the feasibility of a Western Orthodox church and in 1869 submitted a petition containing 122 signatures, including many in the [[Oxford Movement]], to the Holy Synod asking for the creation of a Western liturgical rite within the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}.<ref>Parry, Ken et al., ''The Blackwell Dictionary'', p. 365.</ref>  A synodical commission investigated Overbeck's petition, in 1870 he stated his case before the commission in St. Petersburg. The commission approved the petition and he was instructed to present a revised Western liturgy for evaluation by the commission. He presented a revised Western liturgy in December. That liturgy was subsequently approved for use &ndash; specifically in the British Isles.<ref>''Sobranio mnenii i otzyvov Filareta, mitropolita moskovskago i kolomenskago, po uchebnym i tserkovno-gosudarstvennym voprosam'', ed. Archbishop Savva, Tome V, Part II (Moscow, 1888), 711&ndash;713.</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, Overbeck developed liturgies for administering other sacraments and for praying a [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]. Overbeck attempted to reach [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholics]] to his scheme since they had recently schismed from the Roman Catholic Church over [[First Vatican Council]]'s [[dogmatic definition]] of [[Papal infallibility]], though to little avail. During this time, he continued to criticize Roman Catholics and Anglicans as well as those Western converts to Orthodoxy who utilized the Byzantine Rite.\n\nBy 1876, Overbeck appealed to other Orthodox Churches for their recognition of his plan. In 1879 he was received in audience by the [[Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople]], who recognized the theoretical right of Western Christians to have a Western Orthodox Church. Three years later, Joachim III and the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate conditionally approved Overbeck's Western rite and Benedictine offices. However, Overbeck's efforts ultimately did not result in the establishment of a Western Orthodoxy. He was especially suspicious of the role which the Greeks in London (and the [[Church of Greece]] generally) played in the stagnation of his ambitions, directly blaming the Greek Church's protest against the plan in 1892.<ref name=\"Abramtsov1961\"/>{{rp|page=26}}  The ''Orthodox Catholic Review'' ended publication in 1885 and Overbeck died in 1905 without seeing a Western Orthodox Church. [[Georges Florovsky]] summed up Overbeck's experience in this way: \"it was not just a fantastic dream. The question raised by Overbeck was pertinent, even if his own answer to it was confusedly conceived. And probably the vision of Overbeck was greater than his personal interpretation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Florovsky|first=Georges|author-link=|date=1956|year=|title=Orthodox ecumenism in the Nineteenth Century|journal=St. Vladimir's Seminary Quarterly|volume=4|issue=3&ndash;4|location=|publisher=|page=32|doi=|jstor=|issn=|oclc=|url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nWhile Overbeck did not live to see his dream successful, the idea of a Western Orthodox church did not disappear. The early part of the twentieth century was characterized by a series of false starts. In 1911, [[Arnold Harris Matthew]] (a former Roman Catholic priest, later consecrated an Old Catholic bishop), entered into union with the Oriental Orthodox [[Patriarchate of Antioch]] under Metropolitan Gerasimos (Messarah) of Beirut and, in 1912, with the Eastern Orthodox [[Patriarch Photius of Alexandria|Pope Photios of Alexandria]].{{Disputed inline|text=Matthew [...] entered into union [...] under [...] Gerasimos (Messarah) [...] and [...] with [...] Photios of Alexandria|for=conflicts with multiple reliable sources|talk=Talk:Arnold Mathew#Mathew.27s reception into orthodoxy|date=June 2015}} Bishop Mathew's 1909 {{speculation inline|text=''Old Catholic Missal And Ritual'' may have been approved as a Western Rite liturgy by Pope Photios of Alexandria,|date=June 2015}} who wrote: \"...We have thanked God...that you omit the Filioque clause, and that you do not accept money for celebrating Masses.

Berkeley: Apocryphile Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, the first Western Rite Orthodox community in North America, an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] parish in Green Bay, Wisconsin, pastored by Fr. [[Ren\u00e9 Vilatte]], was received by Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky. {{Disputed inline|text=[...] 1890, the first Western Rite Orthodox community in North America, [...] pastored by [...] Vilatte, was received by Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky|Vilatte parish as first Western liturgical rite parish in America|reason=authenticity of document is questioned by reliable sources|date=June 2015}} However, Vilatte was soon ordained a bishop in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite Church]], an [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] not in communion with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Other small groups using the Western Rite have been received, but usually have either had little impact or have declared their independence soon after their reception. Western rite parishes were established in Poland in 1926 when a half-dozen congregations were received into Eastern Orthodoxy; however, the movement dwindled during World War II.<ref>Parry, Ken et al., ''The Blackwell Dictionary'', p. 515.</ref>\n\n====Orthodox Church of France====\n{{main article|Orthodox Church of France}}\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=Orthodox Church of France|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1936, the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} received a small group led by a former [[Liberal Catholic Church|Liberal Catholic]] bishop, Louis-Charles Winnaert (1880\u20131937), as ''{{lang|fr|l'\u00c9glise Orthodoxe Occidentale}}'' (EOO).<ref>Parry, Ken et al., ''The Blackwell Dictionary'', p. 514</ref> Winnaert was received as an archimandrite, took the religious name Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, and soon died. Winnaert's work was continued, with occasional conflict, by one of his priests, Eugraph Kovalevsky (1905\u20131970) and [[Lucien Chambault]], the latter of which oversaw a small Orthodox Benedictine community in Paris. After 1946, Kovalevsky began to recreate a [[Gallican rite]] based on the letters of [[Germain of Paris]], a sixth-century bishop of Paris, numerous early Western missals and sacramentaries, and some Byzantine modifications; his development was ''The divine liturgy of Saint Germanus of Paris''.<ref name=Luz>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Luz.

Eventually, Alexis was consecrated as an {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} bishop in 1960, continuing his Western Rite work under the auspices of the Moscow Patriarchate.<ref>W. Jardine Grisbrooke, \"Obituaries: Archbishop Alexis van der Mensbrugghe\" in ''Sobornost'' 4.2 (1981), 212&ndash;216.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, pressured by the {{clarify span|text=Russian Orthodox Church|explain=Does this mean Russian Orthodox Church or Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|date=June 2015}} to adopt the Eastern rite, the Western Orthodox Church went its own way, changing its name to the Orthodox Church of France. After several years of isolation, the Church was recognized as an autonomous Church by Metropolitan Anastasy Gribanovsky of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} and was in communion with {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} from 1959 to 1966.<ref name=Luz/> Archbishop [[John Maximovich]], ({{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}'s representative in Western Europe at the time), became the archpastor of the Church of France. At this time, Maximovich had the Church change its name to ''{{lang|fr|l'\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}'' (ECOF). Maximovich also consecrated Kovalevsky in 1964 as a bishop. Kovalevsky took the religious name Jean-Nectaire. Maximovich's death in 1966 was a serious blow to the Western Orthodox Christians in France.\n\nWhile the {{clarify span|text=Russian Orthodox Church|explain=Does this mean Russian Orthodox Church or Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|date=June 2015}}'s Western Rite mission withered and ended, {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} thrived; however, after Maximovich died, Kovalevsky was left without canonical protection until his death in 1970. In 1972, the Church found a new canonical superior in the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Gilles Bertrand-Hardy was then consecrated as bishop and took the religious name Germain of Saint-Denis. In 1993, after long conflict with the Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church about alleged canonical irregularities within {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}, the Romanian Orthodox Church withdrew its blessing of {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} and broke off communion.<ref name=Luz/> The Romanian Orthodox Church decided, which is contested by {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}, to depose Bertrand-Hardy from all sacerdotal functions. This decision (which was never accepted by {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}) is applied by the canonical dioceses of the AEOF (Assembl\u00e9e des Ev\u00eaques Orthodoxes de France). The sanction was confirmed and explained in 2001 by another document, \"Avis d'expertise canonique\" from the Secretary of the Romanian Synod (a document which the {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} considers to have no value). The Romanian Orthodox Church established a [[deanery#Catholic usage|deanery]] under Bertrand-Hardy's brother, Archpriest Gregoire Bertrand-Hardy, to minister to those parishes which chose to remain in communion with the Romanian Orthodox Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, scandalized by the revelation within {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} of Bertrand-Hardy's 1995 marriage and subsequent annulment, ten parishes separated from {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}, formed the ''{{lang|fr|Union des Associations Cultuelles Orthodoxes de Rite Occidental}}'' (UACORO), and began negotiations in 2004 with the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] to be canonically recognized, with the intention of the {{abbr|UACORO|Union des Associations Cultuelles Orthodoxes de Rite Occidental}} entering the Diocese of France and Western Europe. The laity and clergy of {{abbr|UACORO|Union des Associations Cultuelles Orthodoxes de Rite Occidental}} were received individually into the French diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2006.  These parishes are now predominantly Byzantine Rite, with the Gallican Liturgy served a few times a year.  Of the communities that left {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} the only ones which now retain the Western Rite are those that went on to form the [[Orthodox Church of the Gauls]].\n\n{{clarify span|text=Although the name of the Church legally remains the Orthodox Catholic Church of France, it usually goes by its previous name, the Orthodox Church of France.|explain=Which church \u2013 ECOF or UACORO?|date=June 2015}}\n\n==== North America ====\nSaint [[Tikhon of Moscow]]'s contribution to the Western Rite has been more enduring. While he was bishop of the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}'s diocese in America, some [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]] were interested in joining Orthodoxy while retaining Anglican liturgical practices. Tikhon, sent the 1892 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', enquired about the viability of Orthodox parishes composed of former Anglicans using Anglican liturgical practices. In 1904, the Holy Synod concluded that such parishes were possible and provided a list of doctrinal corrections to the ''Book of Common Prayer''{{'s}} text of the prayers and rites that were necessary to profess in Orthodox worship. The Holy Synod also concluded that detailed changes in the ''Book of Common Prayer'' and in Anglican liturgical practices, together with compilations of new prayers, and entire rites, can only be carried out on location in America and not from Moscow.<ref name=\"Frere1917\">{{Citation-attribution|{{cite book|author=[committee of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on Old Catholic and Anglican questions]|year=1917|editor-last=Frere|editor-first=Walter Howard|editor-link=|title=Russian observations upon the American prayer book|series=Alcuin Club tracts|volume=12|others=Translated by Wilfrid J.

In 1932, Bishop Aftimios consecrated an Episcopal priest, Ignatius Nichols, as auxiliary Bishop of Washington and assigned him to the Western Rite parishes. However, due to complaints from Episcopalians that the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] was the \"American\" Orthodox Church,<ref>Gary L. Ward, Bertil Persson, and Alan Bain. ''Independent Bishops: An International Directory'', xi. Apogee Books, 1990. {{ISBN|1-55888-307-X}}</ref> the American Orthodox Church that Aftimios and Nicholas were a part of became estranged from what would become {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} and the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (OCA). The subsequent marriages of both Aftimios and Nichols violated Orthodox [[canon law]], and left the church and its subsidiaries without canonical recognition.<ref>Gary L. Ward et al., ''Independent Bishops'', 295&ndash;96, 301&ndash;02.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Nichols founded the [[Society of St. Basil|Society of Clerks Secular of Saint Basil]] as a devotional society for clergy and laity dedicated to the celebration of the Western Rite. Nichols also consecrated Alexander Turner as a bishop in 1939. Turner pastored a small parish in Mount Vernon until Nichols' death in 1947, when he assumed leadership of the Society and concluded that there was no future for the Society of Saint Basil outside of canonical Orthodoxy. Turner described the situation the Society found itself in by saying:\n{{quote|It was ... during the tempestuous days following the Bolshevik Revolution that the Society had its inception as a missionary organ of the nascent federation of American Orthodox colonies under Russian suzerainty, though of local Syrian administration. With the collapse of that plan and the submission of the ethnic groups to the churches of their homelands, the Society was left in isolation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Society_of_Clerks_Secular_of_St._Basil |title=Society of Clerks Secular of St. Basil |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2019-05-20}}</ref>}}\n\nThrough Father Paul Schneirla, he began unofficial dialogue with Metropolitan Antony Bashir. Even before this, Turner had been promoting Western Rite Orthodoxy through his periodical ''Orthodoxy''. In 1961, the Society (consisting of three parishes) was received into the Syrian Antiochian Archdiocese on the basis of Metropolitan Antony's 1958 edict. Upon reception, Bishop Alexander Turner became a canonical priest of the Antiochian Orthodox Church, guiding the group as Vicar-General until his death in 1971, thereafter he was succeeded by Schneirla. However, after Turner's death, the sole surviving Basilian, William Francis Forbes, returned to the American Orthodox Catholic Church and was consecrated a bishop in October 1974.<ref>Gary L. Ward et al., ''Independent Bishops'', 143&ndash;44.</ref>\n\nBesides the original communities associated with the Society, a number of other parishes have been received into the Western Rite Vicariate of the Antiochian Archdiocese, particularly as elements within the Episcopal Church became dissatisfied with liturgical change and the ordination of women. The first Episcopal parish to be received into the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} was the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Detroit, Michigan.<ref>Benjamin J. Andersen, \"An Anglican Liturgy in the Orthodox Church: The Origins and Development of the Antiochian Orthodox Liturgy of Saint Tikhon\", Unpublished M.Div. Thesis, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, 2005, p. 7.</ref>  Additionally, several Western Rite missions have been founded within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}, some growing into full parish status. Furthermore, when parishes of the [[Evangelical Orthodox Church]] joined the Antiochian Archdiocese in 1987, a few parishes joined as Western Rite congregations. However, many of these former EOC congregations subsequently switched to the Byzantine Rite.\n\nAmong Old Calendarist groups, the sole jurisdiction utilizing a Western Rite is the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles, with approximately two dozen parishes. Due to their generally stricter stance, only older rites such as the Sarum are permitted.\n\n==== Elsewhere ====\nIn 1995, {{clarify span|text=the Church of Antioch also established a British Deanery to absorb converts from the Church of England,|explain=Which one, there are currently five different patriarchates|date=June 2015}} though none of these congregations is now Western Rite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|date=2012-04-23|title=Western Rite Orthodoxy|translator=Anthony Chadwick|website=sarumuse.wordpress.com|location=[s.l.]|publisher=Anthony Chadwick|url=https://sarumuse.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/western-rite-orthodoxy/|access-date=}} {{Self-published source|date=June 2016}} Translated from {{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|date=May 2002|title=Les tentatives de creation d'un rite orthodoxe occidental: esquisse historique|language=fr|website=religioscope.com|location=Fribourg|publisher=Institut Religioscope|url=http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_1.htm|access-date=2007-06-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817071515/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_1.htm|archivedate=2002-08-17|url-status=live}} {{webarchive |format=addlpages |date=August 2002|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020825011109/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_2.htm|title=Page 2|url2=https://web.archive.org/web/20020824233822/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_3.htm|date2=August 24, 2002|title2=Page 3|url3=https://web.archive.org/web/20020824234138/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_4.htm|date3=August 24, 2002|title3=Page 4|url4=https://web.archive.org/web/20020824234013/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_5.htm|date4=August 24, 2002|title4=Page 5|url5=https://web.archive.org/web/20020824234521/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_6.htm|date5=August 24, 2002|title5=Page 6|url6=https://web.archive.org/web/20020620194521/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_7.htm|date6=June 20, 2002|title6=Page 7|url7=https://web.archive.org/web/20020824235047/http://www.religioscope.com/info/articles/013_orthocci_8.htm|date7=August 24, 2002|title7=Page 8}}</ref>\n\nWestern Rite Orthodoxy, in Australia and New Zealand, emerged mostly from Anglican and Continuing Anglican communities.

The Synod of Bishops of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}, presided over by its First Hierarch, decreed that:<ref>{{cite web|author=Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia|date=2013-06-10|title=An extraordinary session of the Synod of Bishops is held|website=russianorthodoxchurch.ws|location=New York|publisher=Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia|publication-date=2013-07-12|url=http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/eng2013/20130712_ensynodmeeting.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718052210/http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/eng2013/20130712_ensynodmeeting.html|archivedate=2013-07-18|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n*{{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} would no longer ordain clergy for Western Rite parishes.\n*Bishop [[Jerome Shaw (bishop)|Jerome Shaw]] of Manhattan would be censured for unapproved ecclesial services and forcibly retired without the right to perform ordinations.\n*Some ordinations performed by Shaw would not be recognized, and those candidates would be thoroughly examined before regularization.\n*A commission would examine how to integrate Western Rite clergy and communities into the Russian Orthodox Church.\n*Western Rite clergy and communities need to adopt the order of divine services of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but may preserve \"certain particularities of the Western Rite\".\n*Adherence to the rules and traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church in particular is required.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia established a working commission to deal with the peculiarities that led to decision of July of 2013. Within the following year there was established a new leadership structure that eventually led to the establishment of a revitalized Western Rite Vicariate under the Omophorion of His Eminence Metropolitan Hilarion.  New Western Rite parishes and monasteries continue to be founded by ROCOR and priests, deacons and subdeacons within the Western Rite continue to be ordained from 2014 to the present, including in Sweden and the United States.<ref>http://orthochristian.com/100459.html; http://orthochristian.com/115386.html</ref><ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|author=Fr.

Many Western Rite Orthodox congregations celebrate a revised version of the Tridentine Mass under the name Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory.]]\n\nWestern Rite parishes do not all utilize the same liturgy, but often use a particular liturgy depending upon their individual affiliations prior to entering Orthodoxy. At present, there are nine different uses available to Western Rite parishes:\n\n* The '''Divine Liturgy of Saint Tikhon''' \u2013 This liturgy is currently used by approximately two-thirds of congregations in the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}. The Rite of St Tikhon was developed utilizing the 1928 American [[Book of Common Prayer#USA|Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[Anglican Missal]]. The Book of Common Prayer was altered by removing the ''[[filioque]]'' from the text of the Nicene Creed, adding prayers for the dead, the invocation of the saints, and strengthening the [[epiclesis]] within the Eucharistic prayer, and by adding the pre-communion prayers from the Byzantine Rite. It is utilized primarily by former Anglican and Episcopalian background parishes.\n* The '''Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory''' \u2013 Utilized by the remainder of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} as well as some communities in {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. As of 2016, The ROCOR Western Rite Communities use a Restored Gregorian Mass which is derived from texts that had been discovered and translated that are pre-Tridentine in origin and have no byzantine inclusions.\n* The '''Sarum Liturgy''' \u2013 A British use of the Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory, which retained many local Anglo-Saxon, Gallican, and Celtic elements. It is celebrated within {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} by the St Bride Hermitage and by the Hermitage of the Holy Cross. The text is based upon a nineteenth-century Pearson English translation of the [[Sarum Missal]], corrected of post-Schism insertions. An epiclesis from the Gothic Missal is included. St Hilarion Press and St Gregory's Press editions of Sarum services were blessed for canonical use, in September 2008 and December 2008, respectively.\n* The '''English Liturgy''' \u2013 The Russian adaptation of the 1549 English Book of Common Prayer according to the criteria set forth by the Holy Synod of Russia in 1907. This liturgy has been augmented with material from the Sarum Missal, Gothic Missal, York rite, and 1718 Scottish Non-Juror liturgy. An epiclesis from the Gothic Missal is included. This liturgy is not the same rite as the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon, and the two rites differ in many respects.<ref>{{cite web|title=The English Liturgy: according to the Western Rite, derived from the Sarum, 1549, 1718 etc., adapted using the rules authorised by the Holy Synod of Russia|website=orthodoxresurgence.com|url=http://www.orthodoxresurgence.com/petroc/english.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202405/http://www.orthodoxresurgence.com/petroc/english.htm|archivedate=2008-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* The '''Liturgy of Saint Germanus''' \u2013 Utilized by the French Orthodox Church, the Orthodox Church of the Gauls, and the Orthodox Church of France, as well as some parishes of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} and the Serbian and Romanian Patriarchates. The liturgy of St Germanus is a reconstructed version of the Gallican mass, supplemented with elements from the Byzantine, [[Celtic Rite|Celtic]] and [[Mozarabic Rite|Mozarabic]] rites.\n* The '''Liturgy of Saint John the Divine''' \u2013 Utilized by a monastery of the Moscow Patriarchate, and in publication within {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. It is a reconstructed version of the first millennium Celtic rite of the British Isles, from the [[Stowe Missal]] and other sources, and intended for modern use. The name is from the origin asserted by the Church in the British Isles before the Great Schism.\n* The '''Mozarabic Rite''' \u2013 The Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles as well as the Holy Synod of Milan permit use of the [[Mozarabic Rite]] and the Sarum use.\n* The '''Ambrosian Rite''' \u2013 The [[Ambrosian rite]] may be used in Western rite parishes of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. In 2018, a discovery was made of a very ancient missal which included a nearly complete Ambrosian Rite Liturgy that is in the process of being translated into English. \n* The '''Glastonbury Rite''' \u2013 The Glastonbury Rite was at one time used in the [[Celtic Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Catholic Apostolic Church|author-link=Catholic Apostolic Church|year=1979|title=The divine liturgy for the celebration of the Holy Eucharist according to the Glastonbury rite, commonly called the liturgy of Saint Joseph of Arimathea|edition=6th|location=London|publisher=Metropolitical Press|oclc=16489110|url=}}</ref>\n\nIn France, Bishop Alexis van der Mensbrugghe, of the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}, published a missal in 1962 which contained his restored Gallican rite and his restored pre-Celestinian Italic rite.<ref name=\"Mayer2014\">{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|author-link=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayer|year=2014|chapter={{thinsp}}'We are Westerners and must remain Westerners': Orthodoxy and Western rites in Western Europe|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9oRBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA273|editor-last=H\u00e4mmerli|editor-first=Maria|title=Orthodox identities in western Europe: migration, settlement, and innovation|location=Farnham [u.a.]|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409467540|pages=273\u2013286}}</ref>{{rp|page=276}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Mensbrugghe|first=Alexis van der|year=1962|title=Missel ou Livre de la synaxe liturgique: approuv\u00e9 et autoris\u00e9 pour les \u00e9glises orthodoxes de rit occidental relevant du Patriarcat de Moscou|language=fr|series=Contacts|volume=38\u201339/supplement|edition=revue and typ.|location=Paris|publisher=Contacts|oclc=716494134}}</ref><ref>Vincent Bourne, La Divine Contradiction.

As noted above, Tikhon's request to the Holy Synod concerned accepting Episcopal parishes into the Orthodox Church while permitting them to retain the liturgies of the Book of Common Prayer. While Saint Tikhon's request was specifically concerned with Anglicans converting, its recommendations came to be implemented for those parishes who did not have a specifically Anglican background. The two most important required changes included the removal of the ''filioque'' from the Nicene Creed and the addition of an epiclesis which specifically invokes the Holy Spirit and a petition for the Spirit to change the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nWhen the Antiochian Western Rite Edict was issued, it became necessary to determine what additions or corrections to western liturgies would need to be made to bring those rites into conformity with the 1904 Russian Synodal decree as well as the Ukase of 1936. To that end, the Antiochian Western Rite Commission was convened in 1958 composed of Fr Paul Schneirla, Stephen Upson, [[Alexander Schmemann]] and [[John Meyendorff]] for the purpose of determining \"the mode of reception of groups desiring to employ the Western Rite, and the character of the rites to be used, as well as the authorization of official liturgical texts.\"<ref>Benjamin Andersen, [http://occidentalis.blogspot.com/2004/09/western-rite-history-part-eight.html Western Rite History, Part 8], September 18, 2004. Last accessed March 16, 2007.</ref>  Meyendorff, Schmemann, and Schneirla were already familiar with the Western Rite both from having been in contact with members of the ECOF while teaching at Saint Sergius Theological Institute. Schmemann actively followed the [[Liturgical Movement]] in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Church and was an advocate for renewal of the Orthodox liturgy.<ref>Alexander Schmemann, \"Notes and Comments: The Western Rite\" in ''St. Vladimir's Seminary Quarterly'', 2.4 (1958), 37&ndash;38.</ref>\n\nIn January 1962, the official Western Rite Directory was issued, \"establishing liturgical usages and customs and discipline\", drawing on principles of the 1904 Moscow Synodal response to Saint Tikhon, the authorization of Western Rite offices by Metropolitan Gerassimos (Messarah) of Beirut, and the 1932 Russian Ukase of Metropolitan Sergius.<ref>[http://occidentalis.blogspot.com/2004/09/western-rite-history-part-eight.html Western Rite History, Part 8], September 18, 2004.

The SASB was produced by the Antiochian Archdiocese without the participation of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}.<ref name=\"Andersen2005\"/> ''The Orthodox Missal'' is an official publication of the  {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} and is the Vicariate's standard and approved text with the SASB authorized by the Archdiocese as an approved text.\n\nParishes within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} are permitted to use either the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon or that of Saint Gregory. While most parishes use the Tikhonite liturgy, several use the Gregorian liturgy on weekdays or on specific Sundays of the year. Presently, there is no breviary specifically designed for the Orthodox Western Rite, though priests of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} who celebrate the Liturgy of Saint Gregory are expected to pray as much of the ''[[Breviarium Monasticum]]'' as possible,<ref name=\"Anderson2003\">{{cite web|last=Andersen|first=Benjamin J.|date=May 2003|title=Sacrificium laudis: the Anglican Breviary and the Ancient Western Orthodox Divine Office|website=westernorthodox.com|location=Denver, Colorado|publisher=St. Mark's Parish|url=http://www.westernorthodox.com/stmark/lion/lion2003-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206010932/http://www.westernorthodox.com/stmark/lion/lion2003-05|archivedate=2012-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> in the ''[[Anglican Breviary]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson2003\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Episcopal Church|year=|orig-year=1955|editor-last=|editor-first=|title=The Anglican Breviary containing the Divine Office according to the general usages of the western church put into English in accordance with the Book of Common Prayer|location=Mount Sinai, New York|publisher=Frank Gavin Liturgical Foundation|oclc=173467899|url=}}</ref> The same hours, in English or Latin, are approved for Christ the Savior Monastery under the {{abbr|ROCOR|The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. However, priests who celebrate the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon pray a form of Morning Prayer and Evensong approved by the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}.\n\nAlso in common use within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}, though not officially approved, are ''St. Dunstans's Plainsong Psalter'',<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=St. Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter|website=andrewespress.com|location=|publisher=Andrewes Press|url=http://andrewespress.com/st-dunstans-plainsong-psalter-hardcover|access-date=}}</ref> ''The English Office Noted'',<ref>{{cite web|title=The Daily Office|website=stgregoryoc.org|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|publisher=St. Gregory the Great Orthodox Church|url=http://www.stgregoryoc.org/article/the-daily-office/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926063153/http://www.stgregoryoc.org/article/the-daily-office/|archivedate=2015-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref> and the ''St. Ambrose Hymnal''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order the St. Ambrose Hymnal|website=stgregoryoc.org|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|publisher=St. Gregory the Great Orthodox Church|url=http://www.stgregoryoc.org/article/ordering-the-hymnal/}}</ref> The ''St. Dunstans's Plainsong Psalter'' sets the Psalter and selected canticles to [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] and British Chant and includes orders for Morning Prayer, Evensong, and Compline. ''The English Office Noted'' includes Morning, Noonday and Evening Prayers, Compline and the Psalter set in modern notation. The ''St. Ambrose Hymnal'' provides musical settings of classic Western hymns as well as post-schism and modern hymns which are judged \"not to contradict the Orthodox faith.\"\n\nIn 2017, it was decided that the Restored Gregorian Liturgy and the English Liturgy were to be the main liturgies celebrated by ROCOR Western Rite parishes going forward. Parishes that were using the Ambrosian or other forms were approved on a case-by-case basis. Within {{abbr|ROCOR|The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}, on a limited basis, the ''Saint Colman Prayer Book'' has been authorized by Metropolitan [[Hilarion Kapral]] for use within the [[Diocese of Sydney, Australia and New Zealand]]. It has since received permission for limited use within other dioceses. The Book includes the Sarum rite, English rite, and Gregorian rite liturgies, together with a simplified version of the monastic hours. Most of the occasional services required by a Parish Priest through the course of the year are there, as well as the Rites of Holy Week and a Lectionary. {{citation needed span|text=In September 2008, Kapral blessed the Sarum Rite series published by St. Hilarion Press,|date=April 2016}} originally under the auspices of the Holy Synod of Milan and edited by Hieromonk Aidan Keller,<ref>E.g.: {{cite book|year=1998|translator-last=Keller|translator-first=Aidan|title=The old Sarum Rite missal: the liturgical heritage of old England, prepared for parish usage|series=Sarum Rite series|volume=6|location=Austin, Texas|publisher=St. Hilarion Press|isbn=9780923864156}}</ref> for liturgical use.{{discuss|section=St. Hilarion series name}} {{citation needed span|text=The Holy Synod of Milan also published approximately 30 volumes of texts of pre-schism services.|date=April 2016}} They contain complete forms for celebration of the Liturgy or Mass, the Divine Office, the Mysteries or Sacraments, and many other services, with full chant notation. In December 2008, the St. Gregory's Press edition was also blessed for actual usage; these contains full forms, with complete chant notation, for the celebration of the Liturgy or Mass and of the Divine Office, i.e., the Canonical Hours.\n\n== Church calendar ==\n\nAmong those Western Rite parishes that are within the Eastern Orthodox Church, some use the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] with the Byzantine [[Paschal cycle]], while others use other calendars.\n\nThe [[Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches]] uses the [[Gregorian Calendar]] to determine the dates of the holy days and [[Easter|Pascha]], while each member church has its own liturgical calendar. The Luxeuil Lectionary, ''Missale Gothicum'', ''Missale Gallicum'', and the Gallican adaptations of the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'' are the chief authorities for the Liturgical year of the Gallican Rite.\n\nThe Western Rite parishes of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles follow the [[Julian calendar]].\n\n== Vestments ==\n\nPriests of the Western Rite utilize standard Western [[vestment]]s as a part of their liturgy, whether celebrating one of the Western liturgies or (as far as Antiochians are concerned) when concelebrating a Byzantine liturgy, with some exceptions (See [[#Criticisms|Criticisms]] below). Antiochian Byzantine Rite Orthodox priests who concelebrate Antiochian Western Rite liturgies wear Byzantine style vestments and hierarchs wear Byzantine vestments when participating in Western liturgies.\n\nClergy using the Sarum or English liturgies use the vestments commonly known as ''Sarum'' but which were actually used throughout north-western Europe and the British Isles. These are typified by apparels' of the seasonal colour, added to the alb and amice for priest, deacon, subdeacon, clerk and servers in certain groups, although there is no evidence this was done before the thirteenth century.\n\n==Organizations==\nUnlike the 23 ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which are [[List of Catholic rites and churches|autonomous ritual churches]] with separate hierarchies and [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches|canon laws]], Western Rite Orthodox congregations of the Antiochian jurisdiction fall under the jurisdiction of their local Orthodox bishop. In North America, the Antiochian Church has established the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} and the Western Rite Commission to coordinate the activities of Western Rite congregations and to provide a single point of contact for persons and groups concerning Western Rite Orthodoxy. However, all the Western Rite congregations remain under the direct supervision of their normal diocesan bishop, with Bishop Basil (Essey) of Wichita being the \"hierarch of reference\" and advocate for Western Rite issues within the synod of Bishops. In the {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}, as of November 2009, all Western Rite Orthodox congregations and monastic houses fall under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan.\n\nThe [[Old Calendarists]] have two hierarchies which consider themselves Western jurisdictions and therefore have no liaison, citing the canonical responsibility of bishops to their local territories, opting to simply treat all parishes of Western and Eastern Rite equally. Of these, the larger Western Rite organization is the [[Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles]], with the presiding hierarch, Metropolitan John LoBue of New York and New Jersey, the only Orthodox bishop in North America who regularly employs Western usage in his monastery.\n\n===Publishing houses===\nThe official publishing arm of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} is St. Luke's Priory Press in Stanton, New Jersey. Among their publications are ''The Orthodox Missal'', the official service book of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}; ''The Orthodox Ritual'', the official source for the administration of all the sacraments in the vicariate; and the annual ''Ordo Kalendar''. They also publish several apologetic works concerning the Western Rite.\n\nLancelot Andrewes Press is the publishing arm of the Fellowship of Saint Dunstan and publishes material which is utilized by congregations and individuals in Western rites. The primary mission of Lancelot Andrewes Press is to publish material for the \"advancement of historic Christian orthodoxy, as expressed by the liturgical and devotional usages of traditional English Christianity.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.andrewespress.com/about.html |title=About Lancelot Andrews Press |access-date=2007-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403230103/http://www.andrewespress.com/about.html |archive-date=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Among their publications are the ''Monastic Diurnal'' and ''St. Dunstan's Plainsong Psalter''.\n\nWhile not official publishing houses, St Petroc Monastery, Christminster, and St. John Cassian Press have published copies of liturgies for use by {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} Western Rite congregations. St. John Cassian Press distributes former St. Hilarion Press publications (see \"Organizations\" above) blessed for {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} use, including ''Orthodox Prayers of Old England'' (omnibus service book), ''The Holy Psalter'' (core of the divine office), ''Old Sarum Rite Missal'', ''The Companion'' (epistle and gospel book), ''Chant Ordinarium'' (a kyriale), and ''Westminster Benedictional'' (a book of blessings), in all some 2,500 pages of approved texts, with chant. This body of work includes several apologetic works concerning Western rites and Orthodoxy in general.\n\nThe most voluminous texts of the Western Rite in English, however, have been produced by Old Calendarists: recently 10,000 pages of text of the Western monastic psalter in traditional English were placed online for free download and use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxengland.blogspot.com/2009/11/about.html |title=The Rites of Orthodox England |publisher=Orthodoxengland.blogspot.com |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Devotional societies===\n\nThere are also devotional societies within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}:\n*The Orthodox Christian Society of Our Lady of Walsingham \u2013 dedicated to encouragement of devotion to the [[Theotokos]], particularly under the title of Our Lady of Walsingham (and the preservation of the replica of the shrine of Walsingham).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westernorthodox.com/walsingham |title=Westernorthodox.com |access-date=2007-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627085301/http://www.westernorthodox.com/walsingham |archive-date=2007-06-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The Fellowship of Saint Dunstan \u2013 dedicated to historic Christian Orthodoxy particularly traditional English Christianity.\n\n===Parishes and missions===\nParishes and missions belonging to the Western Rite can be found in a number of Orthodox jurisdictions.

These congregations have been blessed to use western liturgical forms such as the ancient Gregorian Liturgy, the Sarum (*the Salisbury Local use of the Gregorian), the Mozarabic and Gallican Liturgies. Some congregations are also blessed to use what has become known simply as the English Liturgy, which is derived from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer; albeit, with some modification to the text to emphasize Orthodox theological teaching. The Western Rite that exists today has been heavily influenced by the  life and work of [[Julian Joseph Overbeck]].\n\nWestern Rite missions, parishes and monasteries exist within certain jurisdictions of the canonical [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], predominantly within the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|Russian]] and [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America|Antiochian]] jurisdictions in North America. Both operate under a structure known as a \"vicariate\" within their respective patriarchates. The Antiochian structure covers Western Rite parishes primarily in the United States while the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia has established parishes, missions and monasteries in the United Kingdom, Germany and Norway.\n\nIn addition, the Western Rite is practiced within religious communities outside the canonical Orthodox Church. The [[Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches|Communion of Western Orthodox Churches]] and the [[Orthodox Church of France]] are entirely Western Rite. Furthermore, there is a small number of Western Rite communities among the [[Old Calendarists]], such as the former Western Rite Exarchate of the [[Holy Synod of Milan]] and the [[Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles]]. In the past, there have also been Western Rite communities within [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. None of these are recognized by the canonical Orthodox Church \n\nWestern Rite parishes are found almost exclusively in countries with large [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (particularly [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]) populations. There are also numerous devotional societies and publishing ventures related to the Western Rite. While Western Rite Orthodoxy remains a contentious issue for some; however, the movement continues to grow in numbers and in acceptance.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Catapanate of italy.png|thumb|300px|right|Territorial extent of Byzantine (southern) Italy during the early 11th century. Modern city names (in English) are provided alongside the medieval Greek names.]]\nIn the times prior to theological disputes that arose between 9th and 11 century, [[Byzantine Rite]] churches of the East and [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Rite]] churches of the West were in full communion, confessing the same [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]], [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Christian faith. In the East, the Byzantine Rite was the predominant liturgical rite. In the West, the Latin Rite was the dominant rite. In the time of the final [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054, most of the Churches that remained in communion with four Eastern Patriarchates used the Byzantine Rite, though there were still regions where other liturgies, including the [[Roman Rite]], were used. One of such regions was Byzantine (southern) Italy.\n\nIn the time of the final split (1054) much of the southern Italy was still under Byzantine rule and was organized as the [[Catepanate of Italy]]. For centuries, church life in Byzantine regions of Italy was developing under dual influence of Latin and Byzantine traditions. During the 11th century, Latin rite churches in Byzantine Italy still did not use the interpolated Creed ([[Filioque]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} and were in full communion with Eastern Orthodoxy. During the [[Byzantine\u2013Norman wars]], Byzantine Empire finally lost its last positions in the West. The [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]] was completed with the [[Siege of Bari|Conquest of Bari]] in 1071.\nOne of the main consequences of the political change was the establishment of the supremacy of the Church of Rome over the church life in former Byzantine Italy. The main theological challenge was resolved at the [[Council of Bari]] in 1098.<ref name=\"Kidd2013\">{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=B. J.|title=Churches Of Eastern Christendom \u2013 From A.D. 451 to the Present Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tc5FAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA252|year=1927|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-21278-9|pages=252\u20133}}</ref> From that point, all churches in southern Italy were obligated to accept the [[Filioque]] clause into the Creed. Implementation of that decision soon marked the end of Latin rite Orthodoxy in southern Italy.\n\nAfter the 11th century, the Byzantine Rite was gradually becoming dominant in the Eastern Orthodox world, almost to the point of exclusion of any other liturgy. Traditions of old Western Orthodoxy were still regarded with high reverence by Eastern Orthodox theologians,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} but for centuries no organized attempt was made to preserve or revive the Latin branch of Orthodoxy. This changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when some Western Christians converted to Orthodoxy but retained some of their Western liturgical forms of worship.\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nDuring the 1840s, [[William Palmer (ecumenist)|William Palmer]], a Church of England priest, corresponded with [[Russian Orthodox Church]] / Metropolitan [[Philaret Drozdov]], of Moscow, and [[Aleksey Khomyakov]].\n\nFrom 1864, [[Julian Joseph Overbeck]], a former Roman Catholic priest, worked to establish a modern Orthodox Western Rite. Overbeck converted from Catholicism to [[Lutheranism]] and married. He then emigrated to England in 1863 to become professor of German at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], where he also undertook studies of the [[Church of England]] and Orthodoxy. In 1865 Overbeck was received as a layman into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (because he had [[clerical celibacy|married following his ordination]] as a Roman Catholic priest), by Father Eugene Poppoff, at the Russian Embassy in London.<ref name=\"Abramtsov1961\">{{cite thesis|location=Pittsburgh|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|last=Abramtsov|first=David F.|title=The Western Rite and the Eastern Church: Dr. J.

Initially, Philaret was hesitant about Overbeck's request, but did not rule out the idea entirely. Overbeck outlined his rationale for a Western Orthodox Church in his 1866 book ''Catholic Orthodoxy and Anglo-Catholicism'', a largely polemical work describing why the established Western churches should be rejected.<ref>Parry, Ken et al. (editors). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity''. Malden, Massachusetts: 1999. Blackwell Publishing, p. 364</ref> In 1867 Overbeck began to edit ''The Orthodox Catholic Review'', a periodical for the advancement of Western Orthodoxy.\n\nOverbeck convinced others about the feasibility of a Western Orthodox church and in 1869 submitted a petition containing 122 signatures, including many in the [[Oxford Movement]], to the Holy Synod asking for the creation of a Western liturgical rite within the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}.<ref>Parry, Ken et al., ''The Blackwell Dictionary'', p. 365.</ref>  A synodical commission investigated Overbeck's petition, in 1870 he stated his case before the commission in St. Petersburg. The commission approved the petition and he was instructed to present a revised Western liturgy for evaluation by the commission. He presented a revised Western liturgy in December. That liturgy was subsequently approved for use &ndash; specifically in the British Isles.<ref>''Sobranio mnenii i otzyvov Filareta, mitropolita moskovskago i kolomenskago, po uchebnym i tserkovno-gosudarstvennym voprosam'', ed. Archbishop Savva, Tome V, Part II (Moscow, 1888), 711&ndash;713.</ref>\n\nOver the next several years, Overbeck developed liturgies for administering other sacraments and for praying a [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]]. Overbeck attempted to reach [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholics]] to his scheme since they had recently schismed from the Roman Catholic Church over [[First Vatican Council]]'s [[dogmatic definition]] of [[Papal infallibility]], though to little avail. During this time, he continued to criticize Roman Catholics and Anglicans as well as those Western converts to Orthodoxy who utilized the Byzantine Rite.\n\nBy 1876, Overbeck appealed to other Orthodox Churches for their recognition of his plan. In 1879 he was received in audience by the [[Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople]], who recognized the theoretical right of Western Christians to have a Western Orthodox Church. Three years later, Joachim III and the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate conditionally approved Overbeck's Western rite and Benedictine offices. However, Overbeck's efforts ultimately did not result in the establishment of a Western Orthodoxy. He was especially suspicious of the role which the Greeks in London (and the [[Church of Greece]] generally) played in the stagnation of his ambitions, directly blaming the Greek Church's protest against the plan in 1892.<ref name=\"Abramtsov1961\"/>{{rp|page=26}}  The ''Orthodox Catholic Review'' ended publication in 1885 and Overbeck died in 1905 without seeing a Western Orthodox Church. [[Georges Florovsky]] summed up Overbeck's experience in this way: \"it was not just a fantastic dream. The question raised by Overbeck was pertinent, even if his own answer to it was confusedly conceived. And probably the vision of Overbeck was greater than his personal interpretation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Florovsky|first=Georges|author-link=|date=1956|year=|title=Orthodox ecumenism in the Nineteenth Century|journal=St. Vladimir's Seminary Quarterly|volume=4|issue=3&ndash;4|location=|publisher=|page=32|doi=|jstor=|issn=|oclc=|url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nWhile Overbeck did not live to see his dream successful, the idea of a Western Orthodox church did not disappear. The early part of the twentieth century was characterized by a series of false starts. In 1911, [[Arnold Harris Matthew]] (a former Roman Catholic priest, later consecrated an Old Catholic bishop), entered into union with the Oriental Orthodox [[Patriarchate of Antioch]] under Metropolitan Gerasimos (Messarah) of Beirut and, in 1912, with the Eastern Orthodox [[Patriarch Photius of Alexandria|Pope Photios of Alexandria]].{{Disputed inline|text=Matthew [...] entered into union [...] under [...] Gerasimos (Messarah) [...] and [...] with [...] Photios of Alexandria|for=conflicts with multiple reliable sources|talk=Talk:Arnold Mathew#Mathew.27s reception into orthodoxy|date=June 2015}} Bishop Mathew's 1909 {{speculation inline|text=''Old Catholic Missal And Ritual'' may have been approved as a Western Rite liturgy by Pope Photios of Alexandria,|date=June 2015}} who wrote: \"...We have thanked God...that you omit the Filioque clause, and that you do not accept money for celebrating Masses.

Berkeley: Apocryphile Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 1890, the first Western Rite Orthodox community in North America, an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] parish in Green Bay, Wisconsin, pastored by Fr. [[Ren\u00e9 Vilatte]], was received by Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky. {{Disputed inline|text=[...] 1890, the first Western Rite Orthodox community in North America, [...] pastored by [...] Vilatte, was received by Bishop Vladimir Sokolovsky|Vilatte parish as first Western liturgical rite parish in America|reason=authenticity of document is questioned by reliable sources|date=June 2015}} However, Vilatte was soon ordained a bishop in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite Church]], an [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] not in communion with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Other small groups using the Western Rite have been received, but usually have either had little impact or have declared their independence soon after their reception. Western rite parishes were established in Poland in 1926 when a half-dozen congregations were received into Eastern Orthodoxy; however, the movement dwindled during World War II.<ref>Parry, Ken et al., ''The Blackwell Dictionary'', p. 515.</ref>\n\n====Orthodox Church of France====\n{{main article|Orthodox Church of France}}\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=Orthodox Church of France|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1936, the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} received a small group led by a former [[Liberal Catholic Church|Liberal Catholic]] bishop, Louis-Charles Winnaert (1880\u20131937), as ''{{lang|fr|l'\u00c9glise Orthodoxe Occidentale}}'' (EOO).<ref>Parry, Ken et al., ''The Blackwell Dictionary'', p. 514</ref> Winnaert was received as an archimandrite, took the religious name Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, and soon died. Winnaert's work was continued, with occasional conflict, by one of his priests, Eugraph Kovalevsky (1905\u20131970) and [[Lucien Chambault]], the latter of which oversaw a small Orthodox Benedictine community in Paris. After 1946, Kovalevsky began to recreate a [[Gallican rite]] based on the letters of [[Germain of Paris]], a sixth-century bishop of Paris, numerous early Western missals and sacramentaries, and some Byzantine modifications; his development was ''The divine liturgy of Saint Germanus of Paris''.<ref name=Luz>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Luz.

Eventually, Alexis was consecrated as an {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}} bishop in 1960, continuing his Western Rite work under the auspices of the Moscow Patriarchate.<ref>W. Jardine Grisbrooke, \"Obituaries: Archbishop Alexis van der Mensbrugghe\" in ''Sobornost'' 4.2 (1981), 212&ndash;216.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, pressured by the {{clarify span|text=Russian Orthodox Church|explain=Does this mean Russian Orthodox Church or Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|date=June 2015}} to adopt the Eastern rite, the Western Orthodox Church went its own way, changing its name to the Orthodox Church of France. After several years of isolation, the Church was recognized as an autonomous Church by Metropolitan Anastasy Gribanovsky of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} and was in communion with {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} from 1959 to 1966.<ref name=Luz/> Archbishop [[John Maximovich]], ({{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}'s representative in Western Europe at the time), became the archpastor of the Church of France. At this time, Maximovich had the Church change its name to ''{{lang|fr|l'\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}'' (ECOF). Maximovich also consecrated Kovalevsky in 1964 as a bishop. Kovalevsky took the religious name Jean-Nectaire. Maximovich's death in 1966 was a serious blow to the Western Orthodox Christians in France.\n\nWhile the {{clarify span|text=Russian Orthodox Church|explain=Does this mean Russian Orthodox Church or Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|date=June 2015}}'s Western Rite mission withered and ended, {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} thrived; however, after Maximovich died, Kovalevsky was left without canonical protection until his death in 1970. In 1972, the Church found a new canonical superior in the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Gilles Bertrand-Hardy was then consecrated as bishop and took the religious name Germain of Saint-Denis. In 1993, after long conflict with the Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church about alleged canonical irregularities within {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}, the Romanian Orthodox Church withdrew its blessing of {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} and broke off communion.<ref name=Luz/> The Romanian Orthodox Church decided, which is contested by {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}, to depose Bertrand-Hardy from all sacerdotal functions. This decision (which was never accepted by {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}) is applied by the canonical dioceses of the AEOF (Assembl\u00e9e des Ev\u00eaques Orthodoxes de France). The sanction was confirmed and explained in 2001 by another document, \"Avis d'expertise canonique\" from the Secretary of the Romanian Synod (a document which the {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} considers to have no value). The Romanian Orthodox Church established a [[deanery#Catholic usage|deanery]] under Bertrand-Hardy's brother, Archpriest Gregoire Bertrand-Hardy, to minister to those parishes which chose to remain in communion with the Romanian Orthodox Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, scandalized by the revelation within {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} of Bertrand-Hardy's 1995 marriage and subsequent annulment, ten parishes separated from {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}}, formed the ''{{lang|fr|Union des Associations Cultuelles Orthodoxes de Rite Occidental}}'' (UACORO), and began negotiations in 2004 with the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] to be canonically recognized, with the intention of the {{abbr|UACORO|Union des Associations Cultuelles Orthodoxes de Rite Occidental}} entering the Diocese of France and Western Europe. The laity and clergy of {{abbr|UACORO|Union des Associations Cultuelles Orthodoxes de Rite Occidental}} were received individually into the French diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 2006.  These parishes are now predominantly Byzantine Rite, with the Gallican Liturgy served a few times a year.  Of the communities that left {{abbr|ECOF|\u00c9glise Orthodox Catholique de France}} the only ones which now retain the Western Rite are those that went on to form the [[Orthodox Church of the Gauls]].\n\n{{clarify span|text=Although the name of the Church legally remains the Orthodox Catholic Church of France, it usually goes by its previous name, the Orthodox Church of France.|explain=Which church \u2013 ECOF or UACORO?|date=June 2015}}\n\n==== North America ====\nSaint [[Tikhon of Moscow]]'s contribution to the Western Rite has been more enduring. While he was bishop of the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}'s diocese in America, some [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalians]] were interested in joining Orthodoxy while retaining Anglican liturgical practices. Tikhon, sent the 1892 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', enquired about the viability of Orthodox parishes composed of former Anglicans using Anglican liturgical practices. In 1904, the Holy Synod concluded that such parishes were possible and provided a list of doctrinal corrections to the ''Book of Common Prayer''{{'s}} text of the prayers and rites that were necessary to profess in Orthodox worship. The Holy Synod also concluded that detailed changes in the ''Book of Common Prayer'' and in Anglican liturgical practices, together with compilations of new prayers, and entire rites, can only be carried out on location in America and not from Moscow.<ref name=\"Frere1917\">{{Citation-attribution|{{cite book|author=[committee of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on Old Catholic and Anglican questions]|year=1917|editor-last=Frere|editor-first=Walter Howard|editor-link=|title=Russian observations upon the American prayer book|series=Alcuin Club tracts|volume=12|others=Translated by Wilfrid J.

In 1932, Bishop Aftimios consecrated an Episcopal priest, Ignatius Nichols, as auxiliary Bishop of Washington and assigned him to the Western Rite parishes. However, due to complaints from Episcopalians that the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] was the \"American\" Orthodox Church,<ref>Gary L. Ward, Bertil Persson, and Alan Bain. ''Independent Bishops: An International Directory'', xi. Apogee Books, 1990. {{ISBN|1-55888-307-X}}</ref> the American Orthodox Church that Aftimios and Nicholas were a part of became estranged from what would become {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} and the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (OCA). The subsequent marriages of both Aftimios and Nichols violated Orthodox [[canon law]], and left the church and its subsidiaries without canonical recognition.<ref>Gary L. Ward et al., ''Independent Bishops'', 295&ndash;96, 301&ndash;02.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Nichols founded the [[Society of St. Basil|Society of Clerks Secular of Saint Basil]] as a devotional society for clergy and laity dedicated to the celebration of the Western Rite. Nichols also consecrated Alexander Turner as a bishop in 1939. Turner pastored a small parish in Mount Vernon until Nichols' death in 1947, when he assumed leadership of the Society and concluded that there was no future for the Society of Saint Basil outside of canonical Orthodoxy. Turner described the situation the Society found itself in by saying:\n{{quote|It was ... during the tempestuous days following the Bolshevik Revolution that the Society had its inception as a missionary organ of the nascent federation of American Orthodox colonies under Russian suzerainty, though of local Syrian administration. With the collapse of that plan and the submission of the ethnic groups to the churches of their homelands, the Society was left in isolation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Society_of_Clerks_Secular_of_St._Basil |title=Society of Clerks Secular of St. Basil |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2019-05-20}}</ref>}}\n\nThrough Father Paul Schneirla, he began unofficial dialogue with Metropolitan Antony Bashir. Even before this, Turner had been promoting Western Rite Orthodoxy through his periodical ''Orthodoxy''. In 1961, the Society (consisting of three parishes) was received into the Syrian Antiochian Archdiocese on the basis of Metropolitan Antony's 1958 edict. Upon reception, Bishop Alexander Turner became a canonical priest of the Antiochian Orthodox Church, guiding the group as Vicar-General until his death in 1971, thereafter he was succeeded by Schneirla. However, after Turner's death, the sole surviving Basilian, William Francis Forbes, returned to the American Orthodox Catholic Church and was consecrated a bishop in October 1974.<ref>Gary L. Ward et al., ''Independent Bishops'', 143&ndash;44.</ref>\n\nBesides the original communities associated with the Society, a number of other parishes have been received into the Western Rite Vicariate of the Antiochian Archdiocese, particularly as elements within the Episcopal Church became dissatisfied with liturgical change and the ordination of women. The first Episcopal parish to be received into the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} was the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Detroit, Michigan.<ref>Benjamin J. Andersen, \"An Anglican Liturgy in the Orthodox Church: The Origins and Development of the Antiochian Orthodox Liturgy of Saint Tikhon\", Unpublished M.Div. Thesis, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, 2005, p. 7.</ref>  Additionally, several Western Rite missions have been founded within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}, some growing into full parish status. Furthermore, when parishes of the [[Evangelical Orthodox Church]] joined the Antiochian Archdiocese in 1987, a few parishes joined as Western Rite congregations. However, many of these former EOC congregations subsequently switched to the Byzantine Rite.\n\nAmong Old Calendarist groups, the sole jurisdiction utilizing a Western Rite is the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles, with approximately two dozen parishes.

Many Western Rite Orthodox congregations celebrate a revised version of the Tridentine Mass under the name Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory.]]\n\nWestern Rite parishes do not all utilize the same liturgy, but often use a particular liturgy depending upon their individual affiliations prior to entering Orthodoxy. At present, there are nine different uses available to Western Rite parishes:\n\n* The '''Divine Liturgy of Saint Tikhon''' \u2013 This liturgy is currently used by approximately two-thirds of congregations in the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}. The Rite of St Tikhon was developed utilizing the 1928 American [[Book of Common Prayer#USA|Book of Common Prayer]] and the [[Anglican Missal]]. The Book of Common Prayer was altered by removing the ''[[filioque]]'' from the text of the Nicene Creed, adding prayers for the dead, the invocation of the saints, and strengthening the [[epiclesis]] within the Eucharistic prayer, and by adding the pre-communion prayers from the Byzantine Rite. It is utilized primarily by former Anglican and Episcopalian background parishes.\n* The '''Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory''' \u2013 Utilized by the remainder of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} as well as some communities in {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. As of 2016, The ROCOR Western Rite Communities use a Restored Gregorian Mass which is derived from texts that had been discovered and translated that are pre-Tridentine in origin and have no byzantine inclusions.\n* The '''Sarum Liturgy''' \u2013 A British use of the Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory, which retained many local Anglo-Saxon, Gallican, and Celtic elements. It is celebrated within {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} by the St Bride Hermitage and by the Hermitage of the Holy Cross. The text is based upon a nineteenth-century Pearson English translation of the [[Sarum Missal]], corrected of post-Schism insertions. An epiclesis from the Gothic Missal is included. St Hilarion Press and St Gregory's Press editions of Sarum services were blessed for canonical use, in September 2008 and December 2008, respectively.\n* The '''English Liturgy''' \u2013 The Russian adaptation of the 1549 English Book of Common Prayer according to the criteria set forth by the Holy Synod of Russia in 1907. This liturgy has been augmented with material from the Sarum Missal, Gothic Missal, York rite, and 1718 Scottish Non-Juror liturgy. An epiclesis from the Gothic Missal is included. This liturgy is not the same rite as the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon, and the two rites differ in many respects.<ref>{{cite web|title=The English Liturgy: according to the Western Rite, derived from the Sarum, 1549, 1718 etc., adapted using the rules authorised by the Holy Synod of Russia|website=orthodoxresurgence.com|url=http://www.orthodoxresurgence.com/petroc/english.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724202405/http://www.orthodoxresurgence.com/petroc/english.htm|archivedate=2008-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* The '''Liturgy of Saint Germanus''' \u2013 Utilized by the French Orthodox Church, the Orthodox Church of the Gauls, and the Orthodox Church of France, as well as some parishes of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} and the Serbian and Romanian Patriarchates. The liturgy of St Germanus is a reconstructed version of the Gallican mass, supplemented with elements from the Byzantine, [[Celtic Rite|Celtic]] and [[Mozarabic Rite|Mozarabic]] rites.\n* The '''Liturgy of Saint John the Divine''' \u2013 Utilized by a monastery of the Moscow Patriarchate, and in publication within {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. It is a reconstructed version of the first millennium Celtic rite of the British Isles, from the [[Stowe Missal]] and other sources, and intended for modern use. The name is from the origin asserted by the Church in the British Isles before the Great Schism.\n* The '''Mozarabic Rite''' \u2013 The Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles as well as the Holy Synod of Milan permit use of the [[Mozarabic Rite]] and the Sarum use.\n* The '''Ambrosian Rite''' \u2013 The [[Ambrosian rite]] may be used in Western rite parishes of {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}. In 2018, a discovery was made of a very ancient missal which included a nearly complete Ambrosian Rite Liturgy that is in the process of being translated into English. \n* The '''Glastonbury Rite''' \u2013 The Glastonbury Rite was at one time used in the [[Celtic Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Catholic Apostolic Church|author-link=Catholic Apostolic Church|year=1979|title=The divine liturgy for the celebration of the Holy Eucharist according to the Glastonbury rite, commonly called the liturgy of Saint Joseph of Arimathea|edition=6th|location=London|publisher=Metropolitical Press|oclc=16489110|url=}}</ref>\n\nIn France, Bishop Alexis van der Mensbrugghe, of the {{abbr|ROC|Russian Orthodox Church}}, published a missal in 1962 which contained his restored Gallican rite and his restored pre-Celestinian Italic rite.<ref name=\"Mayer2014\">{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|author-link=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayer|year=2014|chapter={{thinsp}}'We are Westerners and must remain Westerners': Orthodoxy and Western rites in Western Europe|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9oRBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA273|editor-last=H\u00e4mmerli|editor-first=Maria|title=Orthodox identities in western Europe: migration, settlement, and innovation|location=Farnham [u.a.]|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409467540|pages=273\u2013286}}</ref>{{rp|page=276}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Mensbrugghe|first=Alexis van der|year=1962|title=Missel ou Livre de la synaxe liturgique: approuv\u00e9 et autoris\u00e9 pour les \u00e9glises orthodoxes de rit occidental relevant du Patriarcat de Moscou|language=fr|series=Contacts|volume=38\u201339/supplement|edition=revue and typ.|location=Paris|publisher=Contacts|oclc=716494134}}</ref><ref>Vincent Bourne, La Divine Contradiction.

As noted above, Tikhon's request to the Holy Synod concerned accepting Episcopal parishes into the Orthodox Church while permitting them to retain the liturgies of the Book of Common Prayer. While Saint Tikhon's request was specifically concerned with Anglicans converting, its recommendations came to be implemented for those parishes who did not have a specifically Anglican background. The two most important required changes included the removal of the ''filioque'' from the Nicene Creed and the addition of an epiclesis which specifically invokes the Holy Spirit and a petition for the Spirit to change the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nWhen the Antiochian Western Rite Edict was issued, it became necessary to determine what additions or corrections to western liturgies would need to be made to bring those rites into conformity with the 1904 Russian Synodal decree as well as the Ukase of 1936. To that end, the Antiochian Western Rite Commission was convened in 1958 composed of Fr Paul Schneirla, Stephen Upson, [[Alexander Schmemann]] and [[John Meyendorff]] for the purpose of determining \"the mode of reception of groups desiring to employ the Western Rite, and the character of the rites to be used, as well as the authorization of official liturgical texts.\"<ref>Benjamin Andersen, [http://occidentalis.blogspot.com/2004/09/western-rite-history-part-eight.html Western Rite History, Part 8], September 18, 2004. Last accessed March 16, 2007.</ref>  Meyendorff, Schmemann, and Schneirla were already familiar with the Western Rite both from having been in contact with members of the ECOF while teaching at Saint Sergius Theological Institute. Schmemann actively followed the [[Liturgical Movement]] in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Church and was an advocate for renewal of the Orthodox liturgy.<ref>Alexander Schmemann, \"Notes and Comments: The Western Rite\" in ''St. Vladimir's Seminary Quarterly'', 2.4 (1958), 37&ndash;38.</ref>\n\nIn January 1962, the official Western Rite Directory was issued, \"establishing liturgical usages and customs and discipline\", drawing on principles of the 1904 Moscow Synodal response to Saint Tikhon, the authorization of Western Rite offices by Metropolitan Gerassimos (Messarah) of Beirut, and the 1932 Russian Ukase of Metropolitan Sergius.<ref>[http://occidentalis.blogspot.com/2004/09/western-rite-history-part-eight.html Western Rite History, Part 8], September 18, 2004.

The SASB was produced by the Antiochian Archdiocese without the participation of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}.<ref name=\"Andersen2005\"/> ''The Orthodox Missal'' is an official publication of the  {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} and is the Vicariate's standard and approved text with the SASB authorized by the Archdiocese as an approved text.\n\nParishes within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} are permitted to use either the Liturgy of Saint Tikhon or that of Saint Gregory. While most parishes use the Tikhonite liturgy, several use the Gregorian liturgy on weekdays or on specific Sundays of the year. Presently, there is no breviary specifically designed for the Orthodox Western Rite, though priests of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} who celebrate the Liturgy of Saint Gregory are expected to pray as much of the ''[[Breviarium Monasticum]]'' as possible,<ref name=\"Anderson2003\">{{cite web|last=Andersen|first=Benjamin J.|date=May 2003|title=Sacrificium laudis: the Anglican Breviary and the Ancient Western Orthodox Divine Office|website=westernorthodox.com|location=Denver, Colorado|publisher=St. Mark's Parish|url=http://www.westernorthodox.com/stmark/lion/lion2003-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206010932/http://www.westernorthodox.com/stmark/lion/lion2003-05|archivedate=2012-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> in the ''[[Anglican Breviary]]''.<ref name=\"Anderson2003\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Episcopal Church|year=|orig-year=1955|editor-last=|editor-first=|title=The Anglican Breviary containing the Divine Office according to the general usages of the western church put into English in accordance with the Book of Common Prayer|location=Mount Sinai, New York|publisher=Frank Gavin Liturgical Foundation|oclc=173467899|url=}}</ref> The same hours, in English or Latin, are approved for Christ the Savior Monastery under the {{abbr|ROCOR|The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}.

''The English Office Noted'' includes Morning, Noonday and Evening Prayers, Compline and the Psalter set in modern notation. The ''St. Ambrose Hymnal'' provides musical settings of classic Western hymns as well as post-schism and modern hymns which are judged \"not to contradict the Orthodox faith.\"\n\nIn 2017, it was decided that the Restored Gregorian Liturgy and the English Liturgy were to be the main liturgies celebrated by ROCOR Western Rite parishes going forward. Parishes that were using the Ambrosian or other forms were approved on a case-by-case basis. Within {{abbr|ROCOR|The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}, on a limited basis, the ''Saint Colman Prayer Book'' has been authorized by Metropolitan [[Hilarion Kapral]] for use within the [[Diocese of Sydney, Australia and New Zealand]]. It has since received permission for limited use within other dioceses. The Book includes the Sarum rite, English rite, and Gregorian rite liturgies, together with a simplified version of the monastic hours. Most of the occasional services required by a Parish Priest through the course of the year are there, as well as the Rites of Holy Week and a Lectionary. {{citation needed span|text=In September 2008, Kapral blessed the Sarum Rite series published by St. Hilarion Press,|date=April 2016}} originally under the auspices of the Holy Synod of Milan and edited by Hieromonk Aidan Keller,<ref>E.g.: {{cite book|year=1998|translator-last=Keller|translator-first=Aidan|title=The old Sarum Rite missal: the liturgical heritage of old England, prepared for parish usage|series=Sarum Rite series|volume=6|location=Austin, Texas|publisher=St. Hilarion Press|isbn=9780923864156}}</ref> for liturgical use.{{discuss|section=St. Hilarion series name}} {{citation needed span|text=The Holy Synod of Milan also published approximately 30 volumes of texts of pre-schism services.|date=April 2016}} They contain complete forms for celebration of the Liturgy or Mass, the Divine Office, the Mysteries or Sacraments, and many other services, with full chant notation. In December 2008, the St. Gregory's Press edition was also blessed for actual usage; these contains full forms, with complete chant notation, for the celebration of the Liturgy or Mass and of the Divine Office, i.e., the Canonical Hours.\n\n== Church calendar ==\n\nAmong those Western Rite parishes that are within the Eastern Orthodox Church, some use the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] with the Byzantine [[Paschal cycle]], while others use other calendars.\n\nThe [[Communion of the Western Orthodox Churches]] uses the [[Gregorian Calendar]] to determine the dates of the holy days and [[Easter|Pascha]], while each member church has its own liturgical calendar. The Luxeuil Lectionary, ''Missale Gothicum'', ''Missale Gallicum'', and the Gallican adaptations of the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'' are the chief authorities for the Liturgical year of the Gallican Rite.\n\nThe Western Rite parishes of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles follow the [[Julian calendar]].\n\n== Vestments ==\n\nPriests of the Western Rite utilize standard Western [[vestment]]s as a part of their liturgy, whether celebrating one of the Western liturgies or (as far as Antiochians are concerned) when concelebrating a Byzantine liturgy, with some exceptions (See [[#Criticisms|Criticisms]] below). Antiochian Byzantine Rite Orthodox priests who concelebrate Antiochian Western Rite liturgies wear Byzantine style vestments and hierarchs wear Byzantine vestments when participating in Western liturgies.\n\nClergy using the Sarum or English liturgies use the vestments commonly known as ''Sarum'' but which were actually used throughout north-western Europe and the British Isles. These are typified by apparels' of the seasonal colour, added to the alb and amice for priest, deacon, subdeacon, clerk and servers in certain groups, although there is no evidence this was done before the thirteenth century.\n\n==Organizations==\nUnlike the 23 ''[[sui iuris]]'' [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which are [[List of Catholic rites and churches|autonomous ritual churches]] with separate hierarchies and [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches|canon laws]], Western Rite Orthodox congregations of the Antiochian jurisdiction fall under the jurisdiction of their local Orthodox bishop. In North America, the Antiochian Church has established the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} and the Western Rite Commission to coordinate the activities of Western Rite congregations and to provide a single point of contact for persons and groups concerning Western Rite Orthodoxy. However, all the Western Rite congregations remain under the direct supervision of their normal diocesan bishop, with Bishop Basil (Essey) of Wichita being the \"hierarch of reference\" and advocate for Western Rite issues within the synod of Bishops. In the {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}, as of November 2009, all Western Rite Orthodox congregations and monastic houses fall under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan.\n\nThe [[Old Calendarists]] have two hierarchies which consider themselves Western jurisdictions and therefore have no liaison, citing the canonical responsibility of bishops to their local territories, opting to simply treat all parishes of Western and Eastern Rite equally. Of these, the larger Western Rite organization is the [[Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles]], with the presiding hierarch, Metropolitan John LoBue of New York and New Jersey, the only Orthodox bishop in North America who regularly employs Western usage in his monastery.\n\n===Publishing houses===\nThe official publishing arm of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}} is St. Luke's Priory Press in Stanton, New Jersey. Among their publications are ''The Orthodox Missal'', the official service book of the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}; ''The Orthodox Ritual'', the official source for the administration of all the sacraments in the vicariate; and the annual ''Ordo Kalendar''. They also publish several apologetic works concerning the Western Rite.\n\nLancelot Andrewes Press is the publishing arm of the Fellowship of Saint Dunstan and publishes material which is utilized by congregations and individuals in Western rites.

St. John Cassian Press distributes former St. Hilarion Press publications (see \"Organizations\" above) blessed for {{abbr|ROCOR|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}} use, including ''Orthodox Prayers of Old England'' (omnibus service book), ''The Holy Psalter'' (core of the divine office), ''Old Sarum Rite Missal'', ''The Companion'' (epistle and gospel book), ''Chant Ordinarium'' (a kyriale), and ''Westminster Benedictional'' (a book of blessings), in all some 2,500 pages of approved texts, with chant. This body of work includes several apologetic works concerning Western rites and Orthodoxy in general.\n\nThe most voluminous texts of the Western Rite in English, however, have been produced by Old Calendarists: recently 10,000 pages of text of the Western monastic psalter in traditional English were placed online for free download and use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxengland.blogspot.com/2009/11/about.html |title=The Rites of Orthodox England |publisher=Orthodoxengland.blogspot.com |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Devotional societies===\n\nThere are also devotional societies within the {{abbr|AWRV|Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate}}:\n*The Orthodox Christian Society of Our Lady of Walsingham \u2013 dedicated to encouragement of devotion to the [[Theotokos]], particularly under the title of Our Lady of Walsingham (and the preservation of the replica of the shrine of Walsingham).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.westernorthodox.com/walsingham |title=Westernorthodox.com |access-date=2007-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627085301/http://www.westernorthodox.com/walsingham |archive-date=2007-06-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*The Fellowship of Saint Dunstan \u2013 dedicated to historic Christian Orthodoxy particularly traditional English Christianity.\n\n===Parishes and missions===\nParishes and missions belonging to the Western Rite can be found in a number of Orthodox jurisdictions.

Fewer steps were allowed than in the men's game. Players were not allowed to call a [[Mark (Australian rules football)|mark]] in the middle of the field. Instead, a mark was only allowed inside both 45 metre lines. This was intended to see more flow in the game.

The LGFA were in Singapore for their 2006 [[Ladies' Gaelic Football All Stars Awards|All Stars]] tour. There were a number of differences from the [[International Rules Series|men's game]]. Fewer steps were allowed than in the men's game. Players were not allowed to call a [[Mark (Australian rules football)|mark]] in the middle of the field. Instead, a mark was only allowed inside both 45 metre lines. This was intended to see more flow in the game. The scoring system and use of the round ball remained the same as in the men's game.<ref name=\"ladiesgaelic190306\">{{cite web|url=https://ladiesgaelic.ie/ladies-agree-international-rules-deal-with-afl/|title=Ladies Agree International Rules Deal with AFL|date=19 March 2006|publisher=ladiesgaelic.ie|accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"worldfootynews180306\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20060318235711849|title=International Rules series for the Ladies/Women|publisher=www.worldfootynews.com|date=18 March 2006|accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> The [[Tackle (Australian rules football)|Australian-style tackle]] was not allowed in the women's series.<ref name=\"irishexaminer311006\">{{cite web|url=https://amp.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/gaelic-girls-could-swing-it-for-aussies-17093.html|title=Gaelic girls could swing it for Aussies|publisher=irishexaminer.com|accessdate=8 November 2019|date=31 October 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"girlsplayfooty151116\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/20170316152023/http://girlsplayfooty.com/2016/11/reliving-the-one-and-only-womens-international-rules-series-10-years-on.html#selection-1217.1-1217.4|title=Reliving the one and only Women's International Rules series 10 years on|publisher=girlsplayfooty.com|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Series==\n===First test===\n{{footballbox collapsible\n| date= 31 October 2006\n| time    = 16:00\n| stadium = [[Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]\n| team1= [[Image:Flag of Ireland.svg|30px]] [[Ireland women's international rules football team|Ireland]]\n| goals1= '''6.26.16'''<br>Mary Sheridan (1-4-0; 18)<br>Geraldine Doherty (1-3-0; 15)<br>[[Cora Staunton]] (1-2-3; 15)<br>Sarah O'Connor (0-3-4; 13)<br>Dympna O'Brien (1-2-0; 12)<br>Brianne Leahy (1-1-0; 9)<br>Mairead Morrissey (1-1-0; 9)<br>Michaela Downey (0-2-1; 7)<br>Patricia Gleeson (0-1-3; 6)<br>Lorraine Muckian (0-2-0; 6)<br>[[Sin\u00e9ad Aherne]] (0-1-1; 4)<br>Bronagh Sheridan (0-1-1; 4)<br>Aoibheann Daly (0-1-0; 3)<br>Bronagh O'Donnell (0-1-0; 3)<br>[[Caroline O'Hanlon]] (0-1-0; 3)<br>Alma O'Donnell (0-0-1; 1)<br> A.M.

{"title_page": "Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company", "text_new": "[[Image:StEG.png|thumb|The StEG railway network]]\nThe '''Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company''' (German: ''k. k. privilegierte \u00f6sterreichische Staatseisenbahn-Gesellschaft''), from 1&nbsp;January 1883 the '''Privileged Austro-Hungarian State Railway Company''' (''privilegierte \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarische Staatseisenbahn-Gesellschaft'') was a private railway company in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Its title was abbreviated to '''State Railway Company''' (''Staats-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'') or '''StEG'''.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Priv. \u00f6sterr.-ungarische Staats-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft 1885.jpg|thumb|Bond of the Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company, issued 1. July 1885]]\n[[Image:Luzna_6.jpg|thumb|StEG tank wagon in the [[Lu\u017en\u00e1 u Rakovn\u00edka Railway Museum]]]]\nThe StEG was founded on 17 October 1854 primarily with French capital and on 1 January 1855 bought the [[Northern State Railway]] and the [[Austrian Southeastern Railway]] from the [[Austria]]n state, Hence the unusual name of the new company. By procuring the [[Eastern Railway (Austria)|Vienna\u2013Raab railway]] on 13 February 1855 and the [[Br\u00fcnn-Rossitz railway]] on 1 January 1879 and building new lines the StEG network within the Austrian part of the empire had grown by 1890 to around 1,350&nbsp;km; in addition there were 1,500&nbsp;km of railway in [[Hungary]].\n\nOn 15 October 1909 the StEG was nationalised and, with it became a part of the [[Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways]] or ''kkStB''. The routes on Hungarian territory had already been transferred to the [[M\u00c1V|Hungarian State Railway]] in 1891. That included the [[Bruck an der Leitha|Bruck]]\u2013[[Nickelsdorf]] and [[Marchegg]]\u2013border sections, that did not come into the [[Federal Railways of Austria]]'s (''BB\u00d6'') possession until 1920.\n\n== The StEG in present-day Austria ==\nIn the territories which form the current Austria, the StEG network covered a total of about 255&nbsp;km. Its start point was the state railway station in Vienna, later the [[Wien Ostbahnhof|Ostbahnhof]], which is today part of the [[Wien S\u00fcdbahnhof|S\u00fcdbahnhof]]. One main line headed south towards Budapest, passing through G\u00f6tzendorf to Bruck an der Leitha (1846), where until 1920 the border with Hungary lay, and on to the present-day border station of Nickelsdorf (1855). From 1884 the line branched in G\u00f6tzendorf  to Klein Schwechat on the one hand and Mannersdorf on the other.

Its title was abbreviated to '''State Railway Company''' (''Staats-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'') or '''StEG'''.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Priv. \u00f6sterr.-ungarische Staats-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft 1885.jpg|thumb|Bond of the Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company, issued 1. July 1885]]\n[[Image:Luzna_6.jpg|thumb|StEG tank wagon in the [[Lu\u017en\u00e1 u Rakovn\u00edka Railway Museum]]]]\nThe StEG was founded on 17 October 1854 primarily with French capital and on 1 January 1855 bought the [[Northern State Railway]] and the [[Austrian Southeastern Railway]] from the [[Austria]]n state, Hence the unusual name of the new company. By procuring the [[Eastern Railway (Austria)|Vienna\u2013Raab railway]] on 13 February 1855 and the [[Br\u00fcnn-Rossitz railway]] on 1 January 1879 and building new lines the StEG network within the Austrian part of the empire had grown by 1890 to around 1,350&nbsp;km; in addition there were 1,500&nbsp;km of railway in [[Hungary]].\n\nOn 15 October 1909 the StEG was nationalised and, with it became a part of the [[Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways]] or ''kkStB''. The routes on Hungarian territory had already been transferred to the [[M\u00c1V|Hungarian State Railway]] in 1891. That included the [[Bruck an der Leitha|Bruck]]\u2013[[Nickelsdorf]] and [[Marchegg]]\u2013border sections, that did not come into the [[Federal Railways of Austria]]'s (''BB\u00d6'') possession until 1920.\n\n== The StEG in present-day Austria ==\nIn the territories which form the current Austria, the StEG network covered a total of about 255&nbsp;km. Its start point was the state railway station in Vienna, later the [[Wien Ostbahnhof|Ostbahnhof]], which is today part of the [[Wien S\u00fcdbahnhof|S\u00fcdbahnhof]]. One main line headed south towards Budapest, passing through G\u00f6tzendorf to Bruck an der Leitha (1846), where until 1920 the border with Hungary lay, and on to the present-day border station of Nickelsdorf (1855). From 1884 the line branched in G\u00f6tzendorf  to Klein Schwechat on the one hand and Mannersdorf on the other. In 1886/87 a line was built from Bruck via Bad Deutsch Altenburg to Hainburg an der Donau.\n\nThe line from Vienna in the northern direction, opened in 1870, crossed the Danube and then divided at Stadlau to reach Marchegg  and Bratislava in the east; the other branch running via Mistelbach and Laa an der Thaya to Brno in the north. Not until 1888 was the branch from Enzersdorf bei Staatz to Poysdorf added.\nIn addition a short domestic line in Vienna from the Erdbergerl\u00e4nde to the horse racing track at Freudenau was built in 1886.\n\n==The routes==\n[[Image:Kratky, Frantisek - Adamov, rychlik (ca 1893).jpg|thumb|A train with a StEG I at [[Adamov (Blansko District)|Adamov]] on the Br\u00fcnn\u2013B\u00f6hm line.
