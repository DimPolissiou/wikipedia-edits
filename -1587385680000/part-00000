Ganesh Dutt of 9 Kumaon was awarded the Vir Chakra for his role in capturing Maharjke against Pakistani defenses.\n\n====Battle of Chhamb====\nTo preempt Pakistani attacks into India, a Kumaon battalion advanced into the Mandiala Heights in West Pakistan at the end of August 1965. Before they had the chance to set up any defenses, the Pakistan Army began a major offensive in the Chhamb sector during the early hours of 1 September, accompanied by massive artillery shelling targeting the Kumaon battalion's positions. There followed an armoured thrust by two Pakistani armoured divisions. Faced with enemy advancing from 3 sides, the battalion held off for a day and a half.

Col. (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on foot with full packs and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across [[Zoji La]], through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. To their credit they achieved this without suffering a serious casualty or a single fallout en route. They also became the first battalion to operate as a unit in the Nubra Valley and on the Siachen Glacier.\n\n19 Kumaon was the first battalion to hoist the Indian flag on the Saltoro Ridgeline (at Point 5705, an altitude of 18,717 feet) in the face of enemy fire, thus dominating Gyongla (18,655 feet) which was under enemy occupation. On 29 May 1984, 19 Kumaon lost 19 of its best soldiers, including one officer (2Lt. P.S. Poondir), who had volunteered to obey orders which they fully knew could take them to their certain death. During April and May 1984, 19 Kumaon was spread all through the area of Siachen with Capt. Roshan Lal Yadav at the Indira Col, Maj. Shashi Kant Mahajan and Maj. Darshan Lal Julka on the Central Glaciers (Gyongla, Zingrulma Lagongma, and Layogma Glaciers) and Maj. Rajender Singh Hooda in the Urdelop Glacier. 19 Kumaon was thus the first battalion ever to be spread out so much on the glacier (about 100&nbsp;km), which, perhaps, no other battalion has been subjected to ever since.<ref>Gorichen to Siachen, The Untold Saga of Hoisting the Tricolour on Saltoro By Brig DK Khanna, VSM -{{ISBN|978-93-86367-10-5}} Publisher Alpha Editions, Chapter 16, Page 116</ref>\n\nNk.

This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot.\n\n===Operation Pawan===\n{{Main|Operation Pawan}}\nKumaon units were deployed to [[Sri Lanka]] during [[Operation Pawan]]. A Kumaon battalion was the first Indian Army unit to land in [[Jaffna]] at the Palali airfield.<ref name=\"kumaon-op\"/> It successfully cleared the Kokuvil area, and moving to [[Mallakam]]. A number of LTTE militants were killed or captured.\n\nAnother battalion was deployed to search and destroy LTTE camps in the Kumurupiddi and Irrakandi areas of the [[Trincomalee]] Sector.

On 7 September, 9 Kumaon, under the command of Capt. V.K. Bogra, further advanced and captured Maharajke. Nk. Ganesh Dutt of 9 Kumaon was awarded the Vir Chakra for his role in capturing Maharjke against Pakistani defenses.\n\n====Battle of Chhamb====\nTo preempt Pakistani attacks into India, a Kumaon battalion advanced into the Mandiala Heights in West Pakistan at the end of August 1965. Before they had the chance to set up any defenses, the Pakistan Army began a major offensive in the Chhamb sector during the early hours of 1 September, accompanied by massive artillery shelling targeting the Kumaon battalion's positions. There followed an armoured thrust by two Pakistani armoured divisions. Faced with enemy advancing from 3 sides, the battalion held off for a day and a half. On 2 September, the battalion was ordered to withdraw after they had destroyed four Pakistani tanks. One Vir Chakra was awarded for the action.\n\n===Indo-Pakistan War of 1971===\n{{Main|Indo-Pakistan War of 1971}}\nKumaon battalions were deployed and fought on both the Eastern and the Western fronts during the war.<ref name=kumaon-1971>{{cite web|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTemp16P31C.aspx?MnId=xkFw09/aom0=&ParentID=1/O4fj0Mcdg=|title=Official Website of Indian Army|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Meghdoot===\n{{Main|Siachen Conflict}}\nThe Indian Army's initiative to hold the [[Siachen Glacier]] consisted of units of the Kumaon Regiment and the [[Ladakh Scouts]]. It was led by Maj. R.S. Sandhu, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for his leadership. Capt. Sanjay Kulkarni's unit was the first to land on [[Bilafond La]] and hoist the Indian tricolour. Kumaon units were instrumental in Indian success in capturing the glacier and repelling Pakistani attempts to retake it.<ref name=\"kumaon-op\">{{cite web|url=http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTemp3PLMMCRM6C.aspx?MnId=YSzhf1kWAbU=&ParentID=1/O4fj0Mcdg=|title=Official Website of Indian Army|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnticipating a Pakistani attack on the glacier at the start of the spring thaw in 1984, a full Kumaon battalion led by Lt. Col. (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on foot with full packs and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across [[Zoji La]], through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. To their credit they achieved this without suffering a serious casualty or a single fallout en route. They also became the first battalion to operate as a unit in the Nubra Valley and on the Siachen Glacier.\n\n19 Kumaon was the first battalion to hoist the Indian flag on the Saltoro Ridgeline (at Point 5705, an altitude of 18,717 feet) in the face of enemy fire, thus dominating Gyongla (18,655 feet) which was under enemy occupation. On 29 May 1984, 19 Kumaon lost 19 of its best soldiers, including one officer (2Lt. P.S. Poondir), who had volunteered to obey orders which they fully knew could take them to their certain death. During April and May 1984, 19 Kumaon was spread all through the area of Siachen with Capt. Roshan Lal Yadav at the Indira Col, Maj. Shashi Kant Mahajan and Maj. Darshan Lal Julka on the Central Glaciers (Gyongla, Zingrulma Lagongma, and Layogma Glaciers) and Maj. Rajender Singh Hooda in the Urdelop Glacier. 19 Kumaon was thus the first battalion ever to be spread out so much on the glacier (about 100&nbsp;km), which, perhaps, no other battalion has been subjected to ever since.<ref>Gorichen to Siachen, The Untold Saga of Hoisting the Tricolour on Saltoro By Brig DK Khanna, VSM -{{ISBN|978-93-86367-10-5}} Publisher Alpha Editions, Chapter 16, Page 116</ref>\n\nNk. (later Subedar/Honorary Captain) Ram Mehar Singh was awarded the [[Shaurya Chakra]] for his gallant role during the move. This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot.\n\n===Operation Pawan===\n{{Main|Operation Pawan}}\nKumaon units were deployed to [[Sri Lanka]] during [[Operation Pawan]]. A Kumaon battalion was the first Indian Army unit to land in [[Jaffna]] at the Palali airfield.<ref name=\"kumaon-op\"/> It successfully cleared the Kokuvil area, and moving to [[Mallakam]]. A number of LTTE militants were killed or captured.\n\nAnother battalion was deployed to search and destroy LTTE camps in the Kumurupiddi and Irrakandi areas of the [[Trincomalee]] Sector. Among the areas in which Kumaon units were deployed and operated included Kilividdi of Muttur Sector, [[Sampur, Trincomalee|Sampur]], Vellvutturai and [[Point Pedro]].\n\n===Kargil War===\n{{Main|Kargil War}}\nKumaon units were deployed during [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] to oust Pakistan Army regulars who had infiltrated the [[Kargil district|Kargil]] sector in [[Ladakh]] posing as insurgents. In difficult terrain and hostile weather conditions, they cleared and captured a number of altitude features. The regiment was honored with a number of gallantry awards for the operations.\n\n== Units ==\n[[File:The Indian Army Band performs the Indian national anthem during the opening ceremony of Yudh Abhyas 2015.jpg|thumb|Members of the Kumaon Regiment Pipes and Drums during the opening ceremony of Yudh Abhyas in 2015.]]\n*2nd Battalion (Berar)\n*3rd Battalion(kumaon rifles)\n*4th Battalion (The Fighting Fourth/ First PVC Paltan)\n*5th Battalion\n*6th Battalion\n*7th Battalion\n*8th Battalion\n*9th Battalion\n*11th Battalion\n*12th Battalion\n*13th Battalion (Rezang La Paltan/ Second PVC Paltan)\n*15th Battalion - (former Indore State Infantry, [[Imperial Service Troops]])\n*16th Battalion\n*17th Battalion ( Bhaduria Paltan)\n*18th Battalion\n*19th Battalion\n*20th Battalion\n*21st Battalion\n*111 Infantry Battalion [[Territorial Army (India)|Territorial Army]] (Kumaon) : Allahabad , Uttar Pradesh\n*130 Infantry Battalion Territorial Army (Kumaon) ECO : Pithoragarh , Uttarakhand \n*Kumaon Scouts\n\nOthers:\n*1st Battalion is now 3rd Battalion (Special Forces), [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n*10th Battalion is now the Kumaon Regimental Centre\n*14th Battalion (former Gwalior State Infantry, Imperial Service Troops) is now 5th Battalion, [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]]\n\nThe Kumaon Regiment also has affiliated to it three battalions of the [[Naga Regiment]], a [[Indian Navy|Navy]] ship and an [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]] Squadron.\n\n==Battle honours==\nThe list of battle and theatre honours of the Kumaon Regiment are as follows :<ref name=\"Sarbans\">{{cite book |title=Battle Honours of the Indian Army 1757 - 1971 |last=Singh |first=Sarbans |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Vision Books |location=New Delhi |isbn=8170941156 |pages=327 |url= }}</ref>\n;Pre-World War I {{refn|group=nb|[[Repugnant battle honours of the Indian Army|Repugnant battle honours]] are marked with an asterisk superscript ( like this <sup>*</sup> ).}}\nNagpore<sup>*</sup> \u2013 Maheidpoor<sup>*</sup> \u2013 Nowah<sup>*</sup> \u2013 Central India<sup>*</sup> \u2013 Burma 1885-87<sup>*</sup> \u2013 China 1900 \u2013 Afghanistan 1919.\n;The Great War\nNeuve Chapelle - France and Flanders 1914-15 \u2013 Suez Canal \u2013 Egypt 19l5-16 \u2013 Gaza \u2013 Jerusalem \u2013 Megiddo \u2013 Sharon \u2013 Nablus \u2013 Palestine 1917-18 \u2013 Tigris 1916 \u2013 Khan Baghdadi \u2013 Mesopotamia 1915-18 \u2013 Persia 1915-18 \u2013 Suvla \u2013 Landing at Suvla \u2013 Scimitar Hill \u2013 Gallipoli 1915 \u2013 Macedonia 1916-18 \u2013 E Africa 1914-16 \u2013 NW Frontier India 1914-15, 1916\u201317\n;The Second World War{{refn|group=nb|Theatre honours are shown in ''italics''.}}\nNorth Malaya \u2013 Slim River \u2013 ''Malaya 1941-42'' \u2013 Kangaw \u2013 Bishenpur \u2013 ''Burma 1942-45''\n;Post-independence\n;;Jammu and Kashmir\n:Srinagar \u2013 ''Jammu and Kashmir 1947-48''\n;;Chinese Aggression 1962\n:Rezang La \u2013 ''Ladakh 1962''\n;;Indo-Pak Conflict 1965\n:Sanjoi-Mirpur \u2013 ''Jammu and Kashmir 1965'' \u2013 ''Punjab 1965''\n;;Indo-Pak Conflict 1971\n:Bhaduria \u2013 Shamsher Nagar \u2013 ''East Pakistan 1971'' \u2013 ''Jammu and Kashmir 1971'' \u2013 ''Punjab 1971'' \u2013 Gadra City - ''Sindh 1971''\n\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Gallantry Awards==\nThe regiment has won 2 [[Param Vir Chakra]]s, 4 [[Ashoka Chakra Award|Ashoka Chakra]]s, 10 [[Maha Vir Chakra]]s, 6 [[Kirti Chakra]]s, 2 Uttam Yudh Seva Medals, 78 [[Vir Chakra]]s, 1 Vir Chakra & Bar, 23 [[Shaurya Chakra]]s, 1 Yudh Seva Medal, 127 [[Sena Medal]]s, 2 Sena Medals and Bar, 8 Param Vishisht Seva Medals, 24 Ati Vishisht Seva Medals, 1 PV, 2 PB, 1 PS, 1 AW and 36 Vishisht Seva Medals.\n\n;Param Vir Chakra\n\n<br />\n\n*Maj.

Historically, the first Klan used [[terrorism]] &ndash; both physical assault and murder &ndash; against politically active blacks and their allies in the South in the late 1860s, until it was suppressed around 1872.  All three movements have called for the \"purification\" of American society and all are considered \"[[Far-right politics|right-wing extremist]]\" organizations.<ref>Rory McVeigh, ''The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Right-Wing Movements and National Politics'' (2009).</ref><ref>Matthew N.

''The Ku Klux Klan and Related American Racialist and Antisemitic Organizations: A History and Analysis'', p. 100.

It sought to overthrow the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] state governments in the South, especially by using violence against [[African-American]] leaders. Each chapter was autonomous and highly secret as to membership and plans. Its numerous chapters across the South were suppressed around 1871, through [[Third Enforcement Act|federal law enforcement]]. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and [[Pointed hat|conical hats]], designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.<ref>See, e.g., Klanwatch Project (2011), illustrations, pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref>Elaine Frantz Parsons, \"Midnight Rangers: Costume and Performance in the Reconstruction-Era Ku Klux Klan\". ''Journal of American History'' 92.3 (2005): 811\u2013836.</ref>\n\nThe second Klan started small in Georgia in 1915. It grew after 1920  and flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, including urban areas of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]]. Taking inspiration from [[D. W. Griffith]]'s 1915 silent film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', which mythologized the founding of the first Klan, it employed marketing techniques and a [[Golden age of fraternalism|popular fraternal organization structure]]. Rooted in local Protestant communities, it sought to maintain white supremacy, often took a pro-[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] stance, and it opposed [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Jews]], while also stressing its opposition to the alleged political power of the Pope and the Catholic Church.  This second organization was funded by initiation fees and selling its members a standard white costume.  The chapters did not have dues. It used [[#Titles and vocabulary|K-words]] which were similar to those used by the first Klan, while adding [[cross burning]]s and mass parades to intimidate others. It rapidly declined in the later half of the 1920s.\n\nThe third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of localized and isolated groups that use the KKK name. They have focused on opposition to the [[civil rights movement]], often using violence and murder to suppress activists. It is classified as a hate group by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].<ref>Both the [http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/ Anti-Defamation League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003050902/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/ |date=October 3, 2012 }} and the [http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan/ Southern Poverty Law Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219174618/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan |date=February 19, 2010 }} include it in their lists of hate groups.

It seriously weakened the black political establishment through its use of assassinations and threats of violence; it drove some people out of politics.

The Klan used public violence against black people and their allies as intimidation. They burned houses and attacked and killed [[black people]], leaving their bodies on the roads.<ref>W. E. B.

There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters. Klan members used violence to settle old personal feuds and local grudges, as they worked to restore general white dominance in the disrupted postwar society. The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership:\n\n<blockquote>Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack vigilante groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime [[guerrilla]] bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, sadists, rapists, white workmen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.<ref>Parsons 2005, p. 816.</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{Wikisource|Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest}}\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] observed: \"In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic party]], the [[planter class]], and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society.

However, the second Klan, especially in the Southeast, was not an entirely non-violent organization. The most violent Klan was in Dallas, Texas. In April 1921, shortly after they began gaining popularity in the area, the Klan kidnapped Alex Johnson, a black man who had been accused of having sex with a white woman. They burned the words KKK into his forehead and gave him a severe beating by a riverbed. The police chief and district attorney refused to prosecute, explicitly and publicly stating they believed that Johnson deserved this treatment. Encouraged by the approval of this whipping, the Dallas KKK  whipped 68 people by the riverbed in 1922 alone. Although Johnson had been black, most of the Dallas KKK's whipping victims were white men who were accused of offenses against their wives such as adultery, wife beating, abandoning their wives, refusing to pay child support or gambling. Far from trying to hide its vigilante activity, the Dallas KKK loved to publicize it. The Dallas KKK often invited local newspaper reporters to attend their whippings so they could write a story about it in the next day's newspaper.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://oakcliff.advocatemag.com/2017/02/backstory-kkk-paraded-oak-cliff/ |title=Backstory: When the KKK paraded in Oak Cliff |access-date=March 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327091648/https://oakcliff.advocatemag.com/2017/02/backstory-kkk-paraded-oak-cliff/ |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all |date=2017-02-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=12678 |title=Good Deeds by Day, Dark Deeds by Night: The Ku Klux Klan in Fort Worth &#124; Hometown by Handlebar |access-date=March 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319144015/https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=12678 |archive-date=March 19, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.pd.031 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains |title=Ku Klux Klan |access-date=March 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213054605/http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.pd.031 |archive-date=February 13, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Alabama KKK was less chivalrous than the Dallas KKK was and whipped both white and black women who were accused of fornication or adultery.

[[Kelly J. Baker]] argues that Klansmen seriously embraced Protestantism as an essential component of their white supremacist, anti-Catholic, and paternalistic formulation of American democracy and national culture. Their cross was a religious symbol, and their ritual honored Bibles and local ministers. No nationally prominent religious leader said he was a Klan member.<ref>Kelly J. Baker (2011). ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915\u20131930''. University Press of Kansas.</ref>\n\nEconomists Fryer and Levitt argue that the rapid growth of the Klan in the 1920s was partly the result of an innovative [[multi-level marketing]] campaign. They also argue that the Klan leadership focused more intently on monetizing the organization during this period than fulfilling the political goals of the organization. Local leaders profited from expanding their membership.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=====Prohibition=====\nHistorians agree that the Klan's resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over Prohibition.<ref>Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'', pp. 119\u2013156.</ref> The historian Prendergast says that the KKK's \"support for [[Prohibition in the United States#National Prohibition|Prohibition]] represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation\".<ref>Prendergast 1987, pp. 25\u201352, 27.</ref> The Klan opposed bootleggers, sometimes with violence. In 1922, two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in [[Union County, Arkansas]]. Membership in the Klan and in other Prohibition groups overlapped, and they sometimes coordinated activities.<ref>Barr 1999, p. 370.</ref>\n\n====Urbanization====\n[[File:theendkkk.jpg|thumb|\"The End\" Referring to the end of Catholic influence in the US. ''[[Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty]]'' 1926]]\nA significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas, reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in the North, West, and the South. In Michigan, for instance, 40,000 members lived in [[Detroit]], where they made up more than half of the state's membership. Most Klansmen were lower- to middle-class whites who were trying to protect their jobs and housing from the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities: immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who were mostly Catholic or Jewish; and black and white migrants from the South. As new populations poured into cities, rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions. Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago, the Klan grew rapidly in the Midwest. The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Jackson 1992.</ref>\n\nIn the medium-size industrial city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in the 1920s, the Klan ascended to power quickly but declined as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church. There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as \"night-shirt knights\". Half of the members were [[Swedish Americans]], including some first-generation immigrants. The ethnic and religious conflicts among more recent immigrants contributed to the rise of the Klan in the city. Swedish Protestants were struggling against Irish Catholics, who had been entrenched longer, for political and ideological control of the city.<ref>Emily Parker (Fall 2009). {{\"'}}Night-Shirt Knights' in the City: The Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Worcester, Massachusetts\", ''New England Journal of History'', Vol. 66 Issue 1, pp. 62\u201378.</ref>\n\nIn some states, historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership. Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers. Detailed analysis from Indiana showed that the rural stereotype was false for that state:\n\n<blockquote>Indiana's Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society: they were not disproportionately urban or rural, nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class, middle class, or professional ranks. Klansmen were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], of course, but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. In reality, their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society, including those who did not belong to any church.<ref>Moore 1991, p 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long. Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group which they had wanted. Millions joined, and at its peak in the 1920s, the organization claimed numbers that amounted to 15% of the nation's eligible population. The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan's decline.\n\n====Costumes and the burning cross====\n[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Cross burning]] was introduced by [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]], the founder of the second Klan in 1915.]]\nThe distinctive white costume permitted large-scale public activities, especially parades and cross-burning ceremonies, while keeping the membership rolls a secret. Sales of the costumes provided the main financing for the national organization, while initiation fees funded local and state organizers.\n\nThe second Klan embraced the burning [[Latin cross]] as a dramatic display of symbolism, with a tone of intimidation.<ref name=\"Greenhouse\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/us/supreme-court-roundup-free-speech-or-hate-speech-court-weighs-cross-burning.html?pagewanted=all|title=Supreme Court Roundup; Free Speech or Hate Speech?

Its activities included participation in parades, cross lightings, lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women's Klan was active in promoting Prohibition, stressing liquor's negative impact on wives and children. Its efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and petitioning for the dismissal of Roman Catholic teachers. As a result of the Women's Klan's efforts, Texas would not hire Catholic teachers to work in its public schools. As sexual and financial scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization's popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.<ref>Kathleen M. Blee (2008).

In 1924, Klan members were elected to the city council in [[Anaheim, California]]. The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial-civic elite that was mostly [[German Americans|German American]]. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support Prohibition laws&nbsp;\u2013 the mayor had been a saloon keeper.\n\nLed by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1,200 members in [[Orange County, California]]. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many [[Catholic Germans]]. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired city employees who were known to be Catholic, and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce Prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.<ref name=\"Cocoltchos\" />\n\nThe opposition organized, bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local [[Klavern]] moved to Kansas.<ref name=\"Cocoltchos\">Christopher N. Cocoltchos (2004). \"The Invisible Empire and the Search for the Orderly Community: The Ku Klux Klan in Anaheim, California\". Shawn Lay, ed. ''The invisible empire in the West'', pp. 97\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn the South, Klan members were still Democratic, as it was essentially a one-party region for whites. Klan chapters were closely allied with Democratic police, sheriffs, and other functionaries of local government. Due to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of most African Americans and many poor whites around the start of the 20th century, the only political activity for whites took place within the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Alabama, Klan members advocated better public schools, effective [[Prohibition]] enforcement, expanded road construction, and other political measures to benefit lower-class white people. By 1925, the Klan was a political force in the state, as leaders such as [[J. Thomas Heflin]], [[David Bibb Graves]], and [[Hugo Black]] tried to build political power against the Black Belt wealthy [[Planter (American South)|planters]], who had long dominated the state.<ref>Feldman 1999.</ref> In 1926, with Klan support, [[Bibb Graves]] won the Alabama governor's office. He was a former Klan chapter head. He pushed for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972, and then under court order, the Klan was unable to break the planters' and rural areas' hold on legislative power.\n\nScholars and biographers have recently examined Hugo Black's Klan role. Ball finds regarding the KKK that Black \"sympathized with the group's economic, nativist, and anti-Catholic beliefs\".<ref>Howard Ball (1996). ''Hugo L. Black: cold steel warrior''. p. 16</ref> Newman says Black \"disliked the Catholic Church as an institution\" and gave over 100 anti-Catholic speeches in his 1926 election campaign to KKK meetings across Alabama.<ref>Roger K. Newman (1997). ''Hugo Black: A Biography''. pp 87, 104</ref> Black was elected US senator in 1926 as a Democrat. In 1937 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Black to the Supreme Court without knowing how active in the Klan he had been in the 1920s. He was confirmed by his fellow Senators before the full KKK connection was known; Justice Black said he left the Klan when he became a senator.<ref>Ball 1996, p. 96</ref>\n\n====Resistance and decline====\n[[File:D.

His conviction in 1925 for the murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a white schoolteacher, led to the decline of the Indiana Klan.]]\n\nMany groups and leaders, including prominent Protestant ministers such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] in Detroit, spoke out against the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] was formed in the early 20th century in response to attacks on [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]], including the lynching of [[Leo Frank]] in Atlanta, and the Klan's campaign to prohibit private schools (which was chiefly aimed at Catholic parochial schools). Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan's secrecy. After one civic group in Indiana began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid decline in the number of Klan members. The [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) launched public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly.<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\nSpecific events contributed to the Klan's decline as well. In Indiana, the scandal surrounding the 1925 murder trial of Grand Dragon [[D. C. Stephenson]] destroyed the image of the KKK as upholders of law and order.

They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.<ref>Moore 1991, p. 186</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Kkk1928.jpg|thumb|left|Ku Klux Klan members march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. in 1928]]\nIn Alabama, KKK [[vigilantes]] launched a wave of physical terror in 1927.

Sheriffs cracked down on activities. In the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]], the state voters overcame their initial opposition to the Catholic candidate [[Al Smith]], and voted the Democratic Party line as usual.\n\nAlthough in decline, a measure of the Klan's influence was still evident when it staged its march along [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1928. By 1930, Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6,000. Small independent units continued to be active in the industrial city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].\n\nKKK units were active through the 1930s in parts of Georgia, with a group of \"night riders\" in [[Atlanta]] enforcing their moral views by flogging people who violated them, whites as well as blacks. In March 1940, they were implicated in the beating murders of a young white couple taken from their car on a lovers lane, and flogged a white barber to death for drinking, both in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta. More than 20 others were \"brutally flogged\". As the police began to investigate, they found the records of the KKK had disappeared from their East Point office.

With access to dynamite and using the skills from their jobs in mining and steel, in the late 1940s some Klan members in Birmingham used bombings to destroy houses in order to intimidate upwardly mobile blacks who moved into middle-class neighborhoods. \"By mid-1949, there were so many charred house carcasses that the area [College Hills] was informally named Dynamite Hill.\"<ref name=Carry />\n\nActivism by these independent KKK groups in Birmingham increased as a reaction to the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.

Investigators in the 1920s used KKK publicity, court cases, expos\u00e9s by disgruntled Klansmen, newspaper reports, and speculation to write stories about what the Klan was doing. Almost all the major national newspapers and magazines were hostile to its activities. The historian Thomas R. Pegram says that published accounts exaggerated the official viewpoint of the Klan leadership, and repeated the interpretations of hostile newspapers and the Klan's enemies. There was almost no evidence in that time regarding the behavior or beliefs of individual Klansmen. According to Pegram, the resulting popular and scholarly interpretation of the Klan from the 1920s into the mid-20th century emphasized its Southern roots and the violent vigilante-style actions of the Klan in its efforts to turn back the clock of modernity. Scholars compared it to [[fascism]] in   Europe.<ref>David M. Chalmers, ''Hooded Americanism: The First Century of the Ku Klux Klan, 1865\u20131965'' (1965) p. 322</ref> Amann states that, \"Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism \u2013 chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism \u2013 yet their differences were fundamental. ...

In terms of the Klan, it developed evidence based on the characteristics, beliefs, and behavior of the typical membership, and downplayed accounts by elite sources.<ref>Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'', p. 225</ref><ref>Leonard J.

''Reviews in American History'' 24#4, pp. 555\u2013573.</ref> Historians discovered membership lists and the minutes of local meetings from KKK chapters scattered around the country. They discovered that the original interpretation was largely mistaken about the membership and activities of the Klan; the membership was not anti-modern, rural or rustic and consisted of fairly well educated middle-class joiners and community activists. Half the members lived in the fast-growing industrial cities of the period: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, were Klan strongholds during the 1920s.<ref>Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915\u20131930'' (1967)</ref>\n\nStudies developed as social history find that in general, the KKK membership in these cities was from the stable, successful middle classes, with few members drawn from the elite or the working classes. Pegram, reviewing the studies, concludes, \"the popular Klan of the 1920s, while diverse, was more of a civic exponent of white Protestant social values than a repressive hate group.\"<ref>Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aplUFE1XIcQC&pg=PA225 p.225] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414063733/http://books.google.com/books?id=aplUFE1XIcQC&pg=PA225 |date=April 14, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[Kelly J.

Baker]] (2017). ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915\u20131930''. p. 11</ref>\n\n=====Indiana and Alabama=====\nIn Indiana, traditional political historians focused on notorious leaders, especially [[D. C. Stephenson]], the Grand Dragon of the [[Indiana Klan]], whose conviction for 1925 kidnap, rape, and murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]] helped destroy the Ku Klux Klan movement nationwide. In his history of 1967, Kenneth Jackson already described the Klan of the 1920s as associated with cities and urbanization, with chapters often acting as a kind of fraternal organization to aid people coming from other areas.<ref>Jackson, ''The Klan in the Cities'', 1967</ref>\n\nSocial historian Leonard Moore titled his monograph ''Citizen Klansmen'' (1997) and contrasted the intolerant rhetoric of the group's leaders with the actions of most of the membership. The Klan was white Protestant, established Americans who were fearful of change: represented by new immigrants and black migrants to the North. They were highly suspicious of Catholics, Jews and blacks, who they believed subverted ideal Protestant moral standards. Violence was uncommon in most chapters. In Indiana, KKK members directed more threats and economic blacklisting primarily against fellow white Protestants for transgressions of community moral standards, such as adultery, [[Domestic violence|wife-beating]], [[gambling]] and heavy drinking. Up to one third of Indiana's Protestant men joined the order making it, Moore argued, \"a kind of interest group for average white Protestants who believed that their values should be dominant in their community and state.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard J.

They established the [[University of Notre Dame]], a major Catholic college near South Bend. In May 1924 when the KKK scheduled a regional meeting in the city, Notre Dame students blocked the Klansmen and stole some KKK regalia. The next day the Klansmen counterattacked.

They had no formal relationships with each other, or connection to the second KKK, except for the fact that they copied its terminology and costumes. Beginning in the 1950s, for instance, individual Klan groups in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], began to resist social change and blacks' efforts to improve their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods.  The white men worked in mining and steel industries, with access to these materials. There were so many bombings of blacks' homes in Birmingham by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city was nicknamed \"[[Bombingham]]\".<ref name=\"McWhorter\" />\n\nDuring the tenure of [[Bull Connor]] as police commissioner in Birmingham, Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity. When the [[Freedom Riders]] arrived in Birmingham in 1961, Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack.<ref name=\"McWhorter\" /> When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists, the federal government began to establish intervention and protection.\n\nIn states such as Alabama and [[Mississippi]], Klan members forged alliances with governors' administrations.<ref name=\"McWhorter\" /> In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of [[civil rights]] activists. In some cases they used physical violence, intimidation, and assassination directly against individuals. Continuing [[disfranchisement]] of blacks across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were [[all-white juries|all-white]] and demonstrably biased verdicts and sentences.\n\n[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Goodman]], [[James Chaney|Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner|Schwerner]] were three civil rights workers abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan.]]\nAccording to a report from the [[Southern Regional Council]] in [[Atlanta]], the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952.

It sought to overthrow the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] state governments in the South, especially by using violence against [[African-American]] leaders. Each chapter was autonomous and highly secret as to membership and plans. Its numerous chapters across the South were suppressed around 1871, through [[Third Enforcement Act|federal law enforcement]]. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and [[Pointed hat|conical hats]], designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.<ref>See, e.g., Klanwatch Project (2011), illustrations, pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref>Elaine Frantz Parsons, \"Midnight Rangers: Costume and Performance in the Reconstruction-Era Ku Klux Klan\".

It grew after 1920  and flourished nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, including urban areas of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]]. Taking inspiration from [[D. W. Griffith]]'s 1915 silent film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', which mythologized the founding of the first Klan, it employed marketing techniques and a [[Golden age of fraternalism|popular fraternal organization structure]]. Rooted in local Protestant communities, it sought to maintain white supremacy, often took a pro-[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] stance, and it opposed [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Jews]], while also stressing its opposition to the alleged political power of the Pope and the Catholic Church.  This second organization was funded by initiation fees and selling its members a standard white costume.  The chapters did not have dues. It used [[#Titles and vocabulary|K-words]] which were similar to those used by the first Klan, while adding [[cross burning]]s and mass parades to intimidate others. It rapidly declined in the later half of the 1920s.\n\nThe third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of localized and isolated groups that use the KKK name. They have focused on opposition to the [[civil rights movement]], often using violence and murder to suppress activists. It is classified as a hate group by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].<ref>Both the [http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/ Anti-Defamation League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003050902/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/kkk/ |date=October 3, 2012 }} and the [http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan/ Southern Poverty Law Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219174618/http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan |date=February 19, 2010 }} include it in their lists of hate groups.

It seriously weakened the black political establishment through its use of assassinations and threats of violence; it drove some people out of politics. On the other hand, it caused a sharp backlash, with passage of federal laws that historian [[Eric Foner]] says were a success in terms of \"restoring order, reinvigorating the morale of Southern Republicans, and enabling blacks to exercise their rights as citizens\".<ref>Foner, ''Reconstruction '' (1988) p 458</ref> Historian [[George C. Rable]] argues that the Klan was a political failure and therefore was discarded by the Democratic leaders of the South. He says:\n\n{{quote|the Klan declined in strength in part because of internal weaknesses; its lack of central organization and the failure of its leaders to control criminal elements and sadists.

For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] as governor in South Carolina.

While Simmons relied on documents from the original Klan and memories of some surviving elders, the revived Klan was based significantly on the wildly popular film, ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''. The earlier Klan had not worn the white costumes or burned crosses; these were aspects introduced in the film. When the film was shown in Atlanta in December of that year, Simmons and his new klansmen paraded to the theater in robes and pointed hoods\u2014many on robed horses\u2014just like in the movie.

The national headquarters made its profit through a monopoly of costume sales, while the organizers were paid through initiation fees. It grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity. Reflecting the social tensions pitting urban versus rural America, it spread to every state and was prominent in many cities. The second KKK preached \"One Hundred Percent Americanism\" and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].

In 1866, Mississippi Governor [[William L. Sharkey]] reported that disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan used public violence against black people and their allies as intimidation. They burned houses and attacked and killed [[black people]], leaving their bodies on the roads.<ref>W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America: 1860\u20131880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, The Free Press, 1998, p. 671\u2013675.</ref>\n\n[[File:Anti-kkk-cartoon.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon depicting the KKK and the Democratic Party as continuations of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]]]\nAt an 1867 meeting in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Klan members gathered to try to create a hierarchical organization with local chapters eventually reporting to a national headquarters.

Local chapters and bands were highly independent.\n\n[[File:NathanBedfordForrest.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]]]\nFormer Confederate Brigadier General [[George Gordon (Civil War General)|George Gordon]] developed the ''Prescript'', which espoused white supremacist belief.

There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters. Klan members used violence to settle old personal feuds and local grudges, as they worked to restore general white dominance in the disrupted postwar society. The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership:\n\n<blockquote>Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of antiblack vigilante groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime [[guerrilla]] bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, sadists, rapists, white workmen fearful of black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], was that they called themselves, or were called, Klansmen.<ref>Parsons 2005, p. 816.</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{Wikisource|Interview with Nathan Bedford Forrest}}\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] observed: \"In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic party]], the [[planter class]], and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican party's infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life.<ref name=\"Foner425\">Foner 1988, p. 425\u2013426.</ref> To that end they worked to curb the education, economic advancement, [[voting rights]], and [[right to keep and bear arms]] of blacks.<ref name=\"Foner425\" /> The Klan soon spread into nearly every Southern state, launching a reign of terror against Republican leaders both black and white.

When they killed black political leaders, they also took heads of families, along with the leaders of churches and community groups, because these people had many roles in society. Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of blacks.\n\n\"Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites.\" Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside.

Although [[St. Landry Parish]] had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods.

A publicist claimed that Wilson said, \"It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.\" Wilson strongly disliked the film and felt he had been tricked by Dixon.

However, the second Klan, especially in the Southeast, was not an entirely non-violent organization. The most violent Klan was in Dallas, Texas. In April 1921, shortly after they began gaining popularity in the area, the Klan kidnapped Alex Johnson, a black man who had been accused of having sex with a white woman. They burned the words KKK into his forehead and gave him a severe beating by a riverbed. The police chief and district attorney refused to prosecute, explicitly and publicly stating they believed that Johnson deserved this treatment. Encouraged by the approval of this whipping, the Dallas KKK  whipped 68 people by the riverbed in 1922 alone. Although Johnson had been black, most of the Dallas KKK's whipping victims were white men who were accused of offenses against their wives such as adultery, wife beating, abandoning their wives, refusing to pay child support or gambling. Far from trying to hide its vigilante activity, the Dallas KKK loved to publicize it. The Dallas KKK often invited local newspaper reporters to attend their whippings so they could write a story about it in the next day's newspaper.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://oakcliff.advocatemag.com/2017/02/backstory-kkk-paraded-oak-cliff/ |title=Backstory: When the KKK paraded in Oak Cliff |access-date=March 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327091648/https://oakcliff.advocatemag.com/2017/02/backstory-kkk-paraded-oak-cliff/ |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all |date=2017-02-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=12678 |title=Good Deeds by Day, Dark Deeds by Night: The Ku Klux Klan in Fort Worth &#124; Hometown by Handlebar |access-date=March 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319144015/https://hometownbyhandlebar.com/?p=12678 |archive-date=March 19, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.pd.031 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains |title=Ku Klux Klan |access-date=March 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213054605/http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.pd.031 |archive-date=February 13, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Alabama KKK was less chivalrous than the Dallas KKK was and whipped both white and black women who were accused of fornication or adultery.

[[Kelly J. Baker]] argues that Klansmen seriously embraced Protestantism as an essential component of their white supremacist, anti-Catholic, and paternalistic formulation of American democracy and national culture. Their cross was a religious symbol, and their ritual honored Bibles and local ministers. No nationally prominent religious leader said he was a Klan member.<ref>Kelly J. Baker (2011). ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915\u20131930''. University Press of Kansas.</ref>\n\nEconomists Fryer and Levitt argue that the rapid growth of the Klan in the 1920s was partly the result of an innovative [[multi-level marketing]] campaign. They also argue that the Klan leadership focused more intently on monetizing the organization during this period than fulfilling the political goals of the organization. Local leaders profited from expanding their membership.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=====Prohibition=====\nHistorians agree that the Klan's resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over Prohibition.<ref>Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'', pp. 119\u2013156.</ref> The historian Prendergast says that the KKK's \"support for [[Prohibition in the United States#National Prohibition|Prohibition]] represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation\".<ref>Prendergast 1987, pp. 25\u201352, 27.</ref> The Klan opposed bootleggers, sometimes with violence. In 1922, two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in [[Union County, Arkansas]]. Membership in the Klan and in other Prohibition groups overlapped, and they sometimes coordinated activities.<ref>Barr 1999, p. 370.</ref>\n\n====Urbanization====\n[[File:theendkkk.jpg|thumb|\"The End\" Referring to the end of Catholic influence in the US. ''[[Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty]]'' 1926]]\nA significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas, reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in the North, West, and the South. In Michigan, for instance, 40,000 members lived in [[Detroit]], where they made up more than half of the state's membership. Most Klansmen were lower- to middle-class whites who were trying to protect their jobs and housing from the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities: immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who were mostly Catholic or Jewish; and black and white migrants from the South. As new populations poured into cities, rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions. Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago, the Klan grew rapidly in the Midwest. The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Jackson 1992.</ref>\n\nIn the medium-size industrial city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in the 1920s, the Klan ascended to power quickly but declined as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church. There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as \"night-shirt knights\". Half of the members were [[Swedish Americans]], including some first-generation immigrants. The ethnic and religious conflicts among more recent immigrants contributed to the rise of the Klan in the city. Swedish Protestants were struggling against Irish Catholics, who had been entrenched longer, for political and ideological control of the city.<ref>Emily Parker (Fall 2009). {{\"'}}Night-Shirt Knights' in the City: The Ku Klux Klan in 1920s Worcester, Massachusetts\", ''New England Journal of History'', Vol. 66 Issue 1, pp. 62\u201378.</ref>\n\nIn some states, historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership. Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers. Detailed analysis from Indiana showed that the rural stereotype was false for that state:\n\n<blockquote>Indiana's Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society: they were not disproportionately urban or rural, nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class, middle class, or professional ranks. Klansmen were [[Protestantism|Protestants]], of course, but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. In reality, their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society, including those who did not belong to any church.<ref>Moore 1991, p 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long. Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group which they had wanted. Millions joined, and at its peak in the 1920s, the organization claimed numbers that amounted to 15% of the nation's eligible population. The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan's decline.\n\n====Costumes and the burning cross====\n[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|[[Cross burning]] was introduced by [[William Joseph Simmons|William J.

Its activities included participation in parades, cross lightings, lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women's Klan was active in promoting Prohibition, stressing liquor's negative impact on wives and children. Its efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and petitioning for the dismissal of Roman Catholic teachers. As a result of the Women's Klan's efforts, Texas would not hire Catholic teachers to work in its public schools. As sexual and financial scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization's popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.<ref>Kathleen M. Blee (2008).

In 1924, Klan members were elected to the city council in [[Anaheim, California]]. The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial-civic elite that was mostly [[German Americans|German American]]. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support Prohibition laws&nbsp;\u2013 the mayor had been a saloon keeper.\n\nLed by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1,200 members in [[Orange County, California]]. The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many [[Catholic Germans]]. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired city employees who were known to be Catholic, and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce Prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer.<ref name=\"Cocoltchos\" />\n\nThe opposition organized, bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local [[Klavern]] moved to Kansas.<ref name=\"Cocoltchos\">Christopher N. Cocoltchos (2004). \"The Invisible Empire and the Search for the Orderly Community: The Ku Klux Klan in Anaheim, California\". Shawn Lay, ed. ''The invisible empire in the West'', pp. 97\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn the South, Klan members were still Democratic, as it was essentially a one-party region for whites. Klan chapters were closely allied with Democratic police, sheriffs, and other functionaries of local government. Due to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of most African Americans and many poor whites around the start of the 20th century, the only political activity for whites took place within the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Alabama, Klan members advocated better public schools, effective [[Prohibition]] enforcement, expanded road construction, and other political measures to benefit lower-class white people. By 1925, the Klan was a political force in the state, as leaders such as [[J. Thomas Heflin]], [[David Bibb Graves]], and [[Hugo Black]] tried to build political power against the Black Belt wealthy [[Planter (American South)|planters]], who had long dominated the state.<ref>Feldman 1999.</ref> In 1926, with Klan support, [[Bibb Graves]] won the Alabama governor's office. He was a former Klan chapter head. He pushed for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972, and then under court order, the Klan was unable to break the planters' and rural areas' hold on legislative power.\n\nScholars and biographers have recently examined Hugo Black's Klan role. Ball finds regarding the KKK that Black \"sympathized with the group's economic, nativist, and anti-Catholic beliefs\".<ref>Howard Ball (1996). ''Hugo L. Black: cold steel warrior''. p. 16</ref> Newman says Black \"disliked the Catholic Church as an institution\" and gave over 100 anti-Catholic speeches in his 1926 election campaign to KKK meetings across Alabama.<ref>Roger K. Newman (1997). ''Hugo Black: A Biography''. pp 87, 104</ref> Black was elected US senator in 1926 as a Democrat. In 1937 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appointed Black to the Supreme Court without knowing how active in the Klan he had been in the 1920s. He was confirmed by his fellow Senators before the full KKK connection was known; Justice Black said he left the Klan when he became a senator.<ref>Ball 1996, p. 96</ref>\n\n====Resistance and decline====\n[[File:D. C. Stephenson Grand Dragon of the Klu Klux Klan in Indiana, c 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|[[D. C. Stephenson]], Grand Dragon of the [[Indiana Klan]]. His conviction in 1925 for the murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]], a white schoolteacher, led to the decline of the Indiana Klan.]]\n\nMany groups and leaders, including prominent Protestant ministers such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] in Detroit, spoke out against the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] was formed in the early 20th century in response to attacks on [[American Jews|Jewish Americans]], including the lynching of [[Leo Frank]] in Atlanta, and the Klan's campaign to prohibit private schools (which was chiefly aimed at Catholic parochial schools). Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan's secrecy. After one civic group in Indiana began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid decline in the number of Klan members. The [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) launched public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly.<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\nSpecific events contributed to the Klan's decline as well. In Indiana, the scandal surrounding the 1925 murder trial of Grand Dragon [[D. C. Stephenson]] destroyed the image of the KKK as upholders of law and order. By 1926 the Klan was \"crippled and discredited\".<ref name=\"Library\">{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm|title=Ku Klux Klan in Indiana|publisher=Indiana State Library|date=November 2000|access-date=September 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918163319/http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm|archive-date=September 18, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> D.

They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.<ref>Moore 1991, p. 186</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Kkk1928.jpg|thumb|left|Ku Klux Klan members march down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. in 1928]]\nIn Alabama, KKK [[vigilantes]] launched a wave of physical terror in 1927.

Sheriffs cracked down on activities. In the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]], the state voters overcame their initial opposition to the Catholic candidate [[Al Smith]], and voted the Democratic Party line as usual.\n\nAlthough in decline, a measure of the Klan's influence was still evident when it staged its march along [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1928. By 1930, Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6,000. Small independent units continued to be active in the industrial city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].\n\nKKK units were active through the 1930s in parts of Georgia, with a group of \"night riders\" in [[Atlanta]] enforcing their moral views by flogging people who violated them, whites as well as blacks. In March 1940, they were implicated in the beating murders of a young white couple taken from their car on a lovers lane, and flogged a white barber to death for drinking, both in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta. More than 20 others were \"brutally flogged\". As the police began to investigate, they found the records of the KKK had disappeared from their East Point office.

With access to dynamite and using the skills from their jobs in mining and steel, in the late 1940s some Klan members in Birmingham used bombings to destroy houses in order to intimidate upwardly mobile blacks who moved into middle-class neighborhoods. \"By mid-1949, there were so many charred house carcasses that the area [College Hills] was informally named Dynamite Hill.\"<ref name=Carry />\n\nActivism by these independent KKK groups in Birmingham increased as a reaction to the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s.

Investigators in the 1920s used KKK publicity, court cases, expos\u00e9s by disgruntled Klansmen, newspaper reports, and speculation to write stories about what the Klan was doing. Almost all the major national newspapers and magazines were hostile to its activities. The historian Thomas R. Pegram says that published accounts exaggerated the official viewpoint of the Klan leadership, and repeated the interpretations of hostile newspapers and the Klan's enemies. There was almost no evidence in that time regarding the behavior or beliefs of individual Klansmen. According to Pegram, the resulting popular and scholarly interpretation of the Klan from the 1920s into the mid-20th century emphasized its Southern roots and the violent vigilante-style actions of the Klan in its efforts to turn back the clock of modernity. Scholars compared it to [[fascism]] in   Europe.<ref>David M. Chalmers, ''Hooded Americanism: The First Century of the Ku Klux Klan, 1865\u20131965'' (1965) p. 322</ref> Amann states that, \"Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism \u2013 chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism \u2013 yet their differences were fundamental. ...

In terms of the Klan, it developed evidence based on the characteristics, beliefs, and behavior of the typical membership, and downplayed accounts by elite sources.<ref>Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'', p. 225</ref><ref>Leonard J.

''Reviews in American History'' 24#4, pp. 555\u2013573.</ref> Historians discovered membership lists and the minutes of local meetings from KKK chapters scattered around the country. They discovered that the original interpretation was largely mistaken about the membership and activities of the Klan; the membership was not anti-modern, rural or rustic and consisted of fairly well educated middle-class joiners and community activists. Half the members lived in the fast-growing industrial cities of the period: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, were Klan strongholds during the 1920s.<ref>Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915\u20131930'' (1967)</ref>\n\nStudies developed as social history find that in general, the KKK membership in these cities was from the stable, successful middle classes, with few members drawn from the elite or the working classes. Pegram, reviewing the studies, concludes, \"the popular Klan of the 1920s, while diverse, was more of a civic exponent of white Protestant social values than a repressive hate group.\"<ref>Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aplUFE1XIcQC&pg=PA225 p.225] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414063733/http://books.google.com/books?id=aplUFE1XIcQC&pg=PA225 |date=April 14, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[Kelly J.

Baker]] (2017). ''Gospel According to the Klan: The KKK's Appeal to Protestant America, 1915\u20131930''. p. 11</ref>\n\n=====Indiana and Alabama=====\nIn Indiana, traditional political historians focused on notorious leaders, especially [[D. C. Stephenson]], the Grand Dragon of the [[Indiana Klan]], whose conviction for 1925 kidnap, rape, and murder of [[Madge Oberholtzer]] helped destroy the Ku Klux Klan movement nationwide. In his history of 1967, Kenneth Jackson already described the Klan of the 1920s as associated with cities and urbanization, with chapters often acting as a kind of fraternal organization to aid people coming from other areas.<ref>Jackson, ''The Klan in the Cities'', 1967</ref>\n\nSocial historian Leonard Moore titled his monograph ''Citizen Klansmen'' (1997) and contrasted the intolerant rhetoric of the group's leaders with the actions of most of the membership. The Klan was white Protestant, established Americans who were fearful of change: represented by new immigrants and black migrants to the North. They were highly suspicious of Catholics, Jews and blacks, who they believed subverted ideal Protestant moral standards. Violence was uncommon in most chapters. In Indiana, KKK members directed more threats and economic blacklisting primarily against fellow white Protestants for transgressions of community moral standards, such as adultery, [[Domestic violence|wife-beating]], [[gambling]] and heavy drinking. Up to one third of Indiana's Protestant men joined the order making it, Moore argued, \"a kind of interest group for average white Protestants who believed that their values should be dominant in their community and state.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard J.

They established the [[University of Notre Dame]], a major Catholic college near South Bend. In May 1924 when the KKK scheduled a regional meeting in the city, Notre Dame students blocked the Klansmen and stole some KKK regalia. The next day the Klansmen counterattacked. Finally the college president and the football coach [[Knute Rockne]] kept the students on campus to avert further violence.<ref>Arthur Hope.

[[Hugo Black]] was a member before becoming nationally famous; he focused on anti-Catholicism. But in rural Alabama the Klan continued to operate to enforce [[Jim Crow]]; its members resorted more often to violence against blacks for infringements of the social order of white supremacy.<ref>Glenn Feldman, ''Politics, Society, and the Klan in Alabama, 1915\u20131949'' (1999)</ref>\n\nRacial terrorism was used in smaller towns to suppress black political activity; Elbert Williams of [[Brownsville, Tennessee]] was lynched in 1940 for trying to organize black residents to register and vote.

They had no formal relationships with each other, or connection to the second KKK, except for the fact that they copied its terminology and costumes. Beginning in the 1950s, for instance, individual Klan groups in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], began to resist social change and blacks' efforts to improve their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods.  The white men worked in mining and steel industries, with access to these materials. There were so many bombings of blacks' homes in Birmingham by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city was nicknamed \"[[Bombingham]]\".<ref name=\"McWhorter\" />\n\nDuring the tenure of [[Bull Connor]] as police commissioner in Birmingham, Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity. When the [[Freedom Riders]] arrived in Birmingham in 1961, Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack.<ref name=\"McWhorter\" /> When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists, the federal government began to establish intervention and protection.\n\nIn states such as Alabama and [[Mississippi]], Klan members forged alliances with governors' administrations.<ref name=\"McWhorter\" /> In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of [[civil rights]] activists. In some cases they used physical violence, intimidation, and assassination directly against individuals. Continuing [[disfranchisement]] of blacks across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were [[all-white juries|all-white]] and demonstrably biased verdicts and sentences.\n\n[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Goodman]], [[James Chaney|Chaney]], and [[Michael Schwerner|Schwerner]] were three civil rights workers abducted and murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan.]]\nAccording to a report from the [[Southern Regional Council]] in [[Atlanta]], the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952.

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]]. In 2020, they will move to the new [[Globe Life Field]] after having played at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is borrowed from the famous [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]] of the same name.\n\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Washington Senators''', an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after the city's first AL ballclub, the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|second Washington Senators]], moved to [[Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] (the [[Washington Senators (1891\u201399)|original Washington Senators]] played primarily in the [[National League]] during the 1890s). After the {{MLBy|1971}} season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring.\n\nThe Rangers have made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then brought home their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games. In the [[2010 World Series]], the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)}}\n\n===Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)===\nWhen the  [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 to become the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and loss of its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two new teams for the 1961 season\u2013the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team. However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] under a 10-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, 1969, with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Political career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" Their only winning season was in {{MLBy|1969}} when [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 record, placing fourth in the AL East. [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. The concurrent rise of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) did not help the Senators' cause either.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} campaign, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12&nbsp;million (by comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8&nbsp;million), he would not renew the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer brought up by [[Arlington, Texas]], mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to obtain a major league sports team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners. Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, by a vote of 10 to 2, American League owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the New York Yankees.<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref> The nation's capital went without Major League Baseball for 33&nbsp;years until the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] who became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n===Texas Rangers (1972\u2013present)===\n\n====First years in Texas (1972\u20131984)====\n[[File:FrankLucchesiFlickr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Lucchesi]], Rangers manager from 1975 to 1977]]\n\nPrior to the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]], improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]], in preparation for the inaugural season of the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F-change|0}} throughout the summer. So, the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nolan Ryan]] pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1993.]]\n\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division-champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including the likes of [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/sports/sp-855_1_purchase-agreement Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"] August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment to $600,000 the following year.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html ESPN: \"A series of beneficial moves\" By Tom Farrey] November 1, 1999</ref> Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and he sold his stake in the team in 1998. Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193&nbsp;million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]]  opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250&nbsp;million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers], Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n====The lean years (2001\u20132004)====\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]] was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] seven times (2004\u20132009, 2011).]]\n\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a 10-year, $252&nbsp;million contract. The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West.

A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004. Despite injuries to Josh Hamilton and [[Ian Kinsler]], the Rangers held first place in their division for long stretches of the summer before fading after September 1, losing the division to the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers finished the season at 87\u201375, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the AL West. Michael Young responded to his move to third base by posting one of his best offensive seasons ever while committing just nine errors and earning a sixth-straight All-Star appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=4566 |title=Michael Young Stats \u2013 Texas Rangers \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=1976-10-19 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> Josh Hamilton and [[Nelson Cruz]] were also named 2009 AL All-Stars.\n\n====Rangers Baseball Express, LLC====\nFollowing financial problems, including defaulting on a $525&nbsp;million loan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/7478 |title=Tom Hicks' Sports Group Defaults On $525 Million In Loans |publisher=FINalternatives |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> [[Tom Hicks]] and Hicks Sports Group reached an agreement to sell the Texas Rangers to group headed by Pittsburgh sports lawyer [[Chuck Greenberg (businessman)|Chuck Greenberg]] and Rangers team president Nolan Ryan for approximately $570&nbsp;million on January 22, 2010.<ref name=\"mlb.mlb.com\">[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&content_id=7958194&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex&partnerId=rss_tex Hicks' sale of Rangers finalized] ''MLB.com''</ref> Hicks also sold much of the land surrounding Rangers Ballpark to Greenberg and Ryan's group in a separate deal.\n\nHowever, one of HSG's principal lenders, [[Monarch Alternative Capital]], opposed the sale on grounds that the proceeds would not fully repay the defaulted HSG notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4309:brown-time-for-mlb-to-play-hardball-on-the-texas-rangers-sale&catid=26:editorials&Itemid=39 |title=Brown: Time for MLB to Play Hardball on the Texas Rangers Sale |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> On April 21, Major League Baseball issued a statement declaring the Rangers' sale to be under the control of the Commissioner to expedite the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/04/mlb-statement-on-rangers-sale.html |title=MLB statement on Rangers sale : Texas Rangers Blog &#124; |work=The Dallas Morning News |publisher=Rangersblog.dallasnews.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |url=http://startelegramsports.typepad.com/foul_territory/2010/04/mlb-says-its-in-control-of-sale.html |title=Foul Territory: MLB says it's in control of sale |publisher=Startelegramsports.typepad.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref> As the stalemate between HSG and its creditors continued, the Texas Rangers filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] on May 24.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2010/05/24/2010-05-24_arod_takes_a_hit_texas_rangers_file_for_bankrupcty_could_cost_yankees_alex_rodri.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=A-Rod takes a hit: Texas Rangers file for bankruptcy, could cost Yankees' Alex Rodriguez $25 million | first1=Bill | last1=Madden | first2=Corky | last2=Siemaszko | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\">{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2010/05/24/texas-rangers-owe-alex-rodriguez-249-million/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Texas Rangers Owe Alex Rodriguez $24.9 Million | first=Eric | last=Morath | date=May 24, 2010}}</ref> As of that date, the Rangers and HSG had an estimated debt of $575&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"blogs.wsj.com\"/> Much of the unsecured debt was owed in back salary.

In June 2012, Busby moved back to television play-by-play after [[Dave Barnett]] left his position as game announcer following an episode in which he experienced speech difficulties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/texas-rangers/rangersheadlines/2012/11/02/broadcaster-dave-barnett-wishes-things-ended-differently-with-rangers|title=Broadcaster Dave Barnett wishes things ended differently with Rangers|date=2012-11-02|work=SportsDay|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}</ref> Beginning in 2016, Raymond substituted for Busby on select games.

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League West|West division]]. In 2020, they will move to the new [[Globe Life Field]] after having played at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]] from 1994 to 2019. The team's name is borrowed from the famous [[Texas Ranger Division|law enforcement agency]] of the same name.\n\nThe franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Washington Senators''', an [[expansion team]] awarded to [[Washington, D.C.]], after the city's first AL ballclub, the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|second Washington Senators]], moved to [[Minnesota]] and became the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] (the [[Washington Senators (1891\u201399)|original Washington Senators]] played primarily in the [[National League]] during the 1890s). After the {{MLBy|1971}} season, the new Senators moved to Arlington, and debuted as the Rangers the following spring.\n\nThe Rangers have made eight appearances in the MLB postseason, seven following division championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, 2011, 2015, and 2016 and as a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division Series for the first time, defeating the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The team then brought home their [[2010 American League Championship Series|first American League pennant]] after beating the [[New York Yankees]] in six games. In the [[2010 World Series]], the franchise's first, the Rangers fell to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in five games. They repeated as American League champions the following year, then lost the [[2011 World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)}}\n\n===Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)===\nWhen the  [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 to become the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off the twin threats of competition from the proposed [[Continental League]] and loss of its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As part of the expansion, the American League added two new teams for the 1961 season\u2013the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] and a new Washington Senators team. However, the new Senators were (and still are) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to the new [[District of Columbia Stadium]] under a 10-year lease.\n\n[[File:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing [[Opening Day]] [[ceremonial first pitch]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] on April 7, 1969, with [[Ted Williams]] (left) and [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators: \"Washington: [[Henry Lee III#Political career|first in war, first in peace]] and ''still'' last in the American League.\" Their only winning season was in {{MLBy|1969}} when [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] managed the club to an 86\u201376 record, placing fourth in the AL East. [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], an [[outfielder]]/[[first baseman]] from 1965 to 1972 known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles. The concurrent rise of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] to regular championship contenders (winning their first World Series in {{wsy|1966}}) did not help the Senators' cause either.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Following their brief success in 1969, owner [[Bob Short]] was forced to make many questionable trades to lower the debt he had incurred to pay for the team. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} campaign, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (by comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and would move the team elsewhere.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer brought up by [[Arlington, Texas]], mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to obtain a major league sports team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to relocate his baseball team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed and ultimately declined by the other AL team owners. Arlington's [[hole card]] was [[Turnpike Stadium]], a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to MLB specifications, and only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate major league crowds.\n\nVandergriff's offer of a multimillion-dollar down payment prompted Short to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, by a vote of 10 to 2, American League owners granted approval to move the franchise to Arlington for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref> Senators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the Senators leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the New York Yankees.<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref> The nation's capital went without Major League Baseball for 33&nbsp;years until the relocation of the [[National League]]'s [[Montreal Expos]] who became the [[Washington Nationals]].\n\n===Texas Rangers (1972\u2013present)===\n\n====First years in Texas (1972\u20131984)====\n[[File:FrankLucchesiFlickr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Lucchesi]], Rangers manager from 1975 to 1977]]\n\nPrior to the [[1972 Major League Baseball season|1972 season]], improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]], in preparation for the inaugural season of the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at the hands of the [[California Angels]], their 1961 expansion cousins. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels, 5\u20131, for the club's first victory.\n\nIn 1974, the Rangers experienced their first winning season after finishing last in both 1972 and 1973. Under the ownership of [[Brad Corbett]], they finished second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[Oakland Athletics]]. The [[1974 Texas Rangers season|1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded [[American League Rookie of the Year]], [[Billy Martin]] was named [[AL Manager of the Year]], [[Jeff Burroughs]] won [[AL MVP]], and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the [[Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. The team posted winning records again from 1977 to 1979 but fell short of reaching the playoffs. The Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in 1981, but wound up losing the first half of the AL West by one-and-a-half games to Oakland at the time of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Texas went on to finish under .500 each season through 1985.\n\nThe Rangers faced an attendance problem for a few years in Texas, due in part to both the team's inconsistent performance and the oppressive heat and humidity that can encompass the area in the summer. Until the [[Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F-change|0}} throughout the summer. So, the Rangers began playing most of their weekend games between May and September at night, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\n====Valentine, Ryan, and Bush (1985\u20131994)====\n[[File:Nolan Ryan Tiger Stadium 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nolan Ryan]] pitched for the Rangers from 1989 to 1993.]]\n\nManager [[Bobby Valentine]] became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished the season in second place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division-champion Angels. The season marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the 1989 season allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and 6th and 7th [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Despite powerful lineups including the likes of [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], Rub\u00e9n Sierra, [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], Bobby Witt, [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], Valentine's Rangers never finished above second place and he was relieved of his duties during the 1992 season.\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]] for $89 million.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-27/sports/sp-855_1_purchase-agreement Los Angeles Times: \"Chiles Reaches Agreement on Sale of Rangers\"] August 27, 1988</ref> While his own equity in the team was a small one ($500,000), Bush was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment to $600,000 the following year.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html ESPN: \"A series of beneficial moves\" By Tom Farrey] November 1, 1999</ref> Bush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and he sold his stake in the team in 1998. Bush went on to be elected [[President of the United States]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].\n\nDuring Bush's tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging Arlington Stadium with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991, on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]).\n\nIn 1993, [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September; Nolan Ryan also retired after that season. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the AL West prior to the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]] which prompted commissioner [[Bud Selig]] to cancel the remainder of the season and the playoffs. On July 28, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in major league history in Arlington against the California Angels.\n\n====First division titles (1995\u20132000)====\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Globe Life Park]]  opened in 1994.]]\n\n[[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager in 1995. Oates and company helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division Championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the New York Yankees, 3 games to 1. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]] was named AL MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters including Gonz\u00e1lez, [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], and [[Rusty Greer]], but continued to struggle with pitching despite having [[Rick Helling]] and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive AL West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three World Series in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team was to be the last playoff-bound team until 2010. En route to a second-straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28&nbsp;games into the 2001 season.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W. Bush and the Texas Rangers], Espn.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-04.</ref>\n\n====The lean years (2001\u20132004)====\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]] was selected for the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] seven times (2004\u20132009, 2011).]]\n\nPrior to the 2001 season, star free agent shortstop [[Alex Rodriguez]] was signed by the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in baseball history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was controversial and is frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle, and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season and was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]]. The 2003 season signified the Rangers' fourth-straight last-place finish, and after a postseason fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning AL MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infield prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nThe Rangers battled with the [[Anaheim Angels]] and Oakland Athletics for first place in the AL West for much of the 2004 season. [[Mark Teixeira]], Alfonso Soriano, [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano being selected for the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2 for 3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Despite a late-season push, the Rangers ended up losing six of their final ten games and finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n====Making changes (2005\u20132009)====\n[[File:Nelson Cruz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Cruz]], Rangers outfielder from 2006 to 2013]]\n\nIn 2005, the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries. [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] stepped down as general manager following the 2005 season. [[Jon Daniels]] was promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, became the youngest general manager in major league history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in acquiring new players before and during the 2006 season. New acquisitions included [[Brad Wilkerson]], [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]], [[Kevin Millwood]], [[Carlos Lee]], and [[Nelson Cruz]]. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West. Buck Showalter was dismissed as manager after the season. The team hired Oakland third base coach [[Ron Washington]] as their next manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061105&content_id=1733731|title=Rangers select Washington to manage|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|publisher=MLB.com|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref> A change at manager was the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy offseason.

A number of roster moves before the 2007 trade deadline were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. Daniels' objective was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season exceptionally well, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the All Star Game: Hamilton, [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and Michael Young, who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers finished the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the AL West, the club's best finish since 1999. The 2009 season saw the Rangers soar into playoff contention for the first time since 2004.
