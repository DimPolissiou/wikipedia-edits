The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the [[Normandy landings]]. A 1,200-plane [[Airborne forces|airborne assault]] preceded an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] involving more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the [[English Channel]] on 6 June, and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August.\n\nThe decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the [[Washington Conference (1943)|Trident Conference]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in May 1943. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]], and General [[Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of [[Normandy]] of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed [[Utah Beach|Utah]] and [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], the British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and [[Gold Beach|Gold]], and the Canadians at [[Juno Beach|Juno]]. To meet the conditions expected on the [[Normandy]] beachhead, special technology was developed, including two artificial ports called [[Mulberry harbour]]s and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]]. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial [[military deception]], [[Operation Bodyguard]], using both electronic and visual misinformation. This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] placed German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] in charge of developing fortifications all along Hitler's proclaimed [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an invasion.\n\nThe Allies failed to accomplish their objectives for the first day, but gained a tenuous foothold that they gradually expanded when they captured the port at [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] on 26 June and the city of [[Caen]] on 21 July. A failed counterattack by German forces on 8 August left 50,000 soldiers of the [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]]. The Allies launched a second invasion from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] of southern France (code-named [[Operation Dragoon]]) on 15 August, and the [[Liberation of Paris]] followed on 25 August. German forces retreated east across the [[Seine]] on 30 August 1944, marking the close of Operation Overlord.\n\n== Preparations for D-Day ==\nIn June 1940, Germany's leader [[Adolf Hitler]] had triumphed in what he called \"the most famous victory in history\"\u2014the [[fall of France]].{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=322}} British craft evacuated to England over 338,000 Allied troops trapped along the northern coast of France (including much of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF)) in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] (27 May to 4 June).{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} British planners reported to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] on 4 October that even with the help of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and the United States, it would not be possible to regain a foothold in continental Europe in the near future.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=20}} After the Axis [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] began pressing for a [[Western Front (World War II)#1944\u201345: The Second Front|second front]] in Western Europe. Churchill declined because he felt that even with American help the British did not have adequate forces for such a strike,{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=8\u201310}} and he wished to avoid costly frontal assaults such as those that had occurred at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=582}} Two tentative plans code-named [[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]] and [[Operation Sledgehammer]] were put forward for 1942\u201343, but neither was deemed by the British to be practical or likely to succeed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=21\u201322}} Instead, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] expanded their activity in the Mediterranean, launching the [[Operation Torch|invasion]] of [[French North Africa]] in November 1942, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, and [[Allied invasion of Italy|invading Italy]] in September.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=10\u201311}} These campaigns provided the troops with valuable experience in [[amphibious warfare]].{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=319}}\n\nAttendees at the [[Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943 took the decision to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=11}} Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]], but the Americans, who were providing the bulk of the men and equipment, over-ruled him.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=10}} British Lieutenant-General [[Frederick E. Morgan]] was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=11}} The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=177\u2013178, chart p. 180}} In part because of lessons learned in the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=9}} The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly [[close air support]], and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=23}} The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoon]] greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|pp=397, 478}} Morgan considered four sites for the landings: [[Brittany]], the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], Normandy, and the [[Pas de Calais]]. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n[[File:Shermans-loaded-in-LCT.jpg|thumb|left|US Army [[M4 Sherman]] tanks loaded in a [[landing craft tank]] (LCT), ready for the invasion of France, c. late May or early June 1944]]\n\nPas de Calais, the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, was the location of launch sites for [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket]]s, then still under development.{{efn|name=Rockets}} The Germans regarded it as the most likely initial landing zone, and accordingly made it the most heavily fortified region.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=33\u201334}} It offered the Allies few opportunities for expansion, however, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals,{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was therefore chosen as the landing site.{{sfn|Ambrose|1994|pp=73\u201374}} The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast\u2014the lack of port facilities\u2014would be overcome through the development of artificial harbours.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}}\n\nThe COSSAC staff planned to begin the invasion on 1 May 1944.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF).{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12\u201313}} On 31 December 1943, Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the COSSAC plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three [[Division (military)|divisions]], with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted on expanding the scale of the initial invasion to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to speed up the capture of the port at Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant delaying the invasion until June 1944.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12\u201313}} Eventually the Allies committed 39 divisions to the Battle of Normandy: 22 American, 12 British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=684}} all under overall British command.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=521\u2013533}}{{efn|name=British command}}\n\n=== Allied invasion plan ===\n[[File:Allied Invasion Force.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Normandy landings|D-day]] assault routes into Normandy]]\n\n\"Overlord\" was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale [[lodgement]] on the Continent.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=642}} The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was code-named [[Operation Neptune]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} To gain the required air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies launched a bombing campaign (codenamed [[Operation Pointblank]]) to target German aircraft-production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Under the [[Transport Plan]], communications infrastructure and road and rail links were bombed to cut off the north of France and to make it more difficult to bring up reinforcements. These attacks were widespread so as to avoid revealing the exact location of the invasion.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} Elaborate [[military deception|deceptions]] were planned to prevent the Germans from determining the timing and location of the invasion.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe coastline of Normandy was divided into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a [[spelling alphabet]]\u2014from Able, west of [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], to Roger on the east flank of [[Sword Beach|Sword]]. Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include [[Utah Beach|Utah]] on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White.{{sfn|Buckingham|2004|p=88}}\n\nAllied planners envisaged preceding the sea-borne landings with airborne drops: near Caen on the eastern flank to secure the [[Orne (river)|Orne River]] bridges, and north of [[Carentan]] on the western flank. The initial goal was to capture Carentan, [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]], [[Bayeux]], and Caen. The Americans, assigned to land at Utah and Omaha, were to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and [[Gold Beach|Gold]], and the Canadians at [[Juno Beach|Juno]], were to capture Caen and form a front line from [[Caumont-l'\u00c9vent\u00e9]] to the south-east of Caen in order to protect the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Anglo-Canadian forces a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]]. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory captured north of the [[Avranches]]-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the [[River Seine]].{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592\u2013593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}}{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=78, 81}}\n\nThe invasion fleet, led by Admiral Sir [[Bertram Ramsay]], was split into the Western Naval Task Force (under Admiral [[Alan G Kirk]]) supporting the American sectors and the Eastern Naval Task Force (under Admiral Sir [[Philip Vian]]) in the British and Canadian sectors.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=594}}{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|p=6}} The American forces of the [[First Army (United States)|First Army]], led by Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], comprised [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] (Utah) and [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] (Omaha). On the British side, Lieutenant-General [[Miles Dempsey]] commanded the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]], under which [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] was assigned to Gold and [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] to Juno and Sword.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|loc=Map, p. 12}} Land forces were under the overall command of Montgomery, and air command was assigned to [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=25}} The [[First Canadian Army]] included personnel and units from [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Poland]], Belgium, and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=x}} Other Allied nations also participated.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=623}}\n\n=== Reconnaissance ===\n[[File:Air plan for landings in Normandy June 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of southern Britain, northern France and Belgium, marked with the routes the Allied air and naval invasion forces used in the D-Day landings, areas where Allied aircraft patrolled, locations of railway targets that were attacked, and areas where airfields could be built|Air plan for the Allied landing in Normandy]]\nThe [[Allied Expeditionary Air Force]] undertook over 3,200 photo-reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 until the start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. To avoid alerting the Germans as to the location of the invasion, this work had to be undertaken over the entire European coastline. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=81}} Members of [[Combined Operations Pilotage Parties]] clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including [[depth sounding]]s.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=21}}\n\nAn appeal for holiday pictures and postcards of Europe announced on the [[BBC]] produced over ten million items, some of which proved useful. Information collected by the [[French resistance]] helped provide details on Axis troop movements and on construction techniques used by the Germans for bunkers and other defensive installations.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=11}}\n\nMany German radio messages were encoded using the [[Enigma machine]] and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at [[Bletchley Park]] worked to break codes as quickly as possible to provide advance information on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information [[Ultra]] intelligence as it could only be provided to the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Oberbefehlshaber'' West (Supreme Commander West; [[OB West]]), commander of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n=== Technology ===\n[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Beetle-Pontoons 1 90.jpg|thumb|Remains of [[Mulberry harbour]] B at [[Arromanches-les-Bains]] (Gold) as seen in 1990]]\n\nIn response to the lessons learned at the disastrous Dieppe Raid, the Allies developed new technologies to help ensure the success of Overlord. To supplement the preliminary offshore bombardment and aerial assaults, some of the landing craft were equipped with artillery and anti-tank guns to provide close supporting fire.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=181}} The Allies had decided not to immediately attack any of the heavily protected French ports and two artificial ports, called [[Mulberry harbour]]s, were designed by COSSAC planners. Each assembly consisted of a floating outer [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], inner concrete [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] (called [[Phoenix breakwaters]]) and several floating piers.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=183}} The Mulberry harbours were supplemented by [[blockship]] shelters (codenamed \"Gooseberries\").{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=321}} With the expectation that fuel would be difficult or impossible to obtain on the continent, the Allies built a \"Pipe-Line Under The Ocean\" ([[Operation Pluto|PLUTO]]). Specially developed pipes {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter were to be laid under the Channel from the [[Isle of Wight]] to Cherbourg by D-Day plus 18. Technical problems and the delay in capturing Cherbourg meant the pipeline was not operational until 22 September. A second line was laid from [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] to Boulogne in late October.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nThe British military built a series of specialised tanks, nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]], to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy campaign. Developed under the supervision of Major-General [[Percy Hobart]], these were specially modified [[M4 Sherman]] and [[Churchill tank]]s. Examples include the [[Sherman Crab]] tank (equipped with a mine flail), the [[Churchill Crocodile]] (a flame-throwing tank), and the [[Churchill Ark|Armoured Ramp Carrier]], which other tanks could use as a bridge to scale sea-walls or to overcome other obstacles.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=182}} In some areas, the beaches consisted of a soft clay that could not support the weight of tanks. The \"[[Hobart's Funnies#Designs|bobbin]]\" tank would overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface and leaving the material in place as a route for more conventional tanks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=195}} The [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVREs) were modified for many tasks, including laying bridges and firing large charges into [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=208}} The Duplex-Drive tank ([[DD tank]]), another design developed by Hobart's group, was a self-propelled amphibious tank kept afloat using a waterproof canvas screen inflated with compressed air.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=42\u201343}} These tanks were easily swamped, and on D-Day many sank before reaching the shore, especially at Omaha.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=73}}\n\n=== Deception ===\n{{See also|Military deception}}\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted [[Operation Bodyguard]], the overall strategy designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=680}} [[Operation Fortitude]] included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio-traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway,{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=465}} and Fortitude South, a major deception designed to fool the Germans into believing that the landings would take place at Pas de Calais in July. A fictitious [[First U.S. Army Group]] was invented, supposedly located in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]] under the command of Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]]. The Allies constructed dummy tanks, trucks, and landing craft, and positioned them near the coast. Several military units, including [[II Canadian Corps]] and [[2nd Canadian Division]], moved into the area to bolster the illusion that a large force was gathering there.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=71\u201372}} As well as the broadcast of fake radio-traffic, genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}} Patton remained stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=282}} Military and civilian personnel alike were aware of the need for secrecy, and the invasion troops were as much as possible kept isolated, especially in the period immediately before the invasion. One American general was sent back to the United States in disgrace after revealing the invasion date at a party.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe Germans thought they had an extensive network of spies operating in the UK, but in fact all their agents had been captured, and some had become [[double agent]]s working for the Allies as part of the [[Double-Cross System]]. The double agent [[Juan Pujol Garc\u00eda]], a Spanish opponent of the Nazis known by the code name \"Garbo\", developed over the two years leading up to D-Day a fake network of informants that the Germans believed were collecting intelligence on their behalf. In the months preceding D-Day, Pujol sent hundreds of messages to his superiors in Madrid, messages specially prepared by the British intelligence service to convince the Germans that the attack would come in July at Calais.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=4}}\n\nMany of the German radar stations on the French coast were destroyed by the RAF in preparation for the landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} On the night before the invasion, in [[Operation Taxable]], [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] dropped strips of \"window\", [[Chaff (countermeasure)|metal foil]] that caused a radar return mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing [[barrage balloon]]s. [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]] also dropped \"window\" near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in [[Operation Glimmer]]. On the same night, a small group of [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) operators deployed dummy paratroopers over [[Le Havre]] and Isigny. These dummies led the Germans to believe an additional airborne assault had occurred.{{sfn|Bickers|1994|pp=19\u201321}}\n\n=== Rehearsals and security ===\n[[File:Invasion Training in England 04.jpg|thumb|left|Training exercise with [[live ammunition]] ]]\n\nTraining exercises for the Overlord landings took place as early as July 1943.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=35}} As the nearby beach resembled the planned Normandy landing-site, the town of [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton in Devon]], was evacuated in December 1943, and taken over by the armed forces as a site for training exercises that included the use of landing craft and the management of beach obstacles.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|pp=50\u201351, 54\u201357}} A [[friendly fire]] incident there on 27 April 1944 resulted in as many as 450 deaths.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=254}} The following day, an additional estimated 749 American soldiers and sailors died when [[E-boat|German torpedo-boats]] surprised members of Assault Force \"U\" conducting [[Exercise Tiger]].{{sfn|Fenton|2004}}{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=227}} Exercises with landing craft and live ammunition also took place at the Combined Training Centre in [[Inveraray]] in Scotland.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=36}} Naval exercises took place in Northern Ireland, and medical teams in London and elsewhere rehearsed how they would handle the expected waves of casualties.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|pp=59, 61}} Paratroopers conducted exercises, including a huge demonstration drop on 23 March 1944 observed by Churchill, Eisenhower, and other top officials.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nAllied planners considered tactical surprise to be a necessary element of the plan for the landings.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=46}} Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas at the end of May, with no further communication with the outside world.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=30}} Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=30, 36}} A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}} Travel to and from the [[Republic of Ireland]] was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=667}}\n\n=== Weather forecasting ===\n[[File:6thAirdivnormandybriefing.jpg|thumb|Men of the British 22nd Independent Parachute Company, [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] being briefed for the invasion, 4\u20135 June 1944]]\nThe invasion planners specified a set of conditions regarding the timing of the invasion, deeming only a few days in each month suitable. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the [[Spring tides|highest tides]]. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles the enemy had placed on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men had to spend exposed in the open. Specific criteria were also set for wind speed, visibility, and cloud cover.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=33}}\n\nBy the evening of 4 June, the Allied meteorological team, headed by Group Captain [[James Stagg]] of the [[Royal Air Force]], predicted that the weather would improve sufficiently so that the invasion could go ahead on 6 June. He met Eisenhower and other senior commanders at their headquarters at [[Southwick House]] in Hampshire to discuss the situation.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=21}} General Montgomery and Major General [[Walter Bedell Smith]], Eisenhower's chief of staff, were eager to launch the invasion. Admiral Bertram Ramsay was prepared to commit his ships, while Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory expressed concern that the conditions would be unfavourable for Allied aircraft. After much discussion, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=224\u2013226}} Allied control of the Atlantic meant that German meteorologists did not have access to as much information as the Allies on incoming weather patterns.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris predicted two weeks of stormy weather, many [[Wehrmacht]] commanders left their posts to attend war games in [[Rennes]], and men in many units were given leave.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=131}} Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet Hitler to try to get more Panzers.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nHad Eisenhower postponed the invasion, the next available period with the right combination of tides (but without the desirable full moon) was two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. As it happened, during this period the invaders would have encountered a major storm lasting four days, between 19 and 22 June, that would have made the initial landings impossible.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=33}}\n\n=== German preparations and defences ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-263-1580-05, Atlantikwall, Soldaten der Legion \"Freies Indien\".jpg|thumb|German troops of the [[Indian Legion]] on the [[Atlantic Wall]] in France, 21 March 1944]]\nNazi Germany had at its disposal 50 divisions in France and the Low Countries, with another 18 stationed in Denmark and Norway.{{efn|name=Other divisions}} Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany, but there was no strategic reserve.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=144}} The Calais region was defended by the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]] under ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (Colonel General) [[Hans von Salmuth]], and Normandy by the [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] commanded by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Friedrich Dollmann]].{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=34}}{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|p=13}} Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], meant the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw.

In addition to concrete gun-emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles to be placed on the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and to impede the movement of tanks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=54\u201356}} Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high-tide mark.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=54\u201356}} On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} Given the Allied air supremacy (4,029 Allied aircraft assigned to operations in Normandy plus 5,514 aircraft assigned to bombing and defence, versus 570 Luftwaffe planes stationed in France and the Low Countries{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}}), booby-trapped stakes known as ''Rommelspargel'' ([[Rommel's asparagus]]) were set up in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}}\n\n==== Mobile reserves ====\nRommel, believing that the Germans' best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore, requested that mobile reserves\u2014especially tanks\u2014be stationed as close to the coast as possible. Rundstedt, General [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]] (commander of [[Panzer Group West]]), and other senior commanders believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. Geyr also noted that in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] the armour stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that because of the overwhelming Allied air superiority, large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was underway. Hitler made the final decision: he left three divisions under Geyr's command and gave Rommel operational control of three tank-divisions as reserves. Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=31}}{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=15}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=192}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n{{Main|Invasion of Normandy|Normandy landings}}\n{{quote|text=You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months.

The operation was launched on 6 June 1944 with the [[Normandy landings]]. A 1,200-plane [[Airborne forces|airborne assault]] preceded an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] involving more than 5,000 vessels. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the [[English Channel]] on 6 June, and more than two million Allied troops were in France by the end of August.\n\nThe decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion in 1944 was taken at the [[Washington Conference (1943)|Trident Conference]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in May 1943. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]], and General [[Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of [[Normandy]] of northwestern France was chosen as the site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed [[Utah Beach|Utah]] and [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], the British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and [[Gold Beach|Gold]], and the Canadians at [[Juno Beach|Juno]]. To meet the conditions expected on the [[Normandy]] beachhead, special technology was developed, including two artificial ports called [[Mulberry harbour]]s and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]]. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial [[military deception]], [[Operation Bodyguard]], using both electronic and visual misinformation. This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. F\u00fchrer [[Adolf Hitler]] placed German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] in charge of developing fortifications all along Hitler's proclaimed [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an invasion.\n\nThe Allies failed to accomplish their objectives for the first day, but gained a tenuous foothold that they gradually expanded when they captured the port at [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] on 26 June and the city of [[Caen]] on 21 July. A failed counterattack by German forces on 8 August left 50,000 soldiers of the [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|7th Army]] trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]]. The Allies launched a second invasion from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] of southern France (code-named [[Operation Dragoon]]) on 15 August, and the [[Liberation of Paris]] followed on 25 August. German forces retreated east across the [[Seine]] on 30 August 1944, marking the close of Operation Overlord.\n\n== Preparations for D-Day ==\nIn June 1940, Germany's leader [[Adolf Hitler]] had triumphed in what he called \"the most famous victory in history\"\u2014the [[fall of France]].{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=322}} British craft evacuated to England over 338,000 Allied troops trapped along the northern coast of France (including much of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF)) in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] (27 May to 4 June).{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} British planners reported to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] on 4 October that even with the help of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and the United States, it would not be possible to regain a foothold in continental Europe in the near future.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=20}} After the Axis [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] began pressing for a [[Western Front (World War II)#1944\u201345: The Second Front|second front]] in Western Europe. Churchill declined because he felt that even with American help the British did not have adequate forces for such a strike,{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=8\u201310}} and he wished to avoid costly frontal assaults such as those that had occurred at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=582}} Two tentative plans code-named [[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]] and [[Operation Sledgehammer]] were put forward for 1942\u201343, but neither was deemed by the British to be practical or likely to succeed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=21\u201322}} Instead, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] expanded their activity in the Mediterranean, launching the [[Operation Torch|invasion]] of [[French North Africa]] in November 1942, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, and [[Allied invasion of Italy|invading Italy]] in September.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=10\u201311}} These campaigns provided the troops with valuable experience in [[amphibious warfare]].{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=319}}\n\nAttendees at the [[Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943 took the decision to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=11}} Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]], but the Americans, who were providing the bulk of the men and equipment, over-ruled him.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=10}} British Lieutenant-General [[Frederick E. Morgan]] was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=11}} The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=177\u2013178, chart p. 180}} In part because of lessons learned in the [[Dieppe Raid]] of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=9}} The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly [[close air support]], and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=23}} The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoon]] greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|pp=397, 478}} Morgan considered four sites for the landings: [[Brittany]], the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], Normandy, and the [[Pas de Calais]]. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n[[File:Shermans-loaded-in-LCT.jpg|thumb|left|US Army [[M4 Sherman]] tanks loaded in a [[landing craft tank]] (LCT), ready for the invasion of France, c. late May or early June 1944]]\n\nPas de Calais, the closest point in continental Europe to Britain, was the location of launch sites for [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket]]s, then still under development.{{efn|name=Rockets}} The Germans regarded it as the most likely initial landing zone, and accordingly made it the most heavily fortified region.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=33\u201334}} It offered the Allies few opportunities for expansion, however, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals,{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was therefore chosen as the landing site.{{sfn|Ambrose|1994|pp=73\u201374}} The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast\u2014the lack of port facilities\u2014would be overcome through the development of artificial harbours.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}}\n\nThe COSSAC staff planned to begin the invasion on 1 May 1944.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF).{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12\u201313}} On 31 December 1943, Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the COSSAC plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three [[Division (military)|divisions]], with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted on expanding the scale of the initial invasion to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to speed up the capture of the port at Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant delaying the invasion until June 1944.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12\u201313}} Eventually the Allies committed 39 divisions to the Battle of Normandy: 22 American, 12 British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=684}} all under overall British command.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=521\u2013533}}{{efn|name=British command}}\n\n=== Allied invasion plan ===\n[[File:Allied Invasion Force.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Normandy landings|D-day]] assault routes into Normandy]]\n\n\"Overlord\" was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale [[lodgement]] on the Continent.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=642}} The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was code-named [[Operation Neptune]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} To gain the required air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies launched a bombing campaign (codenamed [[Operation Pointblank]]) to target German aircraft-production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Under the [[Transport Plan]], communications infrastructure and road and rail links were bombed to cut off the north of France and to make it more difficult to bring up reinforcements. These attacks were widespread so as to avoid revealing the exact location of the invasion.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} Elaborate [[military deception|deceptions]] were planned to prevent the Germans from determining the timing and location of the invasion.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe coastline of Normandy was divided into seventeen sectors, with codenames using a [[spelling alphabet]]\u2014from Able, west of [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], to Roger on the east flank of [[Sword Beach|Sword]]. Eight further sectors were added when the invasion was extended to include [[Utah Beach|Utah]] on the Cotentin Peninsula. Sectors were further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White.{{sfn|Buckingham|2004|p=88}}\n\nAllied planners envisaged preceding the sea-borne landings with airborne drops: near Caen on the eastern flank to secure the [[Orne (river)|Orne River]] bridges, and north of [[Carentan]] on the western flank. The initial goal was to capture Carentan, [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]], [[Bayeux]], and Caen. The Americans, assigned to land at Utah and Omaha, were to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and capture the port facilities at Cherbourg. The British at Sword and [[Gold Beach|Gold]], and the Canadians at [[Juno Beach|Juno]], were to capture Caen and form a front line from [[Caumont-l'\u00c9vent\u00e9]] to the south-east of Caen in order to protect the American flank, while establishing airfields near Caen. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Anglo-Canadian forces a suitable staging area for a push south to capture the town of [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]]. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory captured north of the [[Avranches]]-Falaise line during the first three weeks. The Allied armies would then swing left to advance towards the [[River Seine]].{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592\u2013593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}}{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=78, 81}}\n\nThe invasion fleet, led by Admiral Sir [[Bertram Ramsay]], was split into the Western Naval Task Force (under Admiral [[Alan G Kirk]]) supporting the American sectors and the Eastern Naval Task Force (under Admiral Sir [[Philip Vian]]) in the British and Canadian sectors.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=594}}{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|p=6}} The American forces of the [[First Army (United States)|First Army]], led by Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], comprised [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] (Utah) and [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] (Omaha). On the British side, Lieutenant-General [[Miles Dempsey]] commanded the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]], under which [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] was assigned to Gold and [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] to Juno and Sword.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|loc=Map, p. 12}} Land forces were under the overall command of Montgomery, and air command was assigned to [[Air Chief Marshal]] Sir [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=25}} The [[First Canadian Army]] included personnel and units from [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Poland]], Belgium, and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=x}} Other Allied nations also participated.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=623}}\n\n=== Reconnaissance ===\n[[File:Air plan for landings in Normandy June 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=A map of southern Britain, northern France and Belgium, marked with the routes the Allied air and naval invasion forces used in the D-Day landings, areas where Allied aircraft patrolled, locations of railway targets that were attacked, and areas where airfields could be built|Air plan for the Allied landing in Normandy]]\nThe [[Allied Expeditionary Air Force]] undertook over 3,200 photo-reconnaissance sorties from April 1944 until the start of the invasion. Photos of the coastline were taken at extremely low altitude to show the invaders the terrain, obstacles on the beach, and defensive structures such as bunkers and gun emplacements. To avoid alerting the Germans as to the location of the invasion, this work had to be undertaken over the entire European coastline. Inland terrain, bridges, troop emplacements, and buildings were also photographed, in many cases from several angles, to give the Allies as much information as possible.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=81}} Members of [[Combined Operations Pilotage Parties]] clandestinely prepared detailed harbour maps, including [[depth sounding]]s.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=21}}\n\nAn appeal for holiday pictures and postcards of Europe announced on the [[BBC]] produced over ten million items, some of which proved useful. Information collected by the [[French resistance]] helped provide details on Axis troop movements and on construction techniques used by the Germans for bunkers and other defensive installations.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=11}}\n\nMany German radio messages were encoded using the [[Enigma machine]] and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at [[Bletchley Park]] worked to break codes as quickly as possible to provide advance information on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information [[Ultra]] intelligence as it could only be provided to the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Oberbefehlshaber'' West (Supreme Commander West; [[OB West]]), commander of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n=== Technology ===\n[[File:Arromanches Mulberry-Harbour Beetle-Pontoons 1 90.jpg|thumb|Remains of [[Mulberry harbour]] B at [[Arromanches-les-Bains]] (Gold) as seen in 1990]]\n\nIn response to the lessons learned at the disastrous Dieppe Raid, the Allies developed new technologies to help ensure the success of Overlord. To supplement the preliminary offshore bombardment and aerial assaults, some of the landing craft were equipped with artillery and anti-tank guns to provide close supporting fire.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=181}} The Allies had decided not to immediately attack any of the heavily protected French ports and two artificial ports, called [[Mulberry harbour]]s, were designed by COSSAC planners. Each assembly consisted of a floating outer [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], inner concrete [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] (called [[Phoenix breakwaters]]) and several floating piers.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=183}} The Mulberry harbours were supplemented by [[blockship]] shelters (codenamed \"Gooseberries\").{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=321}} With the expectation that fuel would be difficult or impossible to obtain on the continent, the Allies built a \"Pipe-Line Under The Ocean\" ([[Operation Pluto|PLUTO]]). Specially developed pipes {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter were to be laid under the Channel from the [[Isle of Wight]] to Cherbourg by D-Day plus 18. Technical problems and the delay in capturing Cherbourg meant the pipeline was not operational until 22 September. A second line was laid from [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] to Boulogne in late October.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nThe British military built a series of specialised tanks, nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]], to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy campaign. Developed under the supervision of Major-General [[Percy Hobart]], these were specially modified [[M4 Sherman]] and [[Churchill tank]]s. Examples include the [[Sherman Crab]] tank (equipped with a mine flail), the [[Churchill Crocodile]] (a flame-throwing tank), and the [[Churchill Ark|Armoured Ramp Carrier]], which other tanks could use as a bridge to scale sea-walls or to overcome other obstacles.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=182}} In some areas, the beaches consisted of a soft clay that could not support the weight of tanks. The \"[[Hobart's Funnies#Designs|bobbin]]\" tank would overcome this problem by deploying a roll of matting over the soft surface and leaving the material in place as a route for more conventional tanks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=195}} The [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVREs) were modified for many tasks, including laying bridges and firing large charges into [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=208}} The Duplex-Drive tank ([[DD tank]]), another design developed by Hobart's group, was a self-propelled amphibious tank kept afloat using a waterproof canvas screen inflated with compressed air.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=42\u201343}} These tanks were easily swamped, and on D-Day many sank before reaching the shore, especially at Omaha.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=73}}\n\n=== Deception ===\n{{See also|Military deception}}\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted [[Operation Bodyguard]], the overall strategy designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=680}} [[Operation Fortitude]] included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio-traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway,{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=465}} and Fortitude South, a major deception designed to fool the Germans into believing that the landings would take place at Pas de Calais in July. A fictitious [[First U.S. Army Group]] was invented, supposedly located in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]] under the command of Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]]. The Allies constructed dummy tanks, trucks, and landing craft, and positioned them near the coast. Several military units, including [[II Canadian Corps]] and [[2nd Canadian Division]], moved into the area to bolster the illusion that a large force was gathering there.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=71\u201372}} As well as the broadcast of fake radio-traffic, genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}} Patton remained stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=282}} Military and civilian personnel alike were aware of the need for secrecy, and the invasion troops were as much as possible kept isolated, especially in the period immediately before the invasion. One American general was sent back to the United States in disgrace after revealing the invasion date at a party.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe Germans thought they had an extensive network of spies operating in the UK, but in fact all their agents had been captured, and some had become [[double agent]]s working for the Allies as part of the [[Double-Cross System]]. The double agent [[Juan Pujol Garc\u00eda]], a Spanish opponent of the Nazis known by the code name \"Garbo\", developed over the two years leading up to D-Day a fake network of informants that the Germans believed were collecting intelligence on their behalf. In the months preceding D-Day, Pujol sent hundreds of messages to his superiors in Madrid, messages specially prepared by the British intelligence service to convince the Germans that the attack would come in July at Calais.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=4}}\n\nMany of the German radar stations on the French coast were destroyed by the RAF in preparation for the landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} On the night before the invasion, in [[Operation Taxable]], [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] dropped strips of \"window\", [[Chaff (countermeasure)|metal foil]] that caused a radar return mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing [[barrage balloon]]s. [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]] also dropped \"window\" near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in [[Operation Glimmer]]. On the same night, a small group of [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) operators deployed dummy paratroopers over [[Le Havre]] and Isigny. These dummies led the Germans to believe an additional airborne assault had occurred.{{sfn|Bickers|1994|pp=19\u201321}}\n\n=== Rehearsals and security ===\n[[File:Invasion Training in England 04.jpg|thumb|left|Training exercise with [[live ammunition]] ]]\n\nTraining exercises for the Overlord landings took place as early as July 1943.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=35}} As the nearby beach resembled the planned Normandy landing-site, the town of [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton in Devon]], was evacuated in December 1943, and taken over by the armed forces as a site for training exercises that included the use of landing craft and the management of beach obstacles.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|pp=50\u201351, 54\u201357}} A [[friendly fire]] incident there on 27 April 1944 resulted in as many as 450 deaths.{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=254}} The following day, an additional estimated 749 American soldiers and sailors died when [[E-boat|German torpedo-boats]] surprised members of Assault Force \"U\" conducting [[Exercise Tiger]].{{sfn|Fenton|2004}}{{sfn|Lewis|1990|p=227}} Exercises with landing craft and live ammunition also took place at the Combined Training Centre in [[Inveraray]] in Scotland.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|p=36}} Naval exercises took place in Northern Ireland, and medical teams in London and elsewhere rehearsed how they would handle the expected waves of casualties.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|pp=59, 61}} Paratroopers conducted exercises, including a huge demonstration drop on 23 March 1944 observed by Churchill, Eisenhower, and other top officials.{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nAllied planners considered tactical surprise to be a necessary element of the plan for the landings.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=46}} Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas at the end of May, with no further communication with the outside world.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=30}} Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=30, 36}} A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}} Travel to and from the [[Republic of Ireland]] was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=667}}\n\n=== Weather forecasting ===\n[[File:6thAirdivnormandybriefing.jpg|thumb|Men of the British 22nd Independent Parachute Company, [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|6th Airborne Division]] being briefed for the invasion, 4\u20135 June 1944]]\nThe invasion planners specified a set of conditions regarding the timing of the invasion, deeming only a few days in each month suitable. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the [[Spring tides|highest tides]]. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in.

Rundstedt, General [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]] (commander of [[Panzer Group West]]), and other senior commanders believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. Geyr also noted that in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] the armour stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that because of the overwhelming Allied air superiority, large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was underway. Hitler made the final decision: he left three divisions under Geyr's command and gave Rommel operational control of three tank-divisions as reserves.

The name derives from an obscure law known as the ''Jus Devolutionis'', used by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to claim they 'devolved' to him by right of marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].\n\nThe French encountered minimal resistance, but Louis was more concerned to assert his inheritance rights in the Spanish Empire, and returned much of his gains in the May 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The terms were agreed by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] in January 1668, reinforced by the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe conflict marked the end of the long-standing Franco-Dutch alliance, and was the first of the French wars of expansion that dominated Europe for the next 50 years.\n\n==Background==\nAs part of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] that ended the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|Franco-Spanish War]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] married [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the [[Spanish Empire]] remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by [[Kingdom of France|France]], Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold [[French \u00e9cu|\u00e9cus]], a huge sum that was never paid.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}}\n\nWhen [[Cardinal Mazarin]] died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=6}} [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], his Finance Minister, argued French economic growth required the [[Spanish Netherlands]], implying conflict with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], a long-term French ally. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] that confirmed Dutch independence also gave [[Amsterdam]] control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nBy 1663, Louis concluded the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=3}} As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in July 1665, providing an excuse for their military build up; Louis also calculated this made it harder for the Dutch to oppose him.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=298}} In September, Philip died, leaving his four year old son [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] as king, and his widow [[Mariana of Austria]] as regent. If Charles died, Leopold would inherit the Spanish Empire.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311-312}}\n[[File:Detail of Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Autriche by Nocret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maria Theresa of Spain]], whose unpaid dowry was used to justify the war]]\nFrench lawyers argued as the dowry remained unpaid, Maria Theresa's renunciation was invalid, and her rights \"devolved\" to Louis under the ''Jus Devolutionis'', an obscure law restricting inheritance to children from a first marriage. On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], the towns of [[Cambrai]], Antwerp and [[Mechelen]], [[Upper Guelders]], the counties of [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and related possessions.{{sfn|Wolf|1962|p=316}} It was dismissed by Leopold and Mariana, since it applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights but gave Louis a legal justification.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=33-34}}\n\nAware of French intentions, Mariana's government sought to end the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], agree an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship. Louis countered with the 1667 [[Treaty of Lisbon (1667)|Treaty of Lisbon]], a ten year alliance with Portugal, and paid potential opponents like [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to remain neutral.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=36}} Leopold was occupied with the [[Great Turkish War]], while Foreign Minister [[Hugues de Lionne]] also extended the anti-Austrian [[League of the Rhine]] until 1668.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=95-96}}\n\nOn 8 May, every French ambassador in Europe read out a declaration, claiming Louis was taking possession of lands that rightfully belonged to him. In mid-May, talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War opened in [[Breda]] between the Republic, [[Denmark-Norway]], France and England; shortly before, [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] learned Louis and Charles had secretly agreed terms in advance, increasing the pressure on the Dutch not to oppose French aims.{{sfn|Gooskens|2016|p=69}}\n\nThe imminence of war ended Spain's reluctance to accept Portuguese sovereignty; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 23 May, granted England substantial commercial privileges, in return for help in ending the war with Portugal.{{sfn|Fisher|Savelle|1967|pp=66-70}}\n\n==War==\n===May to September 1667; the Spanish Netherlands===\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Spanish Netherlands, 1667 campaign; note modern Franco-Belgian boundary, blue lines indicate rivers|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Oudenaarde|pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 3|lon_min = 36\n|label3 =Antwerp |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 13|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 24\n|label4 =Tournai |pos4=right|lat4_deg=50|lat4_min = 36|lon4_deg = 3|lon4_min = 23\n|label5= Charleroi|pos5=bottom|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 24|lon5_deg = 4|lon5_min = 26\n|label6 = Lille  |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 3 |lon6_min = 03\n|label7= Namur|pos7 = right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 28| lon7_deg = 4|lon7_min = 52\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9 = M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min =46 | lon9_deg =4 | lon9_min = 43\n|label10 = Sierck|pos10 = bottom|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min =26 | lon10_deg =6 | lon10_min = 21\n|label11 = Kortrijk|pos11 = left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min=50|lon11_deg =3 | lon11_min = 16\n|label12 = Brussels|pos12 = right|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min=41|lon12_deg =4 | lon12_min = 21\n|label13 = Dendermonde|pos13 = left|lat13_deg=51|lat13_min=02|lon13_deg =4 | lon13_min = 06\n|label14 = Aalst|pos14 = right|lat14_deg=50|lat14_min=56|lon14_deg =4 |lon14_min = 02\n}}\nAlso referred to as [[Flanders]], the Spanish Netherlands was a compact area, dominated by canals and rivers. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water; campaigns in this theatre focused on control of strongpoints along rivers such as the [[Lys (river)|Lys]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Childs|1991|pp=32-33}}\n\nAfter 1659, a series of military reforms initiated by [[Michel Le Tellier]] made the French army more professional, while improving its logistic support.{{sfn|Rowlands|2010|p=147}} This allowed them to put larger numbers in the field, for longer periods; by 1667, the army had an authorised strength of 80,000, of whom 51,000 were deployed for the campaign.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=106}}\n\n[[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] was appointed supreme commander; his main force of 35,000 men and the artillery train were concentrated around [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], on the River Meuse. Another 9,000 under [[Aumont family|Antoine de Rochebaron]] prepared to advance up the Lys, via [[Kortrijk]] and [[Oudenaarde]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy|de Cr\u00e9quy]] and 6,000 light cavalry were based at [[Sierck-les-Bains]], securing their flank against an attack from Germany. Accompanied by Louis and his entourage, the French crossed the border on 24 May.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|pp=299-300}}\n\nAware of these preparations, Spanish governor [[Francisco de Moura, 3rd Marquis of Castel Rodrigo|Castel Rodrigo]] urgently requested additional funds from Madrid. Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million [[escudos]] on her daughter's wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=34-36}}\n\nAlthough insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.{{sfn|Afflerbach|Strachan|2012|p=159}}\n[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Yser]] river, in [[Plain of Flanders|Maritime Flanders]]; a good example of the geography in this area]]\nTurenne's first objective was [[Charleroi]], a key Spanish supply base; Castel Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to [[Brussels]], first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, [[Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal|De Montal]] was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while [[Vauban]] began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured [[Tournai]], Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on [[Dendermonde]], intending to take Antwerp.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nOn 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castel Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt. Turenne withdrew and on 10 August [[Siege of Lille (1667)|besieged Lille]], capital of the [[Walloons|Walloon region]] and an important commercial centre.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nThe garrison were allowed to withdraw after surrendering on 28 August; three days later, [[John Gaspar Ferdinand de Marchin, Comte de Granville|de Marchin]] and a Spanish relief force of 12,000 ran into a French cavalry detachment on the Bruges road. Ordered to cut off his retreat, [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds|Bellefonds]] and de Cr\u00e9quy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both [[List of Marshals of France#Louis XIV, 1643\u20131715|Marshals of France]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=303}} On 12 September, Turenne captured [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=304}}\n\n===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===\n[[File:Johan de Witt 1652.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]]; he had to persuade Louis to withdraw, while keeping him as an ally]]\nOn 31 July 1667, the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} This was driven by the [[States of Zeeland]], supported by [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]], English ambassador in [[the Hague]] and [[Brussels]], and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's representative in London.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|p=5}}\n\nDe Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; 'to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=111}} Although he and Charles preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador in Sweden]], Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}}\n\nFrom April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=155}} Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and the general populace.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=7}} In England, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[City of London Corporation|business]] wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]]; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the [[Secret Treaty of Dover|1670 Treaty of Dover]].{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}} \n\nIn September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=4}}\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], ca 1661]]\nWhen Philip died in 1665, Spain's only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] was deposed by his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]], who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|p=47}} The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Newitt|2004|p=228}}\n\nTo fund the 1668 campaign, Castel-Rodrigo agreed a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castel-Rodrigo [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=50-52}}\n\nOn 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=144,152}} The [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] was signed by England and the Republic on 23 January, the third member, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=166}} It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n\nRuvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=12}} Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent [[Franco-Dutch War]], Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the 'ungrateful Dutch nation', but his reaction at the time was far more moderate.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=23}} The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, 'the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money'.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=26}} Lionne also pointed out the Alliance's guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms 'without it costing us a sou.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=156}}\n\n===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comt\u00e9===\n{{Location map many|France Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9|caption = Modern department of Bourgogne (left) and Franche-Comt\u00e9 (right); key locations 1668 campaign |border = black|width =300|float = right|relief=yes|\n|label  = Besan\u00e7on   |pos = right|lat_deg =47|lat_min  = 14|lon_deg  = 6|lon_min = 1\n|label2 = Dole       |pos2 = right |lat2_deg=47|lat2_min = 05|lon2_deg = 5|lon2_min = 30\n|label3 = Gray       |pos3 = right |lat3_deg=47|lat3_min  =27|lon3_deg = 5|lon3_min = 36\n|label4 = Vesoul     |pos4 = right|lat4_deg=47|lat4_min  =37|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 10\n|label5 = Salins-les-Bains|pos5 = bottom|lat5_deg  =46|lat5_min  =57|lon5_deg  = 5|lon5_min = 53\n|label6  = Dijon     |pos6 = top |lat6_deg  =47|lat6_min=19|lon6_deg = 5|lon6_min = 01\n|label7  = Nevers    |pos7 = right  |lat7_deg  =47|lat7_min=00|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 10\n|label8  = Auxonne   |pos8 = left   |lat8_deg  =47|lat8_min  =12|lon8_deg  = 5|lon8_min = 23\n}}\nThroughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=112}}\n\nThe operation was commanded by the [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince de Cond\u00e9]]. Once France's leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comt\u00e9 was considered part of [[Burgundy]], his family's traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.{{sfn|Swann|2003|p=44}}\n\nTo keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans]] would attack [[Catalonia]], with Cond\u00e9 in the [[Three Bishoprics]] to deter an attack from Germany.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|pp=20-21}}\n\nThis provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in [[Dijon]]; by early February, Cond\u00e9 had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near [[Auxonne]]. He divided the army into two columns, the other led by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and entered Franche-Comt\u00e9 on 4 February.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} [[Free City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]] and [[Salins-les-Bains]] surrendered on 7 February, after which Cond\u00e9 and Luxembourg moved onto [[Dole, Jura|Dole]], where they were joined by Louis on 9 February. His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 to 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of [[Gray, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Gray]] on 19th; Louis was back in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] on 24th.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=306}}\n\n===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===\nOn the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the [[Gaspar T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 5th Duke de Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], [[Viceroy of Catalonia]], invaded the [[Upper Cerdanya]] with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1997|p=9}} Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local ''[[miquelets]]'' combined with the French military in resisting the invasion.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1999|p=266}} Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.{{sfn|Jan\u00e9 Checa|2003|p=454}}\n\n===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===\nWith the largest army in Europe, Turenne, Cond\u00e9 and Orl\u00e9ans argued for continuing the war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, and while Colbert had initiated policies aimed at reducing its dependence on Dutch shipping for transporting goods, this would take time.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=153-154}} In addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg, [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] offered Mariana another 8,000 men. {{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=163}}\n\nIn February, seven year old Charles was reported to be suffering from [[smallpox]], an often fatal disease; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives without fighting. The combination decided him on peace; on 25 April, the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms, which were then incorporated into the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], signed by Spain and France on 2 May.{{sfn|Lesaffer}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map Peace of Aix la Chapelle (English).png|thumb|left|French gains by Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: Louis returned [[Cambrai]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]], but retained the rest]]\nFrance withdrew from Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, [[Armenti\u00e8res]], [[Bergues]] and [[Douai]] were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, [[Veurne]], [[Binche]], Charleroi and [[Ath]] made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=165}}\n\nFrom a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] began work on the defence line that became known as the ''Ceinture de fer''. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=31}}\n\nThe political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis' right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis' expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|1689 Grand Alliance]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=220}}\n\nThe role of the Triple Alliance in the peace is debated by modern historians, including [[Herbert H. Rowen|Herbert Rowen]], \"arguably the most important English-speaking historian of the Dutch Republic since [[John Lothrop Motley]]\".{{sfn|Harline |1999}} Its real significance was aligning English and Dutch objectives, despite the brief interruption in 1672 of the deeply unpopular [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]; the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=163-167}}\n\nConcern over French ambitions also revived the Orangist party, increasing internal political conflict with De Witt's Republican faction. One result was the deliberate neglect of the Dutch army, generally seen as bolstering the power of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]]; this had catastrophic repercussions in 1672.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=312-316}}\n\nLouis went to war in 1667 because he believed the Dutch would never voluntarily agree the concessions required. He now decided capturing the Spanish Netherlands required him to first defeat the Republic, and began planning the [[Franco-Dutch War]].{{sfn|Lynn|1996|pp=109-110}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|editor-last1=Afflerbach |editor-first1=Holger |editor-last2=Strachan |editor-first2=Hew |title=How Fighting Ends: A History of Surrender| date=2012|publisher=OUP|isbn=978-0199693627|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719089964|ref=harv|edition=2013}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Clodfelter |first1=Micheal (sic) |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1494-2007 |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-0786433193 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Davenport|editor1-first=Frances Gardiner|editor2-last=Paullin|editor2-first=Charles Oscar|title=European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United States and Its Dependencies, Vol. 2: 1650-1697|date=1917|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-0483158924|edition=2018|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=De P\u00e9rini |first1=Hard\u00ff |title=Batailles fran\u00e7aises, 1660-1700, Volume IV|date=1896 |publisher=Ernest Flammarion, Paris |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=El servicio de armas aragon\u00e9s durante el reinado de Carlos II: la defensa de Catalu\u00f1a, 1665-1697|journal=Revista de historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita|volume=72|year=1997|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Espino L\u00f3pez|first=Antonio|title=es Catalu\u00f1a durante el reinado de Carlos II : pol\u00edtica y guerra en la frontera catalana, 1679-1697]|year=1999|publisher=Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Margaret Anne|last2=Savelle|first2=Max|title=The origins of American diplomacy: the international history of Angloamerica, 1492-1763 American diplomatic history series Authors|date=1967|publisher=Macmillan|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Geyl |first1=P |title=Johan de Witt, Grand Pensionary of Holland, 1653\u201372 |journal=History |date=1936 |volume=20 |issue=80|ref=harv |jstor=24401084}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Goldie |first1=M |last2=Levillain|first2= Charles-Edouard |title=Francois-Paul de Lisola and English Opposition to Louis XIV |journal=Historical Journal |date=2018 |ref=harv |doi=10.17863/CAM.35128}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gooskens |first1=Frans |title=Sweden and the Treaty of Breda in 1667 \u2013 Swedish diplomats help to end naval warfare between the Dutch Republic and England |date=2016 |publisher=De Oranje-boom; Historical and Archeology Circle of the City and Country of Breda |url=https://sjohistoriskasamfundet.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/forum-navale-74-frans-gooskens.pdf|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Harline |first1=Craig |title=Herbert H.

The name derives from an obscure law known as the ''Jus Devolutionis'', used by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] to claim they 'devolved' to him by right of marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].\n\nThe French encountered minimal resistance, but Louis was more concerned to assert his inheritance rights in the Spanish Empire, and returned much of his gains in the May 1668 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. The terms were agreed by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] in January 1668, reinforced by the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe conflict marked the end of the long-standing Franco-Dutch alliance, and was the first of the French wars of expansion that dominated Europe for the next 50 years.\n\n==Background==\nAs part of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] that ended the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|Franco-Spanish War]], [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] married [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Despite being weakened by nearly a century of conflict, the [[Spanish Empire]] remained a huge global confederation. To prevent its acquisition by [[Kingdom of France|France]], Maria Theresa renounced her inheritance rights; in return, Louis was promised a dowry of 500,000 gold [[French \u00e9cu|\u00e9cus]], a huge sum that was never paid.{{sfn|Wolf|1968|p=117}}\n\nWhen [[Cardinal Mazarin]] died in 1661, Louis took control of the state and initiated an expansionist policy.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=6}} [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], his Finance Minister, argued French economic growth required the [[Spanish Netherlands]], implying conflict with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], a long-term French ally. The 1648 [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] that confirmed Dutch independence also gave [[Amsterdam]] control of trade through North-West Europe, by permanently closing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. Retaining this monopoly was a Dutch priority.{{sfn|Israel|1990|pp=197-199}}\n\nBy 1663, Louis concluded the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] would never voluntarily agree to his demands and began plans to seize the Spanish Netherlands, although negotiations continued to avoid raising suspicions.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=3}} As required by the 1662 Franco-Dutch Treaty of Paris, France entered the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in July 1665, providing an excuse for their military build up; Louis also calculated this made it harder for the Dutch to oppose him.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=298}} In September, Philip died, leaving his four year old son [[Charles II of Spain|Charles]] as king, and his widow [[Mariana of Austria]] as regent.

On this basis, he claimed most of the Spanish Netherlands, including [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], the towns of [[Cambrai]], Antwerp and [[Mechelen]], [[Upper Guelders]], the counties of [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and related possessions.{{sfn|Wolf|1962|p=316}} It was dismissed by Leopold and Mariana, since it applied only in Brabant, Namur and Hainault and concerned private property, not feudal rights but gave Louis a legal justification.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=33-34}}\n\nAware of French intentions, Mariana's government sought to end the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], agree an alliance with England, and break the Franco-Dutch relationship. Louis countered with the 1667 [[Treaty of Lisbon (1667)|Treaty of Lisbon]], a ten year alliance with Portugal, and paid potential opponents like [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] to remain neutral.{{sfn|Lynn|1996|p=36}} Leopold was occupied with the [[Great Turkish War]], while Foreign Minister [[Hugues de Lionne]] also extended the anti-Austrian [[League of the Rhine]] until 1668.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=95-96}}\n\nOn 8 May, every French ambassador in Europe read out a declaration, claiming Louis was taking possession of lands that rightfully belonged to him. In mid-May, talks to end the Anglo-Dutch War opened in [[Breda]] between the Republic, [[Denmark-Norway]], France and England; shortly before, [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] learned Louis and Charles had secretly agreed terms in advance, increasing the pressure on the Dutch not to oppose French aims.{{sfn|Gooskens|2016|p=69}}\n\nThe imminence of war ended Spain's reluctance to accept Portuguese sovereignty; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Madrid (1667)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed on 23 May, granted England substantial commercial privileges, in return for help in ending the war with Portugal.{{sfn|Fisher|Savelle|1967|pp=66-70}}\n\n==War==\n===May to September 1667; the Spanish Netherlands===\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = The Spanish Netherlands, 1667 campaign; note modern Franco-Belgian boundary, blue lines indicate rivers|relief=yes|border = black| width = 300| float = right\n|label = Oudenaarde|pos=right  |lat_deg=50|lat_min =51|lon_deg = 3|lon_min = 36\n|label3 =Antwerp |pos3= top|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 13|lon3_deg = 4|lon3_min = 24\n|label4 =Tournai |pos4=right|lat4_deg=50|lat4_min = 36|lon4_deg = 3|lon4_min = 23\n|label5= Charleroi|pos5=bottom|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min = 24|lon5_deg = 4|lon5_min = 26\n|label6 = Lille  |pos6=left|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =38 |lon6_deg = 3 |lon6_min = 03\n|label7= Namur|pos7 = right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 28| lon7_deg = 4|lon7_min = 52\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9 = M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 49 | lat9_min =46 | lon9_deg =4 | lon9_min = 43\n|label10 = Sierck|pos10 = bottom|lat10_deg = 49 | lat10_min =26 | lon10_deg =6 | lon10_min = 21\n|label11 = Kortrijk|pos11 = left|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min=50|lon11_deg =3 | lon11_min = 16\n|label12 = Brussels|pos12 = right|lat12_deg=50|lat12_min=41|lon12_deg =4 | lon12_min = 21\n|label13 = Dendermonde|pos13 = left|lat13_deg=51|lat13_min=02|lon13_deg =4 | lon13_min = 06\n|label14 = Aalst|pos14 = right|lat14_deg=50|lat14_min=56|lon14_deg =4 |lon14_min = 02\n}}\nAlso referred to as [[Flanders]], the Spanish Netherlands was a compact area, dominated by canals and rivers.

Another 9,000 under [[Aumont family|Antoine de Rochebaron]] prepared to advance up the Lys, via [[Kortrijk]] and [[Oudenaarde]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cr\u00e9quy|de Cr\u00e9quy]] and 6,000 light cavalry were based at [[Sierck-les-Bains]], securing their flank against an attack from Germany.

Despite spending the enormous sum of 1.5 million [[escudos]] on her daughter's wedding, Mariana managed to increase the forces available to him from 11,000 in mid 1666 to 27,000 by April 1667.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=34-36}}\n\nAlthough insufficient to defend every position, the Spanish did not need to do so. Given time, it was accepted even the strongest fortifications would fall and their primary purpose was to delay, while the defenders mobilised reserves or found a diplomatic solution. Capturing towns was relatively easy, holding them far harder, since every garrison weakened the field army; over the next century, the French confronted this strategic dilemma time and again in this theatre.{{sfn|Afflerbach|Strachan|2012|p=159}}\n[[File:Diksmuide - Polders - IJzer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Yser]] river, in [[Plain of Flanders|Maritime Flanders]]; a good example of the geography in this area]]\nTurenne's first objective was [[Charleroi]], a key Spanish supply base; Castel Rodrigo could not hold it and withdrew to [[Brussels]], first destroying its fortifications. On 2 June, [[Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal|De Montal]] was appointed French governor and given a garrison of 3,000, while [[Vauban]] began rebuilding its defences. By the end of July, Rochebaron had captured [[Tournai]], Kortrijk and Oudenaarde; Turenne advanced on [[Dendermonde]], intending to take Antwerp.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=301}}\n\nOn 31 July, peace treaties were signed at Breda and the Dutch began discussions with England and Spain on creating a diplomatic alliance against France. At the same time, Castel Rodrigo opened the water defences, flooding the land and bringing the French advance to a halt.

Ordered to cut off his retreat, [[Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds|Bellefonds]] and de Cr\u00e9quy inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties; in early 1668, Louis created both [[List of Marshals of France#Louis XIV, 1643\u20131715|Marshals of France]].{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=303}} On 12 September, Turenne captured [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]] but although his troops suffered relatively few battle casualties, sickness was a far bigger problem; in early October, campaigning ended for the winter.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=304}}\n\n===Negotiations; winter 1667/1668===\n[[File:Johan de Witt 1652.jpg|thumb|right|[[Johan de Witt]], Dutch [[Grand Pensionary]]; he had to persuade Louis to withdraw, while keeping him as an ally]]\nOn 31 July 1667, the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the Anglo-Dutch War and negotiations began on a common front against France.{{sfn|Geyl|1936|pp=311}} This was driven by the [[States of Zeeland]], supported by [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|Sir William Temple]], English ambassador in [[the Hague]] and [[Brussels]], and Francois-Paul de Lisola, Leopold's representative in London.{{sfn|Goldie|Levillain|2018|p=5}}\n\nDe Witt summarised the Dutch dilemma as follows; 'to abandon Spain is to make France a present of the Netherlands, to take on her defence alone is folly.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=111}} Although he and Charles preferred France, the vast majority of their countrymen did not, which meant they had to satisfy domestic opinion by making Louis retreat, but remain friends. According to the French [[Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne|ambassador in Sweden]], Charles quickly recognised this was almost impossible, and focused on ensuring Louis blamed De Witt.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=6}}\n\nFrom April 1667 to June 1668, Franco-Dutch trade declined by 30%, due to the imposition of French tariffs.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=155}} Combined with the prospect of France as a neighbour, this led to widespread support for an Anglo-Dutch alliance among [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangists]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and the general populace.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=7}} In England, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[City of London Corporation|business]] wanted peace, while most preferred Spain for strategic and commercial reasons, including chief minister [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]]; an Anglo-Dutch alliance in support of Spain seemed the ideal solution. Finally, it allowed Charles to keep Parliament happy, while demonstrating Dutch unreliability and thus increasing the price Louis would pay for his support in the [[Secret Treaty of Dover|1670 Treaty of Dover]].{{sfn|Hutton|1986|pp=299-300}} \n\nIn September, De Witt promised to ensure Spain accepted French terms for ending the war, but Louis insisted he commit to enforcing them if needed. When Mariana refused, he persuaded the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] to pass resolutions on 10 December and 14 January 1668, approving military action against Spain. This was strongly resisted by the other provinces, and the Orangist opposition in Holland.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=4}}\n[[File:Louis-xiv-lebrunl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], ca 1661]]\nWhen Philip died in 1665, Spain's only ally was Leopold; by 1668, their diplomats had built relationships with the Orangists, England, and traditional French supporters like Sweden and Brandenburg. In September 1667, [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] was deposed by his brother [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro]], who opened discussions on ending the Restoration war.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|p=47}} The 1667 agreement with France was annulled and on 13 February 1668, Spain recognised Portuguese independence with the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Newitt|2004|p=228}}\n\nTo fund the 1668 campaign, Castel-Rodrigo agreed a loan of 2 million guilders from the Amsterdam financial markets; as security, the Dutch would be allowed to occupy Bruges, Ostend and Damme. The prospect of peace with Portugal meant Mariana could reject these conditions; she sent Castel-Rodrigo [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]] for 600,000 escudos and one million bars of silver. This allowed him to begin recruiting, while Brandenburg agreed to supply 12,000 troops.{{sfn|Mitchell|2019|pp=50-52}}\n\nOn 20 January, Louis and Leopold signed a Partition Treaty, agreeing the division of the Spanish Empire if Charles of Spain died; this included the terms given to De Witt in September.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=144,152}} The [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] was signed by England and the Republic on 23 January, the third member, [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], formally joining on 5 May, three days after Aix-la-Chapelle.{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=166}} It contained a pact of mutual defence, an agreement to ensure Spain accepted French terms, and secret clauses, including military action against France if Louis reneged on this promise.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|pp=8-10}}\n\nRuvigny, French ambassador in London, received a copy within days, allegedly from Arlington, which he passed onto Lionne.{{sfn|Rowen|1954|p=12}} Writing ten years later, largely to justify the subsequent [[Franco-Dutch War]], Louis claimed it was a calculated insult by the 'ungrateful Dutch nation', but his reaction at the time was far more moderate.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=23}} The French recognised the military clause was largely unenforceable; as Turenne observed, 'the Dutch have more ill-will than power, the English neither troops or money'.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=26}} Lionne also pointed out the Alliance's guarantee applied to both sides, obliging Spain to comply with French terms 'without it costing us a sou.'{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=156}}\n\n===February 1668; the campaign in Franche-Comt\u00e9===\n{{Location map many|France Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9|caption = Modern department of Bourgogne (left) and Franche-Comt\u00e9 (right); key locations 1668 campaign |border = black|width =300|float = right|relief=yes|\n|label  = Besan\u00e7on   |pos = right|lat_deg =47|lat_min  = 14|lon_deg  = 6|lon_min = 1\n|label2 = Dole       |pos2 = right |lat2_deg=47|lat2_min = 05|lon2_deg = 5|lon2_min = 30\n|label3 = Gray       |pos3 = right |lat3_deg=47|lat3_min  =27|lon3_deg = 5|lon3_min = 36\n|label4 = Vesoul     |pos4 = right|lat4_deg=47|lat4_min  =37|lon4_deg = 6|lon4_min = 10\n|label5 = Salins-les-Bains|pos5 = bottom|lat5_deg  =46|lat5_min  =57|lon5_deg  = 5|lon5_min = 53\n|label6  = Dijon     |pos6 = top |lat6_deg  =47|lat6_min=19|lon6_deg = 5|lon6_min = 01\n|label7  = Nevers    |pos7 = right  |lat7_deg  =47|lat7_min=00|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 10\n|label8  = Auxonne   |pos8 = left   |lat8_deg  =47|lat8_min  =12|lon8_deg  = 5|lon8_min = 23\n}}\nThroughout his career, Louis sought to improve his position prior to negotiations; in September, he decided to occupy [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. It was almost impossible for Spain to defend, while its governor, the Marquis de Yenne, had fewer than 2,000 men to hold the entire province.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} French armies also benefitted from vastly superior logistics, allowing them to open campaigns before their opponents were ready. The invasion was planned for early February, normally considered impractical for troop movements, adding the factor of surprise to superior numbers.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|p=112}}\n\nThe operation was commanded by the [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Prince de Cond\u00e9]]. Once France's leading general, he fought against Louis during the 1648 to 1653 [[Fronde]], then with Spain until 1659; this was his first command since returning from exile in 1660. Franche-Comt\u00e9 was considered part of [[Burgundy]], his family's traditional power base and his selection demonstrated royal control over an area with a long history as an independent state.{{sfn|Swann|2003|p=44}}\n\nTo keep his opponents guessing, Louis announced plans to double the army to 134,000 and leaked details of a proposed 1668 campaign. Led by himself and Turenne, 66,000 men would complete the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands; a subsidiary force under [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans]] would attack [[Catalonia]], with Cond\u00e9 in the [[Three Bishoprics]] to deter an attack from Germany.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|pp=20-21}}\n\nThis provided cover for assembling troops and supplies in [[Dijon]]; by early February, Cond\u00e9 had 12,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry concentrated near [[Auxonne]]. He divided the army into two columns, the other led by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and entered Franche-Comt\u00e9 on 4 February.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=305}} [[Free City of Besan\u00e7on|Besan\u00e7on]] and [[Salins-les-Bains]] surrendered on 7 February, after which Cond\u00e9 and Luxembourg moved onto [[Dole, Jura|Dole]], where they were joined by Louis on 9 February. His presence resulted in a largely unnecessary assault, which cost the French between 400 to 500 casualties, their only significant losses of the campaign. Dole surrendered on 14 February, followed by the provincial capital of [[Gray, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne|Gray]] on 19th; Louis was back in [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]] on 24th.{{sfn|De P\u00e9rini|1896|p=306}}\n\n===May 1668; Northern Catalonia===\nOn the southern front, the Spanish took the initiative; the [[Gaspar T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 5th Duke de Osuna|Duke of Osuna]], [[Viceroy of Catalonia]], invaded the [[Upper Cerdanya]] with 2,300 infantry and 200 cavalry.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1997|p=9}} Weak French defences allowed him to capture 55 villages in the region, although irregular local ''[[miquelets]]'' combined with the French military in resisting the invasion.{{sfn|Espino L\u00f3pez|1999|p=266}} Spanish incursions continued until 1669, forcing the French to fortify the border.{{sfn|Jan\u00e9 Checa|2003|p=454}}\n\n===Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle===\nWith the largest army in Europe, Turenne, Cond\u00e9 and Orl\u00e9ans argued for continuing the war. Lionne, Colbert and Le Tellier recommended peace, primarily on financial grounds; the 1660s was a period of significant economic decline, and war was expensive. France was unprepared for a naval war against the Dutch and English, and while Colbert had initiated policies aimed at reducing its dependence on Dutch shipping for transporting goods, this would take time.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=153-154}} In addition to those already contracted with Brandenburg, [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] offered Mariana another 8,000 men. {{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=163}}\n\nIn February, seven year old Charles was reported to be suffering from [[smallpox]], an often fatal disease; his death would give Louis a good chance of achieving his objectives without fighting. The combination decided him on peace; on 25 April, the Treaty of Saint Germain, between France, England and the Republic, finalised terms, which were then incorporated into the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], signed by Spain and France on 2 May.{{sfn|Lesaffer}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Map Peace of Aix la Chapelle (English).png|thumb|left|French gains by Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: Louis returned [[Cambrai]], [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] and [[Saint-Omer]], but retained the rest]]\nFrance withdrew from Franche-Comt\u00e9 and the Spanish Netherlands, with the exception of eleven towns and their surrounding areas. Lille, [[Armenti\u00e8res]], [[Bergues]] and [[Douai]] were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day. The retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, [[Veurne]], [[Binche]], Charleroi and [[Ath]] made future offensives much easier, as demonstrated in 1672.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|p=165}}\n\nFrom a military perspective, France strengthened its northern border, and [[S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] began work on the defence line that became known as the ''Ceinture de fer''. Possession of towns like Charleroi and Tournai facilitated future campaigns through the control of vital routes into the Spanish Netherlands, but they were easily isolated and required expensive garrisons.{{sfn|Sonino|1989|p=31}}\n\nThe political results were mixed; in the Partition Treaty, Leopold recognised Louis' right to inherit part of the Spanish Empire, much to the anger of Spain. However, Louis' expansionist ambitions sparked discussions on an anti-French coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|1689 Grand Alliance]].{{sfn|Young|2004|p=220}}\n\nThe role of the Triple Alliance in the peace is debated by modern historians, including [[Herbert H. Rowen|Herbert Rowen]], \"arguably the most important English-speaking historian of the Dutch Republic since [[John Lothrop Motley]]\".{{sfn|Harline |1999}} Its real significance was aligning English and Dutch objectives, despite the brief interruption in 1672 of the deeply unpopular [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]; the Dutch viewed Aix-la-Chapelle as a diplomatic triumph.{{sfn|Macintosh|1973|pp=163-167}}\n\nConcern over French ambitions also revived the Orangist party, increasing internal political conflict with De Witt's Republican faction.

Later installments of the game and other works in the franchise (e.g., films) saw the release of still more biological weapons over time, created mainly by the fictional Umbrella Corporation and various other organizations. The viruses are also often engineered to radically mutate the subjects into grotesque killing machines, referred to in-universe as B.O.W.s, short for bio-organic weapon.\n* In ''[[Command & Conquer: Generals]]'' (2003), the Global Liberation Army (GLA) makes extensive use of biological weapons and has a general who specializes in bio and chemical warfare named Dr. Thrax. The GLA units such as the toxin tractor and toxin rebels spray toxins on enemy units and later use anthrax beta, a weaponized strain of anthrax. Anthrax beta is also used in [[Scud]] missiles and the air dropped anthrax bomb. Dr. Thrax's troops have access to the more potent anthrax gamma strain.\n* In ''[[Act of War: Direct Action]]'' (2005) and its expansion the Consortium, a syndicate of corporations, PMCs and terrorists use a modified strain of Ebola known as Ebola II [[hemorrhagic fever]] strain causing the infected soldiers to lose health and die.

The game features multiple real pathogen types and fictional pathogen types, all with unique abilities and mechanics.\n* During the campaign in ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' (2014), Atlas CEO Johnathon Irons develops a bioweapon called Manticore, designed to attack all the population that is not in the Atlas database. Irons deployed the weapon late in the campaign, killing most of the Sentinel soldiers in [[New Baghdad]] planning to attack him.\n* In ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division]]'' (2016), an eco-terrorist unleashed a heavily modified variant of smallpox in New York City, in a bid to kill a large portion of the population. The spread of the disease spiraled out of control, resulting in the complete breakdown of law and order and a rise of hostile factions in the city, mostly on [[Manhattan]] Island, which was ground zero of the virus.\n* In the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' franchise, the genophage is an agent that genetically modified the Krogans to stop their aggressive expansion into Citadel Space. The agent made it difficult for Krogans to conceive children, however. Even when conceived, most Krogan pregnancies henceforth resulted in stillbirth.\n* In the ''[[Metroid]]'' series, the Chozo race creates the [[Metroid (fictional species)|Metroid]] to combat the X Parasite on SR388. The Space Pirates try to capture and breed Metroids and use them as bioweapons, but their plans are foiled by [[Samus Aran]] several times: once in ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986), in ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' (2002) and another time in ''[[Super Metroid]]'' (1994).

(Forced Evolutionary Virus) was created by the US government in an effort to protect their soldiers from biological weapons deployed by the Chinese military that were ravaging civilian populations. The results of this Pan-Immunity Virion Project was the FEV, a virus that provides immunity to human pathogens, near-immunity to radiation, increases strength and intelligence (in unmutated humans, humans with mutations from radiation or substrains of FEV lose intelligence upon infection), while simultaneously sterilizing the host and eliminating secondary sexual characteristics, making them all outwardly male in appearance. FEV has unpredictable effects on other animals and it is a partial contributor to the mutated beasts you encounter throughout the wasteland. There is also the US developed New Plague (a.k.a Blue Flu). Code-named Limit 115, it was developed by the US government in secret as a sterilization agent for use against the Chinese (people who survived the deadly virus were usually rendered sterile), Chinese agents managed to get their hands on it however and it was accidentally released during their escape causing a national outbreak in the heart of the US. The symptoms are generally flu like at first with hemorrhagic-fever like features in the late-stage. It usually took 3\u20135 days from onset of symptoms to death.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weapons of mass destruction in popular culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Biological weapons in popular culture| ]]\n[[Category:Conflict in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Genetic engineering in fiction]]\n[[Category:War in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Weapons in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Weapons of mass destruction in fiction]]\n[[Category:Works about violence]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[Biological warfare]]''' (BW)\u2014also known as '''bacteriological warfare''', or '''germ warfare'''\u2014has had a presence in popular culture for over 100 years.
