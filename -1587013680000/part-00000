The SR-22 Rifle uses standard 10/22 rotary magazines, in addition to most aftermarket 10/22 magazines.<ref>{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_56/ai_n56225074/|title=Ruger fields their own .22 LR AR: the old favorite 10/22 serves well as the platform|work=Guns Magazine|date=March 2010|author=Holt Bodinson}}</ref> The positions of the magazine release, the safety and the charging handle are all more similar to a standard 10/22 than an AR-15. The SR-22 Rifle competes directly with other AR-15 style rimfire rifles such as those made by [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]. The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail. Threaded holes on the handguard provide the customization of optional attachment rails.\n\n===22 Charger Pistol===\n[[File:Ruger Charger with Swift pistol scope.jpg|thumb|Ruger Charger. Comes with bipod. Shown with aftermarket TruGlow multi-color reflexive dot scope and Ruger BX-25 extended magazine.]]\n\nThe ''22 Charger'' pistol, first introduced in late 2007, is a [[pistol]] based on the 10/22 action. The 22 Charger originally came with a black laminated wood pistol stock with forend, a {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} matte blued heavy barrel, a [[bipod]], and a [[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] style scope base in lieu of iron sights. Overall length is just under {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=out}}, making it quite large for a handgun. As it has an included bipod it is likely to be used from a shooting bench or table. The bipod attaches to a sling swivel on the stock fore-end and is easily removable. Due to technical features, such as the magazine being outside the pistol grip, the Charger is not legally available in some U.S. states. The 22 Charger was later discontinued.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruger.com/Charger/Specifications.html |title=.22 Charger Pistol |accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gunblast.com/Ruger-22Charger.htm |title=Ruger\u2019s New .22 Charger Semi-Auto Pistol}}</ref> It was reintroduced in December 2014, with a brown laminate stock with a M16A2 style pistol grip, 10-inch threaded barrel, picatinny rail, 15-round magazine and adjustable bipod. At the same time a \"Takedown\" model was introduced with a green laminate stock. Both models were later offered from September 2015 with black polymer stocks.\n\n=== 50th Anniversary Rifle ===\nIn 2014 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Ruger 10/22 a contest was held to design an anniversary model. The winning design by public vote has a stainless steel 18.5\" threaded barrel with flash suppressor, a lightweight black synthetic stock with interchangeable stock modules, a picatinny rail and ghost-ring adjustable rear sight.\n\n=== Collector's Series ===\nA limited edition 50th Anniversary Collector's Series Carbine model was offered in 2014. It had a black alloy receiver with \"1964-2014\" special markings, 18.5\" barrel, fiber optic sights, and a 25-round magazine.\n\n=== Collector's Series Second Edition ===\nIn June 2015, Ruger announced a limited Second Edition of the Collector's Series 10/22 carbine.

The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round polymer [[rotary magazine]], the '''BX-1'''.  Ruger has also introduced a transparent [[polycarbonate]] version (\"40th-anniversary edition\") of the BX-1 called the '''BX-1CLR''', as well as a 1-round version for training and a 5-round version for states or countries that restrict magazine capacities.  In 2011\u20132012, Ruger came out with the '''BX-25''', a curved 25-round [[box magazine]] with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round '''BX-15''' box magazine for states that restrict magazine capacities.  Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round [[drum magazine]]s.\n\nThe standard BX-1 rotary magazine stores the cartridges in a [[cogwheel]]-like holder, rather than stacked as seen in a box magazine.  This allows the magazine to be very compact and fit flush into the rifle without protruding from the stock at the natural balance point for one-handed carry.  The [[bolt (firearm)|bolt]] of the rifle pushes a cartridge from the metal feeding lip of the magazine with each shot, allowing the next cartridge to feed into place.  Due to its time-tested reliability, the rotary magazine is also used by the Ruger's [[Ruger American Rifle#Ruger American Rimfire|American Rimfire]] series [[bolt-action rifle]]s, as well as the 10/22-footprinted \"Summit\" toggle-action rifles produced by Primary Weapon Systems/Vorquartsen.  Even Ruger's market competitor [[Savage Arms]] has recently adopted a detachable rotary magazine design similar to the BX-1 in its new A series (semi-automatic) and B series (bolt-action) rimfire rifles.\n\nNot all Ruger 10/22 magazines are interchangeable.  The owners manual for the 10/22 Magnum model states, \"Do not attempt to use standard 10/22 magazines in the 10/22 Magnum rifles or load [[.22 Short]], [[.22 Long|Long]], or Long Rifle ammunition into the [[.22 Magnum]].  They will not function correctly and are unsafe to use in .22 Magnum rifles.\"  It goes on to say, \"Never attempt to use .22 Long Rifle ammunition in Ruger 10/22 Magnum rifle magazines.  The cartridges have a smaller case diameter and can split or burst when fired in the larger magnum chamber, releasing hot powder gasses and particle fragments out of the action at high speed, possibly resulting in injury to the shooter or bystanders.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Instruction Manual for Ruger\u00ae 10/22\u00ae Autoloading Rifles|date=2015|publisher=Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc|location=Newport, New Hampshire|url=http://ruger-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_manuals/1022.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Intratec TEC-22]], a pistol that feeds from 10/22 magazines.\n\n{{clear right}}\u2022 Tips and tricks:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The pins holding the trigger assembly can be   replaced with larger pins measuring 4.8x31.8mm (metric)\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> the pin holding the mag release, and the pi  holding the bolt release and ejector can be replaced by larger pins measuring 3.2mm \n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Ruger 10/22}}\n* [http://www.ruger.com/products/1022/overview.html Official website]\n\n{{Ruger}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ruger 10 22}}\n[[Category:.22 LR semi-automatic rifles]]\n[[Category:Ruger rifles|10 22]]\n[[Category:Rotary magazine firearms]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|10/22|the date|October 22}}\n\n{{Infobox weapon\n|name=Ruger 10/22\n| image= Ruger 10-22.jpg\n| image_size = 320\n|caption= Ruger 10/22\n|origin= United States\n|type= Rimfire semi-automatic rifle\n|is_ranged= yes\n|designer= [[William B.

The SR-22 Rifle uses standard 10/22 rotary magazines, in addition to most aftermarket 10/22 magazines.<ref>{{citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_56/ai_n56225074/|title=Ruger fields their own .22 LR AR: the old favorite 10/22 serves well as the platform|work=Guns Magazine|date=March 2010|author=Holt Bodinson}}</ref> The positions of the magazine release, the safety and the charging handle are all more similar to a standard 10/22 than an AR-15. The SR-22 Rifle competes directly with other AR-15 style rimfire rifles such as those made by [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] and [[Smith & Wesson]]. The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail. Threaded holes on the handguard provide the customization of optional attachment rails.\n\n===22 Charger Pistol===\n[[File:Ruger Charger with Swift pistol scope.jpg|thumb|Ruger Charger. Comes with bipod. Shown with aftermarket TruGlow multi-color reflexive dot scope and Ruger BX-25 extended magazine.]]\n\nThe ''22 Charger'' pistol, first introduced in late 2007, is a [[pistol]] based on the 10/22 action. The 22 Charger originally came with a black laminated wood pistol stock with forend, a {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} matte blued heavy barrel, a [[bipod]], and a [[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] style scope base in lieu of iron sights. Overall length is just under {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=out}}, making it quite large for a handgun. As it has an included bipod it is likely to be used from a shooting bench or table. The bipod attaches to a sling swivel on the stock fore-end and is easily removable. Due to technical features, such as the magazine being outside the pistol grip, the Charger is not legally available in some U.S. states. The 22 Charger was later discontinued.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ruger.com/Charger/Specifications.html |title=.22 Charger Pistol |accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gunblast.com/Ruger-22Charger.htm |title=Ruger\u2019s New .22 Charger Semi-Auto Pistol}}</ref> It was reintroduced in December 2014, with a brown laminate stock with a M16A2 style pistol grip, 10-inch threaded barrel, picatinny rail, 15-round magazine and adjustable bipod. At the same time a \"Takedown\" model was introduced with a green laminate stock. Both models were later offered from September 2015 with black polymer stocks.\n\n=== 50th Anniversary Rifle ===\nIn 2014 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Ruger 10/22 a contest was held to design an anniversary model. The winning design by public vote has a stainless steel 18.5\" threaded barrel with flash suppressor, a lightweight black synthetic stock with interchangeable stock modules, a picatinny rail and ghost-ring adjustable rear sight.\n\n=== Collector's Series ===\nA limited edition 50th Anniversary Collector's Series carbine model was offered in 2014. It had a black alloy receiver with \"1964-2014\" special markings, 18.5\" barrel, fiber optic sights and a 25-round magazine.\n\n=== Collector's Series Second Edition ===\nIn June 2015, Ruger announced a limited Second Edition of the Collector's Series 10/22 carbine. It features a dark grey version of Ruger's Modular Stock System found on the Ruger American Rimfire rifle, a protected non-glare blade front sight, ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight, and a Picatinny rail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruger.com/news/2015-06-19.html|title=Ruger News|last=|first=|date=June 19, 2015|website=Ruger Firearms|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===VLEH Target Tactical Rifle===\nIn 2009 Ruger also announced the ''Target Tactical Rifle'' model, a hybrid of the 10/22T and [[Ruger M77|Ruger M77 Hawkeye Tactical rifle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/10/06/new-ruger-1022-vleh-target-tactical-rifle/ |title=New Ruger 10/22 VLEH Target Tactical Rifle}}</ref>\n\n* '''V''' - ''Varmint'' barrel, '''L''' - ''Law'' + '''E''' - ''Enforcement'' model, '''H''' - ''Hogue'' stock.\n\n==Modifications==\n[[File:Unmodified and modified Ruger 10 22 rifles.jpg|thumb|right|Standard Ruger 10/22 Carbine, and a highly modified Ruger 10/22]]\n\nThe image on the bottom right shows two 10/22 carbines, the top one in issued form (with a 4-power magnification scope added, using the factory supplied scope base) and the bottom one in highly modified form.

The barrel length is 16.5\" with an overall weapon length of 34{{frac|1|2}}\" and the weight is 6&nbsp;lbs.

The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round polymer [[rotary magazine]], the '''BX-1'''.  Ruger has also introduced a transparent [[polycarbonate]] version (\"40th-anniversary edition\") of the BX-1 called the '''BX-1CLR''', as well as a 1-round version for training and a 5-round version for states or countries that restrict magazine capacities.  In 2011\u20132012, Ruger came out with the '''BX-25''', a curved 25-round [[box magazine]] with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round '''BX-15''' box magazine for states that restrict magazine capacities.  Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round [[drum magazine]]s.\n\nThe standard BX-1 rotary magazine stores the cartridges in a [[cogwheel]]-like holder, rather than stacked as seen in a box magazine.  This allows the magazine to be very compact and fit flush into the rifle without protruding from the stock at the natural balance point for one-handed carry.  The [[bolt (firearm)|bolt]] of the rifle pushes a cartridge from the metal feeding lip of the magazine with each shot, allowing the next cartridge to feed into place.  Due to its time-tested reliability, the rotary magazine is also used by the Ruger's [[Ruger American Rifle#Ruger American Rimfire|American Rimfire]] series [[bolt-action rifle]]s, as well as the 10/22-footprinted \"Summit\" toggle-action rifles produced by Primary Weapon Systems/Vorquartsen.  Even Ruger's market competitor [[Savage Arms]] has recently adopted a detachable rotary magazine design similar to the BX-1 in its new A series (semi-automatic) and B series (bolt-action) rimfire rifles.\n\nNot all Ruger 10/22 magazines are interchangeable.  The owners manual for the 10/22 Magnum model states, \"Do not attempt to use standard 10/22 magazines in the 10/22 Magnum rifles or load [[.22 Short]], [[.22 Long|Long]], or Long Rifle ammunition into the [[.22 Magnum]].  They will not function correctly and are unsafe to use in .22 Magnum rifles.\"  It goes on to say, \"Never attempt to use .22 Long Rifle ammunition in Ruger 10/22 Magnum rifle magazines.  The cartridges have a smaller case diameter and can split or burst when fired in the larger magnum chamber, releasing hot powder gasses and particle fragments out of the action at high speed, possibly resulting in injury to the shooter or bystanders.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Instruction Manual for Ruger\u00ae 10/22\u00ae Autoloading Rifles|date=2015|publisher=Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc|location=Newport, New Hampshire|url=http://ruger-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_manuals/1022.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Intratec TEC-22]], a pistol that feeds from 10/22 magazines.\n\n{{clear right}}\u2022 Tips and tricks:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The pins holding the trigger assembly can be   replaced with larger pins measuring 4.8x31.8mm (metric)\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> the pin holding the mag release, and the pi  holding the bolt release and ejector can be replaced by larger pins measuring 3.2mm \n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Ruger 10/22}}\n* [http://www.ruger.com/products/1022/overview.html Official website]\n\n{{Ruger}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ruger 10 22}}\n[[Category:.22 LR semi-automatic rifles]]\n[[Category:Ruger rifles|10 22]]\n[[Category:Rotary magazine firearms]]\n", "name_user": "Skye.nel", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruger_10/22"}
