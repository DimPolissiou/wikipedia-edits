{"title_page": "Wine fault", "text_new": "A '''wine fault''' or '''defect''' is an unpleasant characteristic of a [[wine]] often resulting from poor [[winemaking]] practices or [[storage conditions (wine)|storage conditions]], and leading to '''wine spoilage'''. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to be of issue. In fact, depending on [[perception]], these concentrations may impart positive characters to the wine. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the [[sensory threshold]], they replace or obscure the [[flavor]]s and [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable.<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\">M.

Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor [[storage of the wine]] that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty [[stemware]] during [[wine tasting]] that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\"/><ref name=\"Bird pg 31-82, et al\">D. Bird ''\"Understanding Wine Technology\"'' pg 31-82, 155-184, 202-222 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between flaws and faults==\nIn wine tasting, there is a big distinction made between what is considered a ''flaw'' and a ''fault''. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive [[sulfur dioxide]], [[volatile acidity]], ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' or \"Brett aromas\" and [[diacetyl]] or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and [[recognition threshold]] of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and ''Brettanomyces'' can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include [[acetaldehyde]] (except when purposely induced in wines like [[Sherry]] and [[Rancio]]), [[ethyl acetate]] and [[cork taint]].<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\"/>\n\n==Detecting faults in wine tasting==\nThe vast majority of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and [[Browning in red wine|browning]] of the [[wine's color]]. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that are not meant to be [[sparkling (wine)|sparkling]] can be a sign of [[Fermentation (wine)|refermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]] happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive [[copper]], [[iron]] or [[proteins]] that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with [[volatile acidity]] that can make a wine seem out of balance.<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\"/><ref name=\"Bird pg 31-82, et al\"/>\n\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n||'''Wine fault'''\n||'''Characteristics'''\n|-\n| [[Acetaldehyde]]||Smell of roasted nuts or dried out straw.

[[Anthocyanin]]s, [[catechin]]s, epicatechins and other [[Phenolic content in wine|phenols]] present in wine are those most easily oxidised,<ref name=duToitW>duToit, W.J. (2005). [http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/200508oxygen.php3 Oxygen in winemaking: Part I]. WineLand. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.</ref> which leads to a loss of colour, flavour and aroma - sometimes referred to as ''flattening''. In most cases compounds such as [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[erythorbic acid]] are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their organoleptic effect.<ref name=goode>Goode, Jamie (05/16/05). [http://www.wineint.com/storyprint.asp?sc=1810 Oxidation (link is dead)]. Wine International. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.</ref> Apart from phenolic oxidation, the [[ethanol]] present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for flavour and aroma taints.\n\n[[File:Oxidation of ethanol.svg|center|thumb|500px|The oxidation of ethanol]]\n\n===Acetaldehyde===\n[[Acetaldehyde]] is an intermediate product of [[Yeast in winemaking|yeast]] [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]; however, it is more commonly associated with [[ethanol]] [[oxidation]] catalysed by the enzyme [[alcohol dehydrogenase|ethanol dehydrogenase]]. Acetaldehyde production is also associated with the presence of surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as [[acetic acid bacteria]], which form the compound by the [[decarboxylation]] of [[pyruvate]]. The [[sensory threshold]] for acetaldehyde is 100-125 [[Micrograms|mg]]/[[litre|L]]. Beyond this level it imparts a ''[[sherry]]'' type character to the wine which can also be described as ''green apple'', ''sour'' and ''metallic''. Acetaldehyde [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] is also implicated in [[hangover]]s.\n\n===Acetic acid===\n[[Acetic acid]] in wine, often referred to as volatile acidity (VA) or ''vinegar taint'', can be contributed by many wine spoilage [[yeasts]] and [[bacteria]]. This can be from either a [[by-product]] of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera ''[[Acetobacter]]'' and ''[[Gluconobacter]]'' produce high levels of acetic acid. The [[sensory threshold]] for acetic acid in wine is >700&nbsp;mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.\n\nThere are different opinions as to what level of volatile acidity is appropriate for higher quality wine. Although too high a concentration is sure to leave an undesirable, 'vinegar' tasting wine, some wine's acetic acid levels are developed to create a more 'complex', desirable taste.<ref>[http://www.wineint.com/story.asp?storyCode=1908 Volatile Acidity] - great article from [[Wine & Spirit]] mag</ref>  The renowned 1947 [[Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc|Cheval Blanc]] is widely recognized to contain high levels of volatile acidity.\n\n[[Ethyl acetate]] is formed in wine by the [[esterification]] of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels are more likely to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the volatile acidity. It is a common microbial fault produced by [[wine spoilage yeast]]s, particularly ''[[Pichia anomala]]'' or ''[[Kloeckera apiculata]]''. High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by [[lactic acid bacteria]] and [[acetic acid bacteria]].\n\n==Sulfur compounds==\n[[Sulfur]] is used as an [[food additive|additive]] throughout the winemaking process, primarily to stop oxidation as mentioned above but also as  [[antimicrobial]] agent. When managed properly in wine, its presence there is often undetected, however when used recklessly it can contribute to flavour and aroma taints which are very volatile and potent. Sulfur compounds typically have low sensory thresholds.\n\n===Sulfur dioxide===\n[[File:Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg|right|150px|Sulfur dioxide]]\n[[Sulfur dioxide]] is a common wine additive, used for its [[antioxidant]] and [[preservative]] properties. When its use is not managed well it can be overadded, with its perception in wine reminiscent of ''matchsticks'', ''burnt rubber'', or ''mothballs''. Wines such as these are often termed ''sulfitic''.\n\n===Hydrogen sulfide===\n[[File:Hydrogen-sulfide-2D-dimensions.svg|right|150px|Hydrogen sulfide]]\n[[Hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) is generally thought to be a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in [[Yeast assimilable nitrogen|nitrogen limited environments]]. It is formed when yeast ferments via the [[sulfate reduction pathway]]. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent H<sub>2</sub>S formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 \u03bcg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct ''rotten egg'' aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and [[disulfide]]s.\n\n===Mercaptans===\n[[File:Ethanethiol2.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[ethanethiol|ethyl mercaptan]]]]\n[[Mercaptans]] (thiols) are produced in wine by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with other wine components such as ethanol. They can be formed if finished wine is allowed prolonged contact with the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]]. This can be prevented by [[racking]] the wine. Mercaptans have a very low sensory threshold, around 1.5 [[Micrograms|\u03bcg]]/[[litre|L]],<ref name=ETS1>[http://www.etslabs.com/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=350 Technical Bulletin - Sulfides in Wine]. ETS Laboratories. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.</ref> with levels above causing ''onion'', ''rubber'', and ''skunk'' type odours. Note that dimethyl disulfide is formed from the oxidation of methyl mercaptan.\n\n===Dimethyl sulfide===\n[[File:dimethyl sulfide structure.svg|right|140px|Dimethyl sulfide]]\n[[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) is naturally present in most wines, probably from the breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids.  Like ethyl acetate, levels of DMS below the sensory threshold can have a positive effect on flavour, contributing to ''fruityness'', ''fullness'', and ''complexity''. Levels above the sensory threshold of >30&nbsp;\u03bcg/L in white wines and >50&nbsp;\u03bcg/L for red wines, give the wine characteristics of ''cooked cabbage'', ''canned corn'', ''asparagus'' or ''truffles''.\n\n==Environmental==\n\n===Cork taint===\n[[File:2,4,6-Trichloroanisole.svg|120px|right|thumb|2,4,6-trichloroanisole]]\n{{Main article|Cork taint}}\nCork taint is a wine fault mostly attributed to the compound [[2,4,6-trichloroanisole]] (TCA), although other compounds such as [[guaiacol]], [[geosmin]], [[2-methylisoborneol]], [[1-Octen-3-ol|1-octen-3-ol]], [[1-octen-3-one]], [[2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole]], [[pentachloroanisole]], and [[2,4,6-tribromoanisole]] are also thought to be involved.<ref name=LaMar>LaMar, Jim (09/25/02). [http://www.winepros.org/wine101/vincyc-tca.htm Cork Taint]. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.</ref> TCA most likely originates as a [[metabolite]] of [[Mold (fungus)|mould]] growth on [[chlorine]]-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes ''earthy'', ''mouldy'', and ''musty'' aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as ''\"corked\"''. As cork taint has gained a wide reputation as a wine fault, other faults are often mistakenly attributed to it.\n\n===Heat damage===\nHeat damaged wines are often casually referred to as ''cooked'', which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as '''maderized''' wine, from [[Madeira wine]], which is intentionally exposed to heat.  The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13&nbsp;\u00b0C (55&nbsp;\u00b0F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will [[thermal expansion|thermally expand]], and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible along the length of the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.\n\nEven if the temperatures do not reach extremes, temperature variation alone can also damage bottled wine through oxidation. All corks allow some leakage of air (hence old wines become increasingly oxidized), and temperature fluctuations will vary the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the bottle and will act to \"pump\" air into the bottle at a faster rate than will occur at any temperature strictly maintained.\n\nReputedly, heat damage is the most widespread and common problem found in wines. It often goes unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often would just chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.\n\n===Lightstrike===\nLightstruck wines are those that have had excessive exposure to [[ultraviolet]] light, particularly in the range 325 to 450&nbsp;nm.<ref name=drouhin>Drouhin, R.J. (01/23/98) [http://www.drouhin.com/wineviti/glasses.html Bottle Glass]. URL Accessed 3 April 2006</ref> Very delicate wines, such as [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]s, are generally worst affected, with the fault causing a ''wet cardboard'' or ''wet wool'' type flavour and aroma. Red wines rarely become lightstruck because of the phenolic compounds present within the wine that protect it. Lightstrike is thought to be caused by sulfur compounds such as [[dimethyl sulfide]]. In France lightstrike is known as \"''go\u00fbt de lumi\u00e8re''\", which translates to ''a taste of light''. The fault explains why wines are generally bottled in coloured glass, which blocks the ultraviolet light, and why wine should be stored in dark environments.\n\n===Ladybird (pyrazine) taint===\nSome insects present in the grapes at harvest inevitably end up in the press and for the most part are inoffensive. Others, notably the [[Harmonia axyridis|Asian lady beetle]], release unpleasant smelling nitrogen heterocycles as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's odor and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compound is [[isopropyl methoxy pyrazine]] - this molecule is perceived as rancid [[peanut butter]], green [[bell pepper]], urine, or simply bitter. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so [[pyrazine]] taint has been known to make [[Riesling]]s taste like [[Sauvignon blanc]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.\n\n==Microbiological==\n\n===''Brettanomyces'' (''Dekkera'')===\n{{Main article|Brettanomyces}}\nThe yeast ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' produces an array of [[metabolite]]s when growing in wine, some of which are volatile [[Phenolic content in wine|phenol]]ic compounds. Together these compounds are often referred to as ''phenolic taint'', ''\"Brettanomyces character\"'', or simply \"Brett\". The main constituents are listed below, with their sensory threshold and common sensory descriptors:\n*'''[[4-ethylphenol]]''' (>140&nbsp;\u03bcg/L): Band-aids, barnyard, horse stable, antiseptic\n*'''[[4-ethylguaiacol]]''' (>600&nbsp;\u03bcg/L): Bacon, spice, cloves, smoky\n*'''[[3-Methylbutanoic acid|isovaleric acid]]''': Sweaty, cheese, rancidity\n\n===Geosmin===\n[[File:Geosmin minus acsv.svg|130px|right]]\n[[Geosmin]] is a compound with a very distinct ''earthy'', ''musty'', ''beetroot'', even ''turnip'' flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous [[Actinobacteria|actinomycetes]] such as ''[[Streptomyces]]'', and [[Mold (fungus)|mould]]s such as ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' and ''Penicillium expansum'', on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to [[terroir]].<ref name=kennel>Kennel, Florence (14/12/05). [http://www.decanter.com/news/60674.html Bordeaux boffin solves geosmin conundrum]. Decanter.com. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.</ref> The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and has been found in recent vintages of red wines from [[Beaujolais]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] and the [[Loire]] in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in [[cork taint]].\n\n===Lactic acid bacteria===\n{{Main article|Malolactic_fermentation#Wine_faults}}\n[[Lactic acid bacteria]] have a useful role in winemaking converting [[malic acid]] to lactic acid in [[malolactic fermentation]]. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria may still be present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming [[turbidity|turbid]], ''swampy'', and slightly [[effervescence|effervescent]] or ''spritzy''. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.\n\n====Bitterness taint====\n[[File:Acrolein-skeletal.png|right|120px|thumb|Acrolein]]\nBitterness taint or ''amertume'' is rather uncommon and is produced by certain strains of bacteria from the genera ''[[Pediococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Oenococcus]]''. It begins by the degradation of [[glycerol]], a compound naturally found in wine at levels of 5-8 g/L, via a [[dehydratase]] enzyme to ''3-hydroxypropionaldehyde''. During ageing this is further dehydrated to [[acrolein]] which reacts with the [[anthocyanin]]s and other phenols present within the wine to form the taint.<ref name=duToitM>duToit, M., Pretorius, I.S. (2000). \"Microbial spoilage and preservation of wine: Using weapons from nature's own arsenal - A review\". South African Journal of Enology and Viticulture 21: 74-96.</ref> As red wines contain high levels of anthocyanins they are generally more susceptible.\n\n====Diacetyl====\n[[File:diacetyl structure.svg|130px|right|thumb|Diacetyl]]\n[[Diacetyl]] in wine is produced by [[lactic acid bacteria]], mainly ''[[Oenococcus oeni]]''. In low levels it can impart positive ''nutty'' or ''caramel'' characters, however at levels above 5&nbsp;mg/L it creates an intense ''buttery'' or ''[[butterscotch]]'' flavour, where it is perceived as a flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide.

Potassium sorbate is sometimes added to wine as a [[preservative]] against yeast, however its use is generally kept to a minimum due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of [[sorbic acid]] to the alcohol ''[[sorbinol]]''. The alcohol is then [[isomerisation|isomerised]] in the presence of acid to ''[[3,5-hexadiene-2-ol]]'', which is then esterified with ethanol to form ''[[2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene]]''.<ref\nname=huhn/> As ethanol is necessary for the conversion, the geranium taint is not usually found in [[must]].\n\n====Mannitol====\n[[File:Mannitol structure.png|150px|thumb|right|Mannitol]]\n[[Mannitol]] is a [[sugar alcohol]], and in wine it is produced by [[heterofermentative]] lactic acid bacteria, such as ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'', by the [[redox|reduction]] of [[fructose]]. Its perception is often complicated as it generally exists in wine alongside other faults, but it is usually described as [[viscous]], [[ester]]-like combined with a sweet and irritating finish.<ref name=duToitM/>  Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation with a high level of [[residual sugar]]s still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.\n\n====Ropiness====\nRopiness is manifested as an increase in [[viscosity]] and a ''slimey'' or ''fatty'' mouthfeel of a wine. In France the fault is known as \"''graisse''\", which translates to ''fat''. The problem stems from the production of [[dextrin]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s by certain lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genera ''[[Leuconostoc]]'' and ''[[Pediococcus]]''.\n\n===Mousiness===\n[[File:1-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-yl)-ethanone.svg|right|thumb|150px|''2-acetyl-3,4,5,6-<br />tetrahydropyridine'']]\nMousiness is a wine fault most often attributed to ''Brettanomyces'' but can also originate from the [[lactic acid bacteria]] ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus fermentum]]'', and ''[[Lactobacillus hilgardii]],''<ref name=duToitM/> and hence can occur in [[malolactic fermentation]].

It occurs when [[sweetness of wine|sweet wines]] are bottled in non-[[Asepsis|sterile]] conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', but has also been attributed to ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' and ''[[Zygosaccharomyces bailii]]''.<ref name=duToitM/> The main issues associated with the fault include [[turbidity]] (from yeast [[biomass]] production), excess ethanol production (may violate [[wine label|labelling]] laws), slight [[carbonation]], and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as [[dimethyl dicarbonate]]. The [[Portuguese wine]] style known as \"[[vinho verde|vinhos verdes]]\" used to rely on this secondary fermentation in bottle to impart a slight [[spritz (wine)|spritziness]] to the wine, but now usually uses artificial carbonation.\n\n==  Bunch rots ==\nOrganisms responsible for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, the most common of these being ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi responsible for the rotting of grapes such as ''[[Aspergillus]]'' spp., ''[[Penicillium]]'' spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., ''[[Colletotrichum]]'' spp. (ripe rot) and ''[[Greeneria uvicola]]'' (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., [[Botryosphaeriaceae]], ''[[Phomopsis viticola]]''). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, [[2-methylisoborneol]], [[1-octen-3-ol]], [[2-octen-1-ol]], [[fenchol]] and [[fenchone]].<ref>Grapevine bunch rots: impacts on wine composition, quality, and potential procedures for the removal of wine faults.

Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to be of issue. In fact, depending on [[perception]], these concentrations may impart positive characters to the wine. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the [[sensory threshold]], they replace or obscure the [[flavor]]s and [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable.<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\">M.

Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor [[storage of the wine]] that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty [[stemware]] during [[wine tasting]] that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\"/><ref name=\"Bird pg 31-82, et al\">D. Bird ''\"Understanding Wine Technology\"'' pg 31-82, 155-184, 202-222 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between flaws and faults==\nIn wine tasting, there is a big distinction made between what is considered a ''flaw'' and a ''fault''. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive [[sulfur dioxide]], [[volatile acidity]], ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' or \"Brett aromas\" and [[diacetyl]] or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and [[recognition threshold]] of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and ''Brettanomyces'' can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include [[acetaldehyde]] (except when purposely induced in wines like [[Sherry]] and [[Rancio]]), [[ethyl acetate]] and [[cork taint]].<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\"/>\n\n==Detecting faults in wine tasting==\nThe vast majority of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and [[Browning in red wine|browning]] of the [[wine's color]]. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that are not meant to be [[sparkling (wine)|sparkling]] can be a sign of [[Fermentation (wine)|refermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]] happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive [[copper]], [[iron]] or [[proteins]] that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with [[volatile acidity]] that can make a wine seem out of balance.<ref name=\"Baldy pg 37-39, et al\"/><ref name=\"Bird pg 31-82, et al\"/>\n\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n||'''Wine fault'''\n||'''Characteristics'''\n|-\n| [[Acetaldehyde]]||Smell of roasted nuts or dried out straw.

[[Anthocyanin]]s, [[catechin]]s, epicatechins and other [[Phenolic content in wine|phenols]] present in wine are those most easily oxidised,<ref name=duToitW>duToit, W.J. (2005). [http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/200508oxygen.php3 Oxygen in winemaking: Part I]. WineLand. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.</ref> which leads to a loss of colour, flavour and aroma - sometimes referred to as ''flattening''. In most cases compounds such as [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[erythorbic acid]] are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their organoleptic effect.<ref name=goode>Goode, Jamie (05/16/05). [http://www.wineint.com/storyprint.asp?sc=1810 Oxidation (link is dead)]. Wine International. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.</ref> Apart from phenolic oxidation, the [[ethanol]] present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for flavour and aroma taints.\n\n[[File:Oxidation of ethanol.svg|center|thumb|500px|The oxidation of ethanol]]\n\n===Acetaldehyde===\n[[Acetaldehyde]] is an intermediate product of [[Yeast in winemaking|yeast]] [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]; however, it is more commonly associated with [[ethanol]] [[oxidation]] catalysed by the enzyme [[alcohol dehydrogenase|ethanol dehydrogenase]]. Acetaldehyde production is also associated with the presence of surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as [[acetic acid bacteria]], which form the compound by the [[decarboxylation]] of [[pyruvate]]. The [[sensory threshold]] for acetaldehyde is 100-125 [[Micrograms|mg]]/[[litre|L]]. Beyond this level it imparts a ''[[sherry]]'' type character to the wine which can also be described as ''green apple'', ''sour'' and ''metallic''. Acetaldehyde [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] is also implicated in [[hangover]]s.\n\n===Acetic acid===\n[[Acetic acid]] in wine, often referred to as volatile acidity (VA) or ''vinegar taint'', can be contributed by many wine spoilage [[yeasts]] and [[bacteria]]. This can be from either a [[by-product]] of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera ''[[Acetobacter]]'' and ''[[Gluconobacter]]'' produce high levels of acetic acid. The [[sensory threshold]] for acetic acid in wine is >700&nbsp;mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.\n\nThere are different opinions as to what level of volatile acidity is appropriate for higher quality wine. Although too high a concentration is sure to leave an undesirable, 'vinegar' tasting wine, some wine's acetic acid levels are developed to create a more 'complex', desirable taste.<ref>[http://www.wineint.com/story.asp?storyCode=1908 Volatile Acidity] - great article from [[Wine & Spirit]] mag</ref>  The renowned 1947 [[Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc|Cheval Blanc]] is widely recognized to contain high levels of volatile acidity.\n\n[[Ethyl acetate]] is formed in wine by the [[esterification]] of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels are more likely to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the volatile acidity. It is a common microbial fault produced by [[wine spoilage yeast]]s, particularly ''[[Pichia anomala]]'' or ''[[Kloeckera apiculata]]''. High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by [[lactic acid bacteria]] and [[acetic acid bacteria]].\n\n==Sulfur compounds==\n[[Sulfur]] is used as an [[food additive|additive]] throughout the winemaking process, primarily to stop oxidation as mentioned above but also as  [[antimicrobial]] agent. When managed properly in wine, its presence there is often undetected, however when used recklessly it can contribute to flavour and aroma taints which are very volatile and potent. Sulfur compounds typically have low sensory thresholds.\n\n===Sulfur dioxide===\n[[File:Sulfur-dioxide-2D.svg|right|150px|Sulfur dioxide]]\n[[Sulfur dioxide]] is a common wine additive, used for its [[antioxidant]] and [[preservative]] properties. When its use is not managed well it can be overadded, with its perception in wine reminiscent of ''matchsticks'', ''burnt rubber'', or ''mothballs''. Wines such as these are often termed ''sulfitic''.\n\n===Hydrogen sulfide===\n[[File:Hydrogen-sulfide-2D-dimensions.svg|right|150px|Hydrogen sulfide]]\n[[Hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) is generally thought to be a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in [[Yeast assimilable nitrogen|nitrogen limited environments]]. It is formed when yeast ferments via the [[sulfate reduction pathway]]. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with [[diammonium phosphate]] (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent H<sub>2</sub>S formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 \u03bcg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct ''rotten egg'' aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and [[disulfide]]s.\n\n===Mercaptans===\n[[File:Ethanethiol2.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[ethanethiol|ethyl mercaptan]]]]\n[[Mercaptans]] (thiols) are produced in wine by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with other wine components such as ethanol. They can be formed if finished wine is allowed prolonged contact with the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]]. This can be prevented by [[racking]] the wine. Mercaptans have a very low sensory threshold, around 1.5 [[Micrograms|\u03bcg]]/[[litre|L]],<ref name=ETS1>[http://www.etslabs.com/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=350 Technical Bulletin - Sulfides in Wine]. ETS Laboratories. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.</ref> with levels above causing ''onion'', ''rubber'', and ''skunk'' type odours. Note that dimethyl disulfide is formed from the oxidation of methyl mercaptan.\n\n===Dimethyl sulfide===\n[[File:dimethyl sulfide structure.svg|right|140px|Dimethyl sulfide]]\n[[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS) is naturally present in most wines, probably from the breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids.  Like ethyl acetate, levels of DMS below the sensory threshold can have a positive effect on flavour, contributing to ''fruityness'', ''fullness'', and ''complexity''. Levels above the sensory threshold of >30&nbsp;\u03bcg/L in white wines and >50&nbsp;\u03bcg/L for red wines, give the wine characteristics of ''cooked cabbage'', ''canned corn'', ''asparagus'' or ''truffles''.\n\n==Environmental==\n\n===Cork taint===\n[[File:2,4,6-Trichloroanisole.svg|120px|right|thumb|2,4,6-trichloroanisole]]\n{{Main article|Cork taint}}\nCork taint is a wine fault mostly attributed to the compound [[2,4,6-trichloroanisole]] (TCA), although other compounds such as [[guaiacol]], [[geosmin]], [[2-methylisoborneol]], [[1-Octen-3-ol|1-octen-3-ol]], [[1-octen-3-one]], [[2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole]], [[pentachloroanisole]], and [[2,4,6-tribromoanisole]] are also thought to be involved.<ref name=LaMar>LaMar, Jim (09/25/02). [http://www.winepros.org/wine101/vincyc-tca.htm Cork Taint]. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.</ref> TCA most likely originates as a [[metabolite]] of [[mould]] growth on [[chlorine]]-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes ''earthy'', ''mouldy'', and ''musty'' aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as ''\"corked\"''. As cork taint has gained a wide reputation as a wine fault, other faults are often mistakenly attributed to it.\n\n===Heat damage===\nHeat damaged wines are often casually referred to as ''cooked'', which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as '''maderized''' wine, from [[Madeira wine]], which is intentionally exposed to heat.  The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13&nbsp;\u00b0C (55&nbsp;\u00b0F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will [[thermal expansion|thermally expand]], and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible along the length of the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.\n\nEven if the temperatures do not reach extremes, temperature variation alone can also damage bottled wine through oxidation. All corks allow some leakage of air (hence old wines become increasingly oxidized), and temperature fluctuations will vary the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the bottle and will act to \"pump\" air into the bottle at a faster rate than will occur at any temperature strictly maintained.\n\nReputedly, heat damage is the most widespread and common problem found in wines. It often goes unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often would just chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.\n\n===Lightstrike===\nLightstruck wines are those that have had excessive exposure to [[ultraviolet]] light, particularly in the range 325 to 450&nbsp;nm.<ref name=drouhin>Drouhin, R.J. (01/23/98) [http://www.drouhin.com/wineviti/glasses.html Bottle Glass]. URL Accessed 3 April 2006</ref> Very delicate wines, such as [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]s, are generally worst affected, with the fault causing a ''wet cardboard'' or ''wet wool'' type flavour and aroma. Red wines rarely become lightstruck because of the phenolic compounds present within the wine that protect it. Lightstrike is thought to be caused by sulfur compounds such as [[dimethyl sulfide]]. In France lightstrike is known as \"''go\u00fbt de lumi\u00e8re''\", which translates to ''a taste of light''. The fault explains why wines are generally bottled in coloured glass, which blocks the ultraviolet light, and why wine should be stored in dark environments.\n\n===Ladybird (pyrazine) taint===\nSome insects present in the grapes at harvest inevitably end up in the press and for the most part are inoffensive. Others, notably the [[Harmonia axyridis|Asian lady beetle]], release unpleasant smelling nitrogen heterocycles as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's odor and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compound is [[isopropyl methoxy pyrazine]] - this molecule is perceived as rancid [[peanut butter]], green [[bell pepper]], urine, or simply bitter. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so [[pyrazine]] taint has been known to make [[Riesling]]s taste like [[Sauvignon blanc]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}.\n\n==Microbiological==\n\n===''Brettanomyces'' (''Dekkera'')===\n{{Main article|Brettanomyces}}\nThe yeast ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' produces an array of [[metabolite]]s when growing in wine, some of which are volatile [[Phenolic content in wine|phenol]]ic compounds. Together these compounds are often referred to as ''phenolic taint'', ''\"Brettanomyces character\"'', or simply \"Brett\". The main constituents are listed below, with their sensory threshold and common sensory descriptors:\n*'''[[4-ethylphenol]]''' (>140&nbsp;\u03bcg/L): Band-aids, barnyard, horse stable, antiseptic\n*'''[[4-ethylguaiacol]]''' (>600&nbsp;\u03bcg/L): Bacon, spice, cloves, smoky\n*'''[[3-Methylbutanoic acid|isovaleric acid]]''': Sweaty, cheese, rancidity\n\n===Geosmin===\n[[File:Geosmin minus acsv.svg|130px|right]]\n[[Geosmin]] is a compound with a very distinct ''earthy'', ''musty'', ''beetroot'', even ''turnip'' flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous [[Actinobacteria|actinomycetes]] such as ''[[Streptomyces]]'', and [[mold|mould]]s such as ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' and ''Penicillium expansum'', on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to [[terroir]].<ref name=kennel>Kennel, Florence (14/12/05). [http://www.decanter.com/news/60674.html Bordeaux boffin solves geosmin conundrum]. Decanter.com. URL accessed on 2 April 2006.</ref> The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and has been found in recent vintages of red wines from [[Beaujolais]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] and the [[Loire]] in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in [[cork taint]].\n\n===Lactic acid bacteria===\n{{Main article|Malolactic_fermentation#Wine_faults}}\n[[Lactic acid bacteria]] have a useful role in winemaking converting [[malic acid]] to lactic acid in [[malolactic fermentation]]. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria may still be present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming [[turbidity|turbid]], ''swampy'', and slightly [[effervescence|effervescent]] or ''spritzy''. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.\n\n====Bitterness taint====\n[[File:Acrolein-skeletal.png|right|120px|thumb|Acrolein]]\nBitterness taint or ''amertume'' is rather uncommon and is produced by certain strains of bacteria from the genera ''[[Pediococcus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Oenococcus]]''. It begins by the degradation of [[glycerol]], a compound naturally found in wine at levels of 5-8 g/L, via a [[dehydratase]] enzyme to ''3-hydroxypropionaldehyde''. During ageing this is further dehydrated to [[acrolein]] which reacts with the [[anthocyanin]]s and other phenols present within the wine to form the taint.<ref name=duToitM>duToit, M., Pretorius, I.S.

South African Journal of Enology and Viticulture 21: 74-96.</ref> As red wines contain high levels of anthocyanins they are generally more susceptible.\n\n====Diacetyl====\n[[File:diacetyl structure.svg|130px|right|thumb|Diacetyl]]\n[[Diacetyl]] in wine is produced by [[lactic acid bacteria]], mainly ''[[Oenococcus oeni]]''. In low levels it can impart positive ''nutty'' or ''caramel'' characters, however at levels above 5&nbsp;mg/L it creates an intense ''buttery'' or ''[[butterscotch]]'' flavour, where it is perceived as a flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of [[citric acid]] when all of the [[malic acid]] has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.<ref name=gibson>Gibson, George; Farkas, Mike [http://www.bcawa.ca/winemaking/flaws.htm Flaws and Faults in Wine].

Its perception is often complicated as it generally exists in wine alongside other faults, but it is usually described as [[viscous]], [[ester]]-like combined with a sweet and irritating finish.<ref name=duToitM/>  Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation with a high level of [[residual sugar]]s still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.\n\n====Ropiness====\nRopiness is manifested as an increase in [[viscosity]] and a ''slimey'' or ''fatty'' mouthfeel of a wine. In France the fault is known as \"''graisse''\", which translates to ''fat''. The problem stems from the production of [[dextrin]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s by certain lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genera ''[[Leuconostoc]]'' and ''[[Pediococcus]]''.\n\n===Mousiness===\n[[File:1-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-yl)-ethanone.svg|right|thumb|150px|''2-acetyl-3,4,5,6-<br />tetrahydropyridine'']]\nMousiness is a wine fault most often attributed to ''Brettanomyces'' but can also originate from the [[lactic acid bacteria]] ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus fermentum]]'', and ''[[Lactobacillus hilgardii]],''<ref name=duToitM/> and hence can occur in [[malolactic fermentation]]. The compounds responsible are [[lysine]] derivatives, mainly;\n*[[2-acetyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine]]\n*[[2-acetyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridine]]\n*[[2-ethyltetrahydropyridine]]<ref name=marias>Marais, Johann [http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/0299nitrogen.php3 Flavourful nitrogen containing wine constituents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928171657/http://www.wynboer.co.za/recentarticles/0299nitrogen.php3 |date=2006-09-28 }}. Wynboer. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.</ref>\n*[[2-acetyl-1-pyrrolene]]\nThe taints are not volatile at the [[pH]] of wine, and therefore not obvious as an aroma. However, when mixed with the slightly basic pH of saliva they can become very apparent on the palate,<ref name=gawell>Gawell, Richard [http://www.aromadictionary.com/articles/mousey_article.html Somellier, A Mouse Must Have Wee'd in My Wine!]. aromadictionary.com. URL accessed on 12 March 2006.</ref> especially at the back of the mouth, as ''mouse cage'' or ''mouse urine''.\n\n=== Refermentation ===\nRefermentation, sometimes called [[secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]], is caused by yeasts refermenting the [[residual sugar]] present within bottled wine. It occurs when [[sweetness of wine|sweet wines]] are bottled in non-[[Asepsis|sterile]] conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', but has also been attributed to ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' and ''[[Zygosaccharomyces bailii]]''.<ref name=duToitM/> The main issues associated with the fault include [[turbidity]] (from yeast [[biomass]] production), excess ethanol production (may violate [[wine label|labelling]] laws), slight [[carbonation]], and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as [[dimethyl dicarbonate]]. The [[Portuguese wine]] style known as \"[[vinho verde|vinhos verdes]]\" used to rely on this secondary fermentation in bottle to impart a slight [[spritz (wine)|spritziness]] to the wine, but now usually uses artificial carbonation.\n\n==  Bunch rots ==\nOrganisms responsible for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, the most common of these being ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi responsible for the rotting of grapes such as ''[[Aspergillus]]'' spp., ''[[Penicillium]]'' spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., ''[[Colletotrichum]]'' spp. (ripe rot) and ''[[Greeneria uvicola]]'' (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., [[Botryosphaeriaceae]], ''[[Phomopsis viticola]]''). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, [[2-methylisoborneol]], [[1-octen-3-ol]], [[2-octen-1-ol]], [[fenchol]] and [[fenchone]].<ref>Grapevine bunch rots: impacts on wine composition, quality, and potential procedures for the removal of wine faults.

The film is an adaptation of the Dutch book [[Achtste-groepers huilen niet|of the same name]] by Jacques Vriens. It was first released into cinemas in the Netherlands on February 15, 2012, and has won a 2012 [[Golden Film|Golden Film Award]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nAkkie (pronounced as Ah-key) (Hanna Obbeek) is an 8th grade student. In her free time she enjoys to play football. She has a few good friends and likes most of the kids in her class. However, there is one boy she hates. His name is Joep (pronounced as Yoop) and the two have a row every other day. But one day, when the class plays football during lunch break, Joep goes too far and hurts Elise, Akkie's best friend. Akkie wants to take revenge and after school, Joep and Akkie start a fight. The fight ends soon, because their teachers finds out about it. Akkies nose is bleeding when she returns home. Later that evening, her nose spontaneously starts bleeding again. Her mother is worried and takes her daughter to see a doctor.\nThings take a turn for the tragic when Akkie discovers she has [[leukemia]]. Despite this, Akkie tries to keep busy helping prepare for the next football tournament. Her friends support her, but Akkie is discouraged when she has to spend several days in the hospital. Still, she is desperate to go on a school camp where she plays various games. When they play hide and seek, Akkie hides in a tree. She can't come down herself and eventually Joep climbs in the tree to help her get down. From that moment on, the two are friends. The same day, Akkie suddenly passes out. She has to be taken to hospital.\n\nAkkie starts [[chemotherapy]], but because the leukemia is so aggressive, Akkie begins to realize that she probably will not survive. In an emotional scene, Akkie learns that the cancer has spread to her brain and that she has a terminal illness. She asks her best friend Elise (Fiona Livingston) to play on her behalf in the football tournament, since she knows she will not be able to attend the tournament on her own. This leads her teammates to play an impromptu game at the hospital, where Akkie\u2019s bed is in a room facing the field so she can watch the game. Happily watching them play, Akkie dies peacefully. Her classmates will honour Akkie in the school tournament, where she attends in spirit through her classmates wearing her name on his uniforms and banners throughout the area.\n\n==Cast==\n* Hanna Obbeek as Akkie\n*[[Nils Verkooijen]] as Joep\n*[[Fiona Livingston]] as Elise\n*[[Bram Flick]] as Laurens\n*[[Amin Belyandouz]] as Brammetje\n*[[Eva Van Der Gucht]] as Juf Ina\n*[[Loek Peters]] as Dokter Snor\n*[[Johanna ter Steege]] as Moeder Akkie\n*[[Reinout Bussemaker]] as Vader Akkie\n*[[Chris Comvalius]] as Afida (as Chrisje Comvalius)\n*[[Xander Straat]] as Meester Henk\n*[[Bram van der Hooven]] as Frenklin\n*[[Lea Vlastra]] as Tamara\n*[[Renee de Graaff]] as Christel\n*[[Lucas Dijker]] as Rico\n\n==Reception==\n\n\n===Awards===\n*''[[Golden Film|Golden Film Award]]'' (2012, won)<ref>{{cite web|title=ACHTSTE-GROEPERS HUILEN NIET |url=http://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/over-nff/filmprijzen/gouden-films/achtste-groepers-huilen-niet/ |publisher=Nederlands Film Festival |accessdate=4 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504143307/http://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/over-nff/filmprijzen/gouden-films/achtste-groepers-huilen-niet/ |archivedate=4 May 2014 }}</ref>\n*''[[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf Audience Award]]'' at the [[Nederlands Film Festival]] (2012, won)<ref>{{cite web|title=Wederom prijzen voor \u2018Achtste-Groepers Huilen Niet\u2019|url=http://www.nbf.nl/2013/02/11/wederom-prijzen-voor-%E2%80%98achtste-groepers-huilen-niet/|publisher=NBF|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> \n*''[[Rembrandt Award]] for Best Dutch Youth Film'' (2012, won)<ref>{{cite web|title=Rembrandt Awards winnaar is \u2018Alles Is Familie\u2019|url=http://radio.nl/778247/rembrandt-awards-winnaar-is-alles-is-familie|publisher=Radio.nl|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> \n*''Rembrandt Award for Best Dutch Actress'' (2012, nominated -

Between tours, the band released two more EPs: ''[[With Our Wallets Full]]'' and ''[[Up in Rags]]'', in 2006. Monarchy Music would re-release those EPs as one compilation album titled ''[[Up in Rags/With Our Wallets Full]]'' in 2006.\n\nIn summer 2006, Cold War Kids signed with [[Downtown Records]] and started work on their debut album.

Former members of the band include [[Dann Gallucci]] (guitar, keyboards, percussion), Matt Aveiro (drums, percussion), and Jonnie Russell (guitar, [[backing vocals|vocals]], piano, keyboards, percussion).\n\nForming in 2004 in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] California, the Cold War Kids' early releases came from [[independent record label]] Monarchy Music. In 2006, the band signed with [[Downtown Records|Downtown]]/[[V2 Records|V2]] and released their major label debut ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' to cult appeal from fans and critics. 2008's ''[[Loyalty to Loyalty]]'' and 2011's ''[[Mine Is Yours]]'' saw the band develop different musical sounds and lyrical content throughout to mixed reviews. The band's seventh studio album, ''New Age Norms 1'', was released on November 1, 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===2004\u20132006: Early years and ''Robbers & Cowards''===\n[[File:ColdWarKids NY07 rotated cropped.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Cold War Kids performing at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City, 2007]]\nThe members of Cold War Kids met at [[Biola University]].<ref name=\"Stereogum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/4368/christianity_and_the_cold_war_kids_backlash/news/|title=Christianity And The Cold War Kids Backlash|author=Stereogum Staff|work=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref> They formed a band in 2004 when they would meet regularly in Jonnie Russell's apartment above a restaurant called Mulberry Street in downtown [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]]. Maust came up with the band's name around 1997, during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother, where they found a park in [[Budapest]] with missing statues, taken away after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in the park, Maust said \"...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' pop into my head. I may have heard it before.

The band relocated to [[Whittier, California]], and began recording their first demo, which Monarchy Music released as the EP ''[[Mulberry Street (EP)|Mulberry Street]]'' (based on the restaurant where they regularly met) in spring 2005. Between tours, the band released two more EPs: ''[[With Our Wallets Full]]'' and ''[[Up in Rags]]'', in 2006.

He was a very productive [[luthier]], known for making over 5000 violins and 100 violas with his staff at his workshop.<ref name=\"Fairfield\">Fairfield, John H. (1942) ''Known Violin Makers''. Virtuoso Pubns Inc. {{ISBN|0-918624-00-2}}</ref> He also created 30 unique, high-end archtop guitars, one of which, the Wilkanowski Airway W-4, was famously owned by [[Johnny Cash]] since the 1980s.<ref name=\"Cash\">[https://www.retrofret.com/product.asp?ProductID=4172] Wilkanowski Airway W-4 owned by Cash, listed as auction item</ref>\n\nWilkanowski was also known to be a family man, marrying early to his wife Amelia (1885/1886 - May 10, 1952),<ref name=\"graveWife\">[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/171555967/amelia-wilkanowski] Grave of Amelia Wilkanowski</ref> with whom he had raised 9 children. When Amelia got sick, in 1950 he sold his shop property and moved his workshop to their Long Island home to be close to her and look after her. After she died of the illness in 1952, he became very depressed and despondent without her.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref> He stopped making instruments altogether and lost his source of income, which negatively affected his finances, adding to his depressive state.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\">William Wilkanowski biography article by Ira Kraemer in the Cozio Archive</ref> In early December 1954, he finally committed suicide<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref> and was laid to rest next to Amelia on December 13, 1954.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref><ref name=\"grave\"></ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWilkanowski was born on November 15, 1886 as listed on his grave and in the draft card, and the year 1886 indicated as estimated  in several census records of New York. Only one source says March 15, 1885<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> and his obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n<br>\nAccording to Fairfield's book, he built his first violin already at age 9 in 1895, which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n<br>\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and transcribed as Wikanski. <ref name=\"1920census\">1920 New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br|As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial letter, such as William, which would not be used by Polish speakers in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. By the year [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n<br> \nWilliam worked in the shops of Ditson (Boston) and Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]) until he opened his own workshop and store in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars.  By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004, to appear again on auction in 2009.<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969).

When Amelia got sick, in 1950 he sold his shop property and moved his workshop to their Long Island home to be close to her and look after her. After she died of the illness in 1952, he became very depressed and despondent without her.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref> He stopped making instruments altogether and lost his source of income, which negatively affected his finances, adding to his depressive state. In early December 1954, he finally committed suicide<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref> and was laid to rest next to Amelia on December 13, 1954.<ref name=\"obituary\"></ref><ref name=\"grave\"></ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWilkanowski was born on November 15, 1886 as listed on his grave and in the draft card, and the year 1886 indicated as estimated  in several census records of New York. Only one source says March 15, 1885<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> and his obituary states his age to be 69 in December 1954, which would then indicate the birth year as 1885. The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n<br>\nAccording to Fairfield's book, he built his first violin already at age 9 in 1895, which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n<br>\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and transcribed as Wikanski. <ref name=\"1920census\">1920 New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br|As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial letter, such as William, which would not be used by Polish speakers in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. By the year [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n<br> \nWilliam worked in the shops of Ditson (Boston) and Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]) until he opened his own workshop and store in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars.  By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004, to appear again on auction in 2009.<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969). His wife would go by her middle name Amelia, sometimes registered as Emilia. In the 1940 New York census, she is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old.

He has spent his whole life tending the garden and has never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from what he sees on television. When his benefactor dies, Chance naively tells the lawyers that he has no claim against the estate and is ordered to move out.\n\nChance wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. Passing by a TV shop, he sees himself captured by a camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a chauffeured car owned by elderly business mogul Ben Rand. In the car is Rand's much younger wife Eve, who mishears \"Chance, the gardener\" in reply to the question who he is, as \"Chauncey Gardiner.\"\n\nEve brings Chance to their home to recover. He is wearing expensive tailored clothes from the 1920s and 1930s, which his benefactor had allowed him to take from the attic, and his manners are old-fashioned and courtly. When Ben Rand meets him, he takes \"Chauncey\" for an upper-class, highly-educated businessman who has fallen on hard times. Rand admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful.\n\nRand is also a confidant and advisor to the [[President of the United States]], whom he introduces to \"Chauncey.\" In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words \"stimulate growth\" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes \u201cChauncey Gardiner\u201d in a speech. Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important dinners, develops a close connection with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ambassador, and appears on a television talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on what would be his presidential policy.\n\nThough he has now risen to the top of Washington society, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and some 16 other agencies are unable to find any background information on him. During this time Rand's physician, Dr. Allenby, becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that the mystery of his identity may have a more mundane explanation. Dr. Allenby considers telling Rand this, but realizing how happy Chance is making him in his final days keeps him silent. \n\nThe dying Rand encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey.\" She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which happens to be showing on the TV. When the scene ends, Chauncey stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but decides she is willing to [[masturbate]] for his voyeuristic pleasure, thereby not noticing that he has turned back to the TV and is now imitating a yoga exercise on a different channel.\n\nChance is present at Rand's death and shows genuine sadness at his passing. Questioned by Dr. Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, \"I understand,\" but interpretation of that is left to the viewer. \n\nWhile the President delivers a speech at Rand's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next term of office and unanimously agree on Chauncey Gardiner as successor. Oblivious to all this, Chance wanders off through Rand's wintry estate. He straightens out a pine [[Tree#Overview|sapling]] flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake. He pauses, dips his umbrella deep into the water under his feet, then continues on, while the President is heard quoting Rand: \"Life is a state of mind.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Chance the gardener (Chauncey Gardiner)\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Eve Rand\n* [[Melvyn Douglas]] as Ben Rand\n* [[Richard A.

He has spent his whole life tending the garden and has never left the property. Other than gardening, his knowledge is derived entirely from what he sees on television. When his benefactor dies, Chance naively tells the lawyers that he has no claim against the estate and is ordered to move out.\n\nChance wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. Passing by a TV shop, he sees himself captured by a camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a chauffeured car owned by elderly business mogul Ben Rand. In the car is Rand's much younger wife Eve, who mishears \"Chance, the gardener\" in reply to the question who he is, as \"Chauncey Gardiner.\"\n\nEve brings Chance to their home to recover. He is wearing expensive tailored clothes from the 1920s and 1930s, which his benefactor had allowed him to take from the attic, and his manners are old-fashioned and courtly. When Ben Rand meets him, he takes \"Chauncey\" for an upper-class, highly-educated businessman who has fallen on hard times. Rand admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful.\n\nRand is also a confidant and advisor to the [[President of the United States]], whom he introduces to \"Chauncey.\" In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words \"stimulate growth\" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes \u201cChauncey Gardiner\u201d in a speech. Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important dinners, develops a close connection with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ambassador, and appears on a television talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on what would be his presidential policy.\n\nThough he has now risen to the top of Washington society, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and some 16 other agencies are unable to find any background information on him. During this time Rand's physician, Dr. Allenby, becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that the mystery of his identity may have a more mundane explanation. Dr. Allenby considers telling Rand this, but realizing how happy Chance is making him in his final days keeps him silent. \n\nThe dying Rand encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey.\" She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which happens to be showing on the TV. When the scene ends, Chauncey stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but decides she is willing to [[masturbate]] for his voyeuristic pleasure, thereby not noticing that he has turned back to the TV and is now imitating a yoga exercise on a different channel.\n\nChance is present at Rand's death and shows genuine sadness at his passing. Questioned by Dr. Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, \"I understand,\" but interpretation of that is left to the viewer. \n\nWhile the President delivers a speech at Rand's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next term of office and unanimously agree on Chauncey Gardiner as successor. Oblivious to all this, Chance wanders off through Rand's wintry estate. He straightens out a pine [[Tree#Overview|sapling]] flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake. He pauses, dips his umbrella deep into the water under his feet, then continues on, while the President is heard quoting Rand: \"Life is a state of mind.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Chance the gardener (Chauncey Gardiner)\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Eve Rand\n* [[Melvyn Douglas]] as Ben Rand\n* [[Richard A.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

It takes its name from the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]], the monastery which stands at the eastern end of the street, and which in turn commemorates the Russian hero Prince Saint [[Alexander Nevsky]] (1221-1263). Following his founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703, Tsar [[Peter the Great | Peter I]] planned the course of the street as the beginning of the road to [[Veliky Novgorod| Novgorod]] and Moscow. The avenue runs from the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty]] in the west to the [[Moskovsky railway station (Saint Petersburg) |Moscow Railway Station]] and, after veering slightly southwards at [[Vosstaniya Square]], to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.\n\nMajor sights include the [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli| Rastrelliesque]] [[Stroganov Palace]], the huge [[Neoclassicism |neoclassical]] [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg |Kazan Cathedral]], the [[Art Nouveau]] [[Singer House| ''Bookhouse'']] (originally the Singer House), [[Eliseyev Emporium (Saint Petersburg)| Elisseeff Emporium]], half a dozen 18th-century churches, a monument to [[Catherine the Great]], an enormous [[Great Gostiny Dvor| 18th-century shopping mall]], a [[Passage (department store)| mid-19th-century department store]], the [[National Library of Russia| Russian National Library]], and the [[Anichkov Bridge]] with its horse statues. \n\n[[Nikolai Gogol]] described the feverish life of the avenue in his story [[Nevsky Prospekt (story)| \"Nevsky Prospekt\"]], published in 1835. [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] often employed Nevsky Prospekt as a setting in his works, such as ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and [[The Double (Dostoevsky novel)| ''The Double: A Petersburg Poem'']] (1846). The caf\u00e9-restaurant which the famous writers of the 19th-century [[Russian literature#Golden Age| Golden Age of the Russian literature]] frequented still remains as [[Literaturnoye Kafe (Saint Petersburg)| \"Literary Cafe\"]] on Nevsky Prospect.\n \nDuring the early Soviet years (1918\u201344) the name of Nevsky Prospect was changed, first and briefly to \"Proletkult Street\" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in honor of [[Proletkult | that Soviet artistic organization]].<ref>Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.''

It takes its name from the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]], the monastery which stands at the eastern end of the street, and which in turn commemorates the Russian hero Prince Saint [[Alexander Nevsky]] (1221-1263). Following his founding of Saint Petersburg in 1703, Tsar [[Peter the Great | Peter I]] planned the course of the street as the beginning of the road to [[Veliky Novgorod| Novgorod]] and Moscow. The avenue runs from the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty]] in the west to the [[Moskovsky railway station (Saint Petersburg) |Moscow Railway Station]] and, after veering slightly southwards at [[Vosstaniya Square]], to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.\n\nMajor sights include the [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli| Rastrelliesque]] [[Stroganov Palace]], the huge [[Neoclassicism |neoclassical]] [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg |Kazan Cathedral]], the [[Art Nouveau]] [[Singer House| ''Bookhouse'']], [[Eliseyev Emporium (Saint Petersburg)| Elisseeff Emporium]], half a dozen 18th-century churches, a monument to [[Catherine the Great]], an enormous [[Great Gostiny Dvor| 18th-century shopping mall]], a [[Passage (department store)| mid-19th-century department store]], the [[National Library of Russia| Russian National Library]], the [[Anichkov Bridge]] with its horse statues, and the [[Singer House]]. \n\n[[Nikolai Gogol]] described the feverish life of the avenue in his story [[Nevsky Prospekt (story)| \"Nevsky Prospekt\"]], published in 1835. [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] often employed Nevsky Prospekt as a setting in his works, such as ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866) and [[The Double (Dostoevsky novel)| ''The Double: A Petersburg Poem'']] (1846). The caf\u00e9-restaurant which the famous writers of the 19th-century [[Russian literature#Golden Age| Golden Age of the Russian literature]] frequented still remains as [[Literaturnoye Kafe (Saint Petersburg)| \"Literary Cafe\"]] on Nevsky Prospect.\n \nDuring the early Soviet years (1918\u201344) the name of Nevsky Prospect was changed, first and briefly to \"Proletkult Street\" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in honor of [[Proletkult | that Soviet artistic organization]].<ref>Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.''

Mrs. Clements had been manually strangled and then wrapped up in her bedspread, nightgown disarranged, her head put against the foot of the bed and her right leg beneath her.

She was found by a neighbor, a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], on March 1, 1986, who got worried after knocking on the door and receiving no reply. She was found lying on her bed in the fetal position, covered with a bedspread and blanket, and her face covered by a pillow and her blue nightgown. The apartment had been turned upside down, with items from a pocketbook strewn about and a bloody pillowcase placed between her legs.

Mrs. Clements had been manually strangled and then wrapped up in her bedspread, nightgown disarranged, her head put against the foot of the bed and her right leg beneath her. Her plants had been overturned, her drawers emptied, with the killer then stealing her 25-inch color TV set and a pocketbook.<ref name=sly/> There were no suspects in this case either, as Aretha rarely left her home, except when visiting her best friend or for treatment at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]].<ref>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41652957/aretha-clements-hunter-victim/|title=Son finds mother, 61, slain at her small apartment|author=Larry Copeland|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=March 7, 1986}}</ref>\n\nThe situation repeated on March 11, with the discovery of the body of 62-year-old Dena Mae Mike, a blind woman who hasn't been seen in two days.<ref name=hunt>{{Citeweb|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41653182/dena-mae-mike-pt1-hunter/|title=Police hunt link in slayings of 3 elderly women|author=Larry Copeland|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=March 12, 1986}}</ref> Similarly to Copeland and Clements, she had either been smothered, and several objects had been placed on her head, including a sweater, a pillow, a plastic garment bag with clothing on hangers and a duffel bag.

{"title_page": "Financial ratio", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Corporate finance}}\n{{Accounting}}\nA '''financial ratio''' or '''accounting ratio''' is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's [[financial statement]]s. Often used in [[accounting]], there are many standard [[ratio]]s used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential [[shareholder]]s (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's [[creditor]]s. [[Financial analyst]]s use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Groppelli |first = Angelico A. |author2=Ehsan Nikbakht |title = Finance, 4th ed |publisher = Barron's Educational Series, Inc.|year = 2000 |pages =433 |isbn = 0-7641-1275-9 }}</ref> If shares in a company are traded in a [[financial market]], the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\n\nRatios can be expressed as a [[Decimal separator|decimal value]], such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent [[percent]] value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as [[earnings yield]], while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as [[P/E ratio]]; these latter are also called '''multiples.''' Given any ratio, one can take its [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\n\n==Sources of data==\nValues used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the [[balance sheet]], [[income statement]], [[statement of cash flows]] or (sometimes) the [[statement of changes in equity]]. These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or [[financial statements]]. The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\n\n==Purpose and types==\nFinancial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the [[financial statement analysis]]. Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures. '''Liquidity ratios''' measure the availability of cash to pay debt.<ref>Groppelli, p. 434.</ref> '''Activity ratios''' measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets.<ref name=\"Groppelli, p. 436\">Groppelli, p. 436.</ref> [[Debt ratio]]s measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt.<ref name=\"Groppelli, p. 439\">Groppelli, p. 439.</ref> '''Profitability ratios''' measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return.<ref>Groppelli, p. 442.</ref> '''Market ratios''' measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock.<ref name=\"Groppelli, p. 445\">Groppelli, p. 445.</ref>\nThese are concerned with the return on investment for [[shareholder]]s, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\n\nFinancial ratios allow for comparisons\n* between companies\n* between industries\n* between different time periods for one company\n* between a single company and its industry average\n\nRatios generally are not useful unless they are [[Benchmarking|benchmarked]] against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare.\n\n==Accounting methods and principles==\nFinancial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different [[accounting methods]] or follow various [[standard accounting practice]]s. Most [[public company|public companies]] are required by law to use [[generally accepted accounting principles]] for their home countries, but [[private company|private companies]], [[partnership]]s and [[sole proprietorship]]s may not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country.\n\nThere is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods.\n\n==Abbreviations and terminology==\nVarious abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the [[Internet]]. [[Sales (accounting)|Sales]] reported by a firm are usually [[net sales]], which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an [[invoice]]. [[Net income]] is always the amount ''after'' taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below).\n\nCompanies that are primarily involved in providing services with labour do not generally report \"Sales\" based on hours. These companies tend to report \"revenue\" based on the monetary value of income that the services provide.\n\nNote that Shareholders' Equity and Owner's Equity are ''not'' the same thing, Shareholder's Equity represents the total number of shares in the company multiplied by each share's book value; Owner's Equity represents the total number of shares that an individual shareholder owns (usually the owner with [[controlling interest]]), multiplied by each share's book value. It is important to make this distinction when calculating ratios.\n\n===Abbreviations===\n(''Note: '' These are not ratios, but values in currency.)\n* [[Cost of goods sold|COGS]] = Cost of goods sold, or cost of sales.\n* [[Earnings before interest and taxes|EBIT]] = [[Net income|Earnings]] before [[interest]] and [[taxes]]\n* [[EBITDA]] = Earnings before interest, taxes, [[depreciation]], and [[amortization]]\n* [[Earnings per share|EPS]] = Earnings per share\n\n==Ratios==\n\n===Profitability ratios===\nProfitability ratios measure the company's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return\n:;[[Gross margin]], '''Gross profit margin''' or '''Gross Profit Rate'''<ref>Williams, P. 265.</ref><ref name=\"Williams, p. 1094\">Williams, p. 1094.</ref>\n\n:::<math>\\frac{\\mbox{Gross Profit}}{\\mbox{Net Sales}}</math> :::'''OR''' :::<math>\\frac{\\mbox{Net Sales - COGS}}{\\mbox{Net Sales}}</math>\n\n----\n\n:;[[Operating margin]], '''Operating Income Margin''', '''Operating profit margin''' or '''Return on sales''' (ROS)<ref name=\"Williams, p. 1094\"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Williams |first=Jan R. |author2=Susan F.

Often used in [[accounting]], there are many standard [[ratio]]s used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential [[shareholder]]s (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's [[creditor]]s. [[Financial analyst]]s use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Groppelli |first = Angelico A. |author2=Ehsan Nikbakht |title = Finance, 4th ed |publisher = Barron's Educational Series, Inc.|year = 2000 |pages =433 |isbn = 0-7641-1275-9 }}</ref> If shares in a company are traded in a [[financial market]], the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\n\nRatios can be expressed as a [[Decimal separator|decimal value]], such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent [[percent]] value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as [[earnings yield]], while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as [[P/E ratio]]; these latter are also called '''multiples.''' Given any ratio, one can take its [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\n\n==Sources of data==\nValues used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the [[balance sheet]], [[income statement]], [[statement of cash flows]] or (sometimes) the [[statement of changes in equity]]. These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or [[financial statements]]. The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\n\n==Purpose and types==\nFinancial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the [[financial statement analysis]]. Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures. '''Liquidity ratios''' measure the availability of cash to pay debt.<ref>Groppelli, p. 434.</ref> '''Activity ratios''' measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets.<ref name=\"Groppelli, p. 436\">Groppelli, p. 436.</ref> [[Debt ratio]]s measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt.<ref name=\"Groppelli, p. 439\">Groppelli, p. 439.</ref> '''Profitability ratios''' measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return.<ref>Groppelli, p. 442.</ref> '''Market ratios''' measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock.<ref name=\"Groppelli, p. 445\">Groppelli, p. 445.</ref>\nThese are concerned with the return on investment for [[shareholder]]s, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\n\nFinancial ratios allow for comparisons\n* between companies\n* between industries\n* between different time periods for one company\n* between a single company and its industry average\n\nRatios generally are not useful unless they are [[Benchmarking|benchmarked]] against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare.\n\n==Accounting methods and principles==\nFinancial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different [[accounting methods]] or follow various [[standard accounting practice]]s. Most [[public company|public companies]] are required by law to use [[generally accepted accounting principles]] for their home countries, but [[private company|private companies]], [[partnership]]s and [[sole proprietorship]]s may not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country.\n\nThere is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods.\n\n==Abbreviations and terminology==\nVarious abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the [[Internet]]. [[Sales (accounting)|Sales]] reported by a firm are usually [[net sales]], which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an [[invoice]]. [[Net income]] is always the amount ''after'' taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below).\n\nCompanies that are primarily involved in providing services with labour do not generally report \"Sales\" based on hours. These companies tend to report \"revenue\" based on the monetary value of income that the services provide.\n\nNote that Shareholders' Equity and Owner's Equity are ''not'' the same thing, Shareholder's Equity represents the total number of shares in the company multiplied by each share's book value; Owner's Equity represents the total number of shares that an individual shareholder owns (usually the owner with [[controlling interest]]), multiplied by each share's book value. It is important to make this distinction when calculating ratios.\n\n===Abbreviations===\n(''Note: '' These are not ratios, but values in currency.)\n* [[Cost of goods sold|COGS]] = Cost of goods sold, or cost of sales.\n* [[Earnings before interest and taxes|EBIT]] = [[Net income|Earnings]] before [[interest]] and [[taxes]]\n* [[EBITDA]] = Earnings before interest, taxes, [[depreciation]], and [[amortization]]\n* [[Earnings per share|EPS]] = Earnings per share\n\n==Ratios==\n\n===Profitability ratios===\nProfitability ratios measure the company's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return\n:;[[Gross margin]], '''Gross profit margin''' or '''Gross Profit Rate'''<ref>Williams, P. 265.</ref><ref name=\"Williams, p. 1094\">Williams, p. 1094.</ref>\n\n:::<math>\\frac{\\mbox{Gross Profit}}{\\mbox{Net Sales}}</math> :::'''OR''' :::<math>\\frac{\\mbox{Net Sales - COGS}}{\\mbox{Net Sales}}</math>\n\n----\n\n:;[[Operating margin]], '''Operating Income Margin''', '''Operating profit margin''' or '''Return on sales''' (ROS)<ref name=\"Williams, p. 1094\"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Williams |first=Jan R. |author2=Susan F.
