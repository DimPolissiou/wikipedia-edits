The O'Conor family held the throne of the [[Kingdom of Connacht]] up until 1475. Having ruled it on and off since 967, but continuously from 1102\u20131475. However the O'Conor parent house the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain]] and [[S\u00edol Muireadaigh]] ruled [[Connacht]] on many occasions but not continuously between 482 and 956. The house of O'Conor also produced two [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] and his son [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] the Last [[High King of Ireland]].   The family seat is [[Clonalis House]] outside [[Castlerea]] in [[County Roscommon]]. \n\nThe current O'Conor Don is Desmond O'Conor (b. 22 September 1938) who lives in [[Rotherfield]], [[East Sussex]] in England.<ref>Curley, W. Vanishing Kingdoms. Dublin. Lilliput Press.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe \u00d3 Conor ''Don'' is the head of a lineage which provided about one hundred [[Kings of Connacht]],{{cn|date=August 2018}} thirty [[Chief of the Name|Chiefs of the Name]] and two [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]], [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (1088\u20131156), and his son [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] (c. 1115\u20131198), the last High King.. \n\nDuring the late 14th century, the \u00d3 Conor dynasty was grouped into two main divisions, one led by Toirdealbhach Ruadh, the other by Toirdealbhach \u00d3g (also called Toirdealbhach Donn), both in the seventh generation of descent from [[Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair|Cathal Crobhderg]]. From these descended the families of \u00d3 Conchubhair Ruadh (now extinct) and \u00d3 Conchubhair Donn.\n\n== The O'Conor Don line in descent from Sir Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don of Ballintubber Castle==\n{{Tree list}}\n* '''Sir Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don''' of Ballintubber Castle (1541-1632). [[Member of Parliament]] from 1585-86 for Roscommon. Signed a Deed of Composition with [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He was knighted by Lord Deputy [[Sir John Perrott]], and was styled Lord of Connaught. \n** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Calvach O'Conor, The O'Conor Don''' of Ballintubber Castle (1584\u20131655).  He was a candidate for the representation of Roscommon in the parliament of 1613, but was defeated by Sir John King. In 1641 it was rumoured that he was to be made [[King of Connaught]], and his castle of Ballintober was the centre of the [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate party]]. In June 1642 [[Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh|Lord Ranelagh]] attacked him outside Ballintober and routed his army, but did not capture the castle. He was specially excepted from pardon in the act of parliament as to Ireland in 1652, and died in 1655, leaving two sons, Hugh and Charles. His widow, as a transplanted person, obtained, at [[Athlone]] on 8 June 1656, a decree granting her seven hundred acres out of about six thousand.\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don''' of Ballintubber Castle (1617\u20131669). In 1641 he was appointed colonel in the Irish army, and at the siege of Castlecoote in 1642 was captured by [[Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Coote]]. He was examined in Dublin before Sir Robert Meredith, and described the origin of the rising in Connaught in 1641, and stated that he and Sir Lucas Dillon had been appointed to ask [[Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde|Lord Clanricarde]] to take the command of the army in Connaught. He was falsely accused of having murdered one Hugh Cumoghan, servant of Major Ormsby, but was not tried, and, after detention for a year, obtained his liberty, and in July 1652 was one of the Irish officers who entered into articles of surrender with the president of Connaught. In 1653 he was acquitted of the charge of murder, and went abroad and served as a captain in the Duke of Gloucester's regiment. After the Restoration he applied to be reinstated in his castle of Ballintober, co. Roscommon, and an estate of ten thousand acres.

He was awarded only 900 acres of the original land  belonging to his uncle. He was a patron of [[Turlough O'Carolan]], who composed a work in his honour called \"Donagh Cahill Oge\". He composed a number of other pieces in honour of the O'Conor family. It is reported that O'Carolan once said ''I think, that when I am among the O'Conors, the harp has the old sound in it.'' O'Carolan thought Denis's son Charles how to play the harp and much of what we know of O'Carolan is through the diaries of Charles. When O'Carolan died he left  his harp to the O'Conors. Which is on display at [[Clonalis House]].\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} ''[[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor of Bellanagre]]'' (1710-1791). A noted Antiquarian, Historian and Scholar. He was deeply imbued from youth in the native aristocratic literary and cultural tradition, yet his writings were clearly influenced by the Enlightenment and he was as familiar with the works of [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] as he was with [[Gaelic]] lore. He was author of the highly influential ''Dissertations on the Ancient History of Ireland'', first published in 1753. This was the first Irish history written in English by someone who had a command of the surviving Irish and colonial sources and who saw the past from an indigenous perspective. Its publication established O'Conor as the leading living expert on Ireland's history and antiquities. He is also credited with helping to generate an interest in Irish culture, history and antiquities among the Anglo-Irish establishment. He was a founder member in 1785 of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. He also helped to foster a public awareness in English-speaking Ireland of the value of studying Irish, along with its associated poetry and folk-tales. As a [[Roman Catholic]], O'Conor was affected for much of his life by the [[Penal Laws]] - which were intended to break the political power of Irish Catholics and were aimed in particular at the landowning class. Catholic gentry such as the O'Conors were denied access to careers in the army or law and could take no part in government at either national or local level. Many Catholic gentlemen had to go abroad to the Continent to further careers denied them at home.Given this background and his considerable intellectual powers, it is not surprising that O'Conor tried to advance the civil rights of Catholics marginalised by the [[Penal Laws]]. One of the most interesting features of his career was how his antiquarian and historical studies fuelled his political interests and his desire to see the laws eased or repealed. He started to write pamphlets advocating rights for Catholics from at least 1749 onwards. In 1756 he was one of the three founder members of the [[Catholic Convention|Catholic Committee]], which tried to encourage the surviving Catholic gentry and clergy, as well as the emerging merchant class, to agitate peacefully against the Penal Laws. In many ways, the Catholic Committee was the beginning of the peaceful Catholic political activism that was to be so much a feature of nationalist politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}} ''Denis O'Conor'' of Bellnagare (1732-1804).

The O'Conor family held the throne of the [[Kingdom of Connacht]] up until 1475. Having ruled it on and off since 967, but continuously from 1102\u20131475. However the O'Conor parent house the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain]] and [[S\u00edol Muireadaigh]] ruled [[Connacht]] on many occasion but not continuously between 482 and 956. The house of O'Conor also produced two [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] and his son [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] the Last [[High King of Ireland]].   The family seat is [[Clonalis House]] outside [[Castlerea]] in [[County Roscommon]]. \n\nThe current O'Conor Don is Desmond O'Conor (b. 22 September 1938) who lives in [[Rotherfield]], [[East Sussex]] in England.<ref>Curley, W.

From these descended the families of \u00d3 Conchubhair Ruadh (now extinct) and \u00d3 Conchubhair Donn.\n\n== The O'Conor Don line in descent from Sir Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don of Ballintubber Castle==\n{{Tree list}}\n* '''Sir Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don''' of Ballintubber Castle (1541-1632). [[Member of Parliament]] from 1585-86 for Roscommon. Signed a Deed of Composition with [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

He was a candidate for the representation of Roscommon in the parliament of 1613, but was defeated by Sir John King. In 1641 it was rumoured that he was to be made [[King of Connaught]], and his castle of Ballintober was the centre of the [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate party]]. In June 1642 [[Roger Jones, 1st Viscount Ranelagh|Lord Ranelagh]] attacked him outside Ballintober and routed his army, but did not capture the castle. He was specially excepted from pardon in the act of parliament as to Ireland in 1652, and died in 1655, leaving two sons, Hugh and Charles. His widow, as a transplanted person, obtained, at [[Athlone]] on 8 June 1656, a decree granting her seven hundred acres out of about six thousand.\n*** {{Tree list/final branch}} '''Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don''' of Ballintubber Castle (1617\u20131669). In 1641 he was appointed colonel in the Irish army, and at the siege of Castlecoote in 1642 was captured by [[Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Coote]]. He was examined in Dublin before Sir Robert Meredith, and described the origin of the rising in Connaught in 1641, and stated that he and Sir Lucas Dillon had been appointed to ask [[Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde|Lord Clanricarde]] to take the command of the army in Connaught. He was falsely accused of having murdered one Hugh Cumoghan, servant of Major Ormsby, but was not tried, and, after detention for a year, obtained his liberty, and in July 1652 was one of the Irish officers who entered into articles of surrender with the president of Connaught. In 1653 he was acquitted of the charge of murder, and went abroad and served as a captain in the Duke of Gloucester's regiment. After the Restoration he applied to be reinstated in his castle of Ballintober, co. Roscommon, and an estate of ten thousand acres. He died in 1669, before his claim had been decided. \n**** {{Tree list/final branch}}'''Hugh O'Conor, The O'Conor Don'''.

He took legal action against the Government, claiming the had illegally confiscated his inheritance in the form of his uncle's lands. He was awarded only 900 acres of the original land  belonging to his uncle. He was a patron of [[Turlough O'Carolan]], who composed a work in his honour called \"Donagh Cahill Oge\". He composed a number of other pieces in honour of the O'Conor family. It is reported that O'Carolan once said ''I think, that when I am among the O'Conors, the harp has the old sound in it.'' O'Carolan thought Denis's son Charles how to play the harp and much of what we know of O'Carolan is through the diaries of Charles. When O'Carolan died he left  his harp to the O'Conors. Which is on display at [[Clonalis House]].\n***** {{Tree list/final branch}} ''[[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor of Bellanagre]]'' (1710-1791). A noted Antiquarian, Historian and Scholar. He was deeply imbued from youth in the native aristocratic literary and cultural tradition, yet his writings were clearly influenced by the Enlightenment and he was as familiar with the works of [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] as he was with [[Gaelic]] lore. He was author of the highly influential ''Dissertations on the Ancient History of Ireland'', first published in 1753. This was the first Irish history written in English by someone who had a command of the surviving Irish and colonial sources and who saw the past from an indigenous perspective. Its publication established O'Conor as the leading living expert on Ireland's history and antiquities. He is also credited with helping to generate an interest in Irish culture, history and antiquities among the Anglo-Irish establishment. He was a founder member in 1785 of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. He also helped to foster a public awareness in English-speaking Ireland of the value of studying Irish, along with its associated poetry and folk-tales. As a [[Roman Catholic]], O'Conor was affected for much of his life by the [[Penal Laws]] - which were intended to break the political power of Irish Catholics and were aimed in particular at the landowning class. Catholic gentry such as the O'Conors were denied access to careers in the army or law and could take no part in government at either national or local level. Many Catholic gentlemen had to go abroad to the Continent to further careers denied them at home.Given this background and his considerable intellectual powers, it is not surprising that O'Conor tried to advance the civil rights of Catholics marginalised by the [[Penal Laws]]. One of the most interesting features of his career was how his antiquarian and historical studies fuelled his political interests and his desire to see the laws eased or repealed. He started to write pamphlets advocating rights for Catholics from at least 1749 onwards. In 1756 he was one of the three founder members of the [[Catholic Convention|Catholic Committee]], which tried to encourage the surviving Catholic gentry and clergy, as well as the emerging merchant class, to agitate peacefully against the Penal Laws. In many ways, the Catholic Committee was the beginning of the peaceful Catholic political activism that was to be so much a feature of nationalist politics in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n****** {{Tree list/final branch}} ''Denis O'Conor'' of Bellnagare (1732-1804).

Amos's other television work includes ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', a recurring role as [[Percy Fitzwallace|Admiral Percy Fitzwallace]] on ''[[The West Wing]]'', and the role of Washington, D.C. Mayor Ethan Baker in the series ''[[The District]]''. In the 1988 Eddie Murphy film ''[[Coming to America]]'', Amos played Cleo McDowell, the father of [[Shari Headley]]'s character, Lisa McDowell. Amos has appeared on Broadway and in numerous films in his four-decade career. He has been nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and an [[NAACP Image Awards|NAACP Image Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn A.

Unable to run the 40-yard dash because of a pulled hamstring, he was released on the second day of training camp. He then played with the Cleveland Bulldogs and Joliet Explorers of the [[United Football League (1961\u20131964)|United Football League]]. In 1965, he played with the Norfolk Neptunes and Wheeling Ironmen of the [[Continental Football League]]. In 1966, he played with the Jersey City Jets and Waterbury Orbits of the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]].\n\nIn 1967, Amos signed a free agent contract with the [[American Football League]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Coach [[Hank Stram]] told him, \"you're not a football player, you're a man who is trying to play football.\" Amos approached Stram with a poem he wrote about a mythical creature that passes the door of all players who are cut from a team. He read it to the team and received a standing ovation from all the players and coaches. Amos said Stram pushed him in the direction of writing after he was released from training camp. He returned to the Continental League, where he played that year with the Victoria Steelers.\n\n==Acting career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2011}}\nAmos became well known in his first major TV role, playing [[List of other characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Gordy Howard]], the weatherman on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', from 1970 until 1973. In 1971, he appeared with [[Anson Williams]] in a commercial for [[McDonald's]]. But he is best known for his portrayal of [[James Evans, Sr.]], the husband of [[Florida Evans]], first appearing three times on the sitcom ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' before continuing the role in 61 episodes of ''Good Times'' from 1974 to 1976.\n\n===Good Times (1974\u20131979)===\nWhile playing a hard-working middle-aged father of three on the show, Amos was 34 when the show began production in 1973, only eight years older than the actor who played his oldest son ([[Jimmie Walker]]) and 19 years younger than his screen wife ([[Esther Rolle]]). Much like Rolle, Amos wanted to portray a positive image of an African-American family, struggling against the odds in a poor neighborhood, but saw the premise slighted by lower comedy, and expressed dissatisfaction.\n\nIn a 2017 interview, Amos said he had told the writers, who he said did not understand African-Americans, \"That just doesn\u2019t happen in the community. We don\u2019t think that way. We don\u2019t act that way. We don\u2019t let our children do that.' \"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.beaconjournal.com/entertainment/20200206/why-dont-networks-rebroadcast-shows-like-dynasty-and-la-law|title=Why don\u2019t networks rebroadcast shows like \u2018Dynasty\u2019 and \u2018L.A.

(Amos had no issue with Walker himself.) To explain Amos's absence from the show, his character died in a car accident in the first episode of the fourth season and the series continued for three more seasons without him. Lear said Amos had become a disruption, and Amos later agreed, saying he wasn't very diplomatic about his dissatisfaction with the show's direction. Amos had disagreed with the writers emphasizing J.J.'s buffoonishness, including his catchphrases and funny walk, fearing it was turning the program into [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. His character's other son, Michael, wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice, and his daughter, Thelma, a surgeon.\n\n===''Roots'', television roles, stage work===\nIn 1977, Amos appeared in the central role of the adult [[Kunta Kinte]] in the groundbreaking television miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', based on [[Alex Haley]]'s book of the same name. Amos was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] for his performance. In 1980, he starred in the TV film ''[[Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story]]''. Amos played an [[Archie Bunker]]-style character in the 1994 sitcom ''[[704 Hauser]]'', a modern spin-off of ''[[All In The Family]]'', but it was canceled after only five episodes (in the series he played a different character than he did in the ''All in the Family'' spin-off ''Maude''). He also portrayed Captain Dolan on the TV show ''[[Hunter (1984 American TV series)|Hunter]]'' from 1984 to 1985. He co-starred in the [[CBS]] police drama ''[[The District]]''. Amos was a frequent guest on ''[[The West Wing]]'', portraying Admiral [[Percy Fitzwallace]], who serves as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] for most of the show. He played Buzz Washington in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Men in Trees]]''. Amos co-starred with [[Anthony Anderson]] in the short-lived TV series ''[[All About the Andersons]]'' in 2003. In 2010, Amos also appeared as recurring character Ed on ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', and in 2016 as another recurring character, also (coincidentally) named Ed, on the [[Netflix]] sitcom ''[[The Ranch (TV series)|The Ranch]]''. He has guest-starred in a number of other television shows, including ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'', ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' as Sgt. Hamilton Strawn (Tommy's father), ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[Sanford And Son]]'', ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'', ''[[Lie to Me]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.

Amos's other television work includes ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', a recurring role as [[Percy Fitzwallace|Admiral Percy Fitzwallace]] on ''[[The West Wing]]'', and the role of Washington, D.C. Mayor Ethan Baker in the series ''[[The District]]''. In the 1988 Eddie Murphy film ''[[Coming to America]]'', Amos played Cleo McDowell, the father of [[Shari Headley]]'s character, Lisa McDowell.

Unable to run the 40-yard dash because of a pulled hamstring, he was released on the second day of training camp. He then played with the Cleveland Bulldogs and Joliet Explorers of the [[United Football League (1961\u20131964)|United Football League]]. In 1965, he played with the Norfolk Neptunes and Wheeling Ironmen of the [[Continental Football League]]. In 1966, he played with the Jersey City Jets and Waterbury Orbits of the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]].\n\nIn 1967, Amos signed a free agent contract with the [[American Football League]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Coach [[Hank Stram]] told him, \"you're not a football player, you're a man who is trying to play football.\" Amos approached Stram with a poem he wrote about a mythical creature that passes the door of all players who are cut from a team. He read it to the team and received a standing ovation from all the players and coaches. Amos said Stram pushed him in the direction of writing after he was released from training camp. He returned to the Continental League, where he played that year with the Victoria Steelers.\n\n==Acting career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2011}}\nAmos became well known in his first major TV role, playing [[List of other characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show|Gordy Howard]], the weatherman on ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', from 1970 until 1973. In 1971, he appeared with [[Anson Williams]] in a commercial for [[McDonald's]]. But he is best known for his portrayal of [[James Evans, Sr.]], the husband of [[Florida Evans]], first appearing three times on the sitcom ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' before continuing the role in 61 episodes of ''Good Times'' from 1974 to 1976.\n\n===Good Times (1974\u20131979)===\nWhile playing a hard-working middle-aged father of three on the show, Amos was 34 when the show began production in 1973, only eight years older than the actor who played his oldest son ([[Jimmie Walker]]) and 19 years younger than his screen wife ([[Esther Rolle]]). Much like Rolle, Amos wanted to portray a positive image of an African-American family, struggling against the odds in a poor neighborhood, but saw the premise slighted by lower comedy, and expressed dissatisfaction.\n\nIn a 2017 interview, Amos said he had told the writers, who he said did not understand African-Americans, \"That just doesn\u2019t happen in the community. We don\u2019t think that way. We don\u2019t act that way. We don\u2019t let our children do that.' \"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.beaconjournal.com/entertainment/20200206/why-dont-networks-rebroadcast-shows-like-dynasty-and-la-law|title=Why don\u2019t networks rebroadcast shows like \u2018Dynasty\u2019 and \u2018L.A.

(Amos had no issue with Walker himself.) To explain Amos's absence from the show, his character died in a car accident in the first episode of the fourth season and the series continued for three more seasons without him. Lear said Amos had become a disruption, and Amos later agreed, saying he wasn't very diplomatic about his dissatisfaction with the show's direction. Amos had disagreed with the writers emphasizing J.J.'s buffoonishness, including his catchphrases and funny walk, fearing it was turning the program into [[Minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. His character's other son, Michael, wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice, and his daughter, Thelma, a surgeon.\n\n===''Roots'', television roles, stage work===\nIn 1977, Amos appeared in the central role of the adult [[Kunta Kinte]] in the groundbreaking television miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', based on [[Alex Haley]]'s book of the same name. Amos was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]] for his performance. In 1980, he starred in the TV film ''[[Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story]]''. Amos played an [[Archie Bunker]]-style character in the 1994 sitcom ''[[704 Hauser]]'', a modern spin-off of ''[[All In The Family]]'', but it was canceled after only five episodes (in the series he played a different character than he did in the ''All in the Family'' spin-off ''Maude''). He also portrayed Captain Dolan on the TV show ''[[Hunter (1984 American TV series)|Hunter]]'' from 1984 to 1985. He co-starred in the [[CBS]] police drama ''[[The District]]''. Amos was a frequent guest on ''[[The West Wing]]'', portraying Admiral [[Percy Fitzwallace]], who serves as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] for most of the show. He played Buzz Washington in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Men in Trees]]''. Amos co-starred with [[Anthony Anderson]] in the short-lived TV series ''[[All About the Andersons]]'' in 2003. In 2010, Amos also appeared as recurring character Ed on ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', and in 2016 as another recurring character, also (coincidentally) named Ed, on the [[Netflix]] sitcom ''[[The Ranch (TV series)|The Ranch]]''. He has guest-starred in a number of other television shows, including ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[The A-Team]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'', ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'' as Sgt. Hamilton Strawn (Tommy's father), ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', ''[[Sanford And Son]]'', ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'', ''[[Lie to Me]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''.

The helicopter crashed into the sea and sank. Forty-three passengers and two crew members were killed in the crash; one passenger and one crew member survived with wounds.\n\n==History==\nThe helicopter was normally based at [[Aberdeen Airport]] but had been based at [[Sumburgh Airport]] since 3 November 1986 to operate a shuttle service from the Brent oilfield in the [[East Shetland Basin]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Elliott |first1=Harvey |title=45 men killed in Britain's worst helicopter disaster |work=The Times |issue=62,609 |date=7 November 1986 |page=1|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> On 6 November the first flight was delayed due to an oil leak from an engine gearbox that was soon rectified and the aircraft left Sumburgh at 08:58 with 40 passengers for the Brent Field. The aircraft visited three platforms with exchanges of freight and passengers then departed Brent Platform ''C'' at 10:22 with 44 passengers on board for return to Sumburgh Airport. It transited at a height of {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}}, and as it approached Sumburgh it was cleared to descend to {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}}. Reporting {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1}} from the airfield, the controller cleared it to land on helicopter runway 24. Nothing else was heard.\n\n==Accident==\nThe voice recorder indicated that the crew noticed an increased noise level in the flightdeck followed by a bang. Despite applying full [[cyclic pitch]] control, the aircraft did not respond and nose-dived towards the sea from a height of {{convert|150|ft|-1}}. The helicopter hit the sea, broke up and sank. A [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] search and rescue [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|Sikorsky S-61]] helicopter which had just departed Sumburgh Airport on training flight reported [[liferaft]]s in the sea. It then observed a survivor clinging to a substantial piece of wreckage. While they winched the man on board another survivor was noted among the floating bodies. With no signs of other survivors the Coastguard helicopter flew the survivors to Lerwick for transfer to hospital. An air and sea search failed to find any more survivors but all the floating bodies were recovered and brought to the airport. One of the flight crew and the flight attendant were among the dead.\n\n==Recovery==\nA [[diving support vessel]], the MSV ''Deepwater 1'' (now named ''Rockwater 1''), started a search for the sunken wreckage at 09:00 the following morning.  Sea conditions were rough with strong [[tidal current]]s and a water depth around 90 metres but the wreckage was located.  The monohulled ''Deepwater 1'' struggled to maintain position in the building sea and current conditions.  Shell Expro's Multi Services Vessel, the MSV ''Stadive'', arrived and assumed the role of primary recovery vessel and, being a [[semi-submersible]], was able to quickly recover the major components of interest.  By the evening of 10 November the [[cockpit voice recorder]], the cockpit section of the fuselage, the rotors and rotor heads, and the gearboxes and associated control systems had been recovered and transferred to the ''Deepwater 1'', which departed for Aberdeen to pass her cargo onwards for analysis by the [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB).  The ''Stadive'' remained on site and recovered much of the remainder of the fuselage and the bodies of the victims.  In all, 44 of the 45 victims' bodies were recovered.\n\n==Cause==\nThe accident was caused by the failure of a modified bevel ring gear in the forward transmission which allowed the twin rotors to collide when synchronisation was lost.  The AAIB stated that the underlying causes were the inadequacy of a previously accepted test programme and the failure of a stringent inspection programme.\n\n==Safety recommendations==\nThe board made three recommendations:\n\n* Certification procedures be reviewed so that all modifications to vital components are adequately scrutinised and tested before approval and more closely monitored after their introduction into service.\n* The [[Civil Aviation Authority]] should report on the progress that has been made towards the early incorporation of a specification for suitable condition monitoring systems into airworthiness requirements for helicopters and indicate the time scale and scope of likely developments.\n* Requirements relating to the ADELT ([[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|Automatically Deployable Location Transmitter]]) equipment, including location, [[crashworthiness]], protection and power supplied, be reviewed in the light of the accident.  (The beacon did not operate due to impact damage to the aft part of the aircraft.)\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe oil industry decided that the Chinook was too big for the offshore support task and the remaining Chinooks were withdrawn and sold.  All surviving aircraft now operate with [[Columbia Helicopters]] in heavy lift, non-passenger capabilities.\n\n==See also==\nOther North Sea helicopter incidents:\n* [[Bristow Helicopters Flight 56C]] (1995)\n* [[Helikopter Service Flight 451]] (1997)\n* [[Bond Offshore Helicopters Flight 85N]] (2009)\n* [[CHC Helikopter Service Flight 241]] (2016)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite  |publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority |place=Cheltenham |id=CAA 429 |title=World airline accident summary |oclc=7154980}}\n* {{cite  |url=https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/2-1988-boeing-vertol-bv-234-lr-g-bwfc-6-november-1986|place=London |author=[[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] |title=Report on the accident to Boeing Vertol (BV) 234 LR, G-BWFC 2.5 miles east of Sumburgh, Shetland Isles, 6&nbsp;November 1986 |year=1989 |isbn=0-11-550898-8 |publisher=HMSO |id=Report No: 2/1988}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=G-BWFC&distinct_entry=true G-BWFC on Airliners.net]\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 1986}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:British International Helicopters Chinook Crash}}\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1986|British International Helicopters Chinook]]\n[[Category:Aviation in Shetland]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by mechanical failure|British International Helicopters Chinook]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Scotland]]\n[[Category:1986 disasters in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1986 in Scotland|Helicopters Chinook Crash]]\n[[Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing Chinook]]\n[[Category:British International Helicopters accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:November 1986 events in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{No footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n{{Infobox Aircraft accident\n|name=Sumburgh disaster\n|Crash image=British Airways Helicopters Vertol 234 G-BISP.jpg\n|Image caption=The transmission unit had formerly been installed in Boeing-Vertol 234 G-BISP operated by [[British Airways Helicopters]], predecessor to British International Helicopters\n|Date=6 November 1986\n|Type=Mechanical failure\n|occurrence_type=Accident\n|Site=2.5 miles east of [[Sumburgh Airport]]\n|Coordinates = {{Coord|59|53.5|N|1|12|W|display=inline,title}}\n|Fatalities=45\n|Injuries= 2\n|Origin= [[Brent oilfield|Brent]] Platform 'C'\n|Destination= Sumburgh Airport\n|Aircraft Type=[[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Boeing-Vertol 234LR Chinook]]\n|Operator=[[British International Helicopters]]\n|Tail Number=G-BWFC\n|Passengers=44\n|Crew=3\n|Survivors =2\n}}\n\nOn 6 November 1986, a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Boeing-Vertol Model 234LR Chinook]] helicopter returning workers from the [[Brent oilfield]] crashed on approach to land at [[Sumburgh Airport]] in the [[Shetland Islands]].

The AAIB stated that the underlying causes were the inadequacy of a previously accepted test programme and the failure of a stringent inspection programme.\n\n==Safety recommendations==\nThe board made three recommendations:\n\n* Certification procedures be reviewed so that all modifications to vital components are adequately scrutinised and tested before approval and more closely monitored after their introduction into service.\n* The [[Civil Aviation Authority]] should report on the progress that has been made towards the early incorporation of a specification for suitable condition monitoring systems into airworthiness requirements for helicopters and indicate the time scale and scope of likely developments.\n* Requirements relating to the ADELT ([[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|Automatically Deployable Location Transmitter]]) equipment, including location, [[crashworthiness]], protection and power supplied, be reviewed in the light of the accident.  (The beacon did not operate due to impact damage to the aft part of the aircraft.)\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe oil industry decided that the Chinook was too big for the offshore support task and the remaining Chinooks were withdrawn and sold.  All surviving aircraft now operate with [[Columbia Helicopters]] in heavy lift, non-passenger capabilities.\n\n==See also==\nOther North Sea helicopter incidents:\n* [[Bristow Helicopters Flight 56C]] (1995)\n* [[Helikopter Service Flight 451]] (1997)\n* [[Bond Offshore Helicopters Flight 85N]] (2009)\n* [[CHC Helikopter Service Flight 241]] (2016)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite  |publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority |place=Cheltenham |id=CAA 429 |title=World airline accident summary |oclc=7154980}}\n* {{cite  |url=https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/2-1988-boeing-vertol-bv-234-lr-g-bwfc-6-november-1986|place=London |author=[[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] |title=Report on the accident to Boeing Vertol (BV) 234 LR, G-BWFC 2.5 miles east of Sumburgh, Shetland Isles, 6&nbsp;November 1986 |year=1989 |isbn=0-11-550898-8 |publisher=HMSO |id=Report No: 2/1988}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=G-BWFC&distinct_entry=true G-BWFC on Airliners.net]\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 1986}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:British International Helicopters Chinook Crash}}\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1986|British International Helicopters Chinook]]\n[[Category:Aviation in Shetland]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by mechanical failure|British International Helicopters Chinook]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Scotland]]\n[[Category:1986 disasters in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1986 in Scotland|Helicopters Chinook Crash]]\n[[Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing Chinook]]\n[[Category:British International Helicopters accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:November 1986 events in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Plutonium27", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean intro", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_British_International_Helicopters_Chinook_crash"}
