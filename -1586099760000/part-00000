The book surveys English society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era.\n\n''Hard Times'' is unusual in several ways. It is by far the shortest of Dickens' novels, barely a quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it.<ref>Phillip Collins, introduction to ''Hard Times''</ref> Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, ''Hard Times'' has neither a preface nor illustrations. Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London.<ref>Philip Collins, introduction to ''Hard Times'', Everyman's Library, 1992</ref> Instead the story is set in the fictitious [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] industrial Coketown, a generic Northern English mill-town, in some ways similar to [[Manchester]], though smaller. Coketown may be partially based on 19th-century [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].\n\nOne of Dickens's reasons for writing ''Hard Times'' was that sales of his weekly periodical ''[[Household Words]]'' were low, and it was hoped the novel's publication in instalments would boost circulation \u2013 as indeed proved to be the case. Since publication it has received a mixed response from critics. Critics such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Thomas Macaulay]] have mainly focused on Dickens's treatment of trade unions and his post\u2013[[Industrial Revolution]] pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era.  [[F. R. Leavis]], a great admirer of the book, included it \u2013 but not Dickens' work as a whole \u2013 as part of his Great Tradition of English novels.\n\n==Publication==\nThe novel was published as a serial in Dickens's weekly publication, ''[[Household Words]]''. Sales were highly responsive and encouraging for Dickens who remarked that he was \"Three parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at ''Hard Times''\". The novel was serialised, in twenty weekly parts, between 1 April and 12 August 1854. It sold well, and a complete volume was published in August, totalling 110,000 words. Another related novel, ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], was also published in this magazine.\n\n{|\n! Date of publication\n! Chapters\n!

His name is now used generically to refer to someone who is hard and only concerned with cold facts and numbers, a follower of [[Utilitarian]] ideas who neglects the imagination. He soon sees the error of these beliefs however, when his children's lives fall into disarray.\n\n===Mr. Bounderby===\n'''Josiah Bounderby''' is a business associate of Mr. Gradgrind. Given to boasting about being a self-made man, he employs many of the other central characters of the novel. He has risen to a position of power and wealth from humble origins (though not as humble as he claims). He marries Mr. Gradgrind's daughter Louisa, some 30 years his junior, in what turns out to be a loveless marriage. They have no children. Bounderby is callous, self-centred and ultimately revealed to be a liar and fraud.\n\n===Louisa ===\n'''Louisa (Loo) Gradgrind''', later '''Louisa Bounderby''', is the eldest child of the Gradgrind family. She has been taught to suppress her feelings and finds it hard to express herself clearly, saying as a child that she has \"unmanageable thoughts.\"  After her unhappy marriage, she is tempted to adultery by James Harthouse, but resists him and returns to her father. Her rejection of Harthouse leads to a new understanding of life and of the value of emotions and the imagination. She reproaches her father for his dry and fact-based approach to the world and convinces him of the error of his ways.\n\n===Sissy Jupe===\n'''Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe''' is a circus girl of Sleary's circus, as well as a student of Thomas Gradgrind's very strict classroom. Sissy has her own set of values and beliefs which make her seem unintelligent in the Gradgrind household. At the end of the novel, when the Gradgrinds' philosophy of religiously adhering solely to facts breaks down, Sissy is the character who teaches them how to live.\n\nSissy Jupe is first introduced to the readers as Girl Number Twenty in Gradgrind's classroom. She struggles to keep up with Gradgrind's extreme reliance on the recitation of facts, and therefore is seen as not worthy of the school. Sissy is also representative of creativity and wonderment because of her circus background, and those were things that the Gradgrind children were not allowed to engage in. With the urging of Josiah Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind goes to inform Sissy's father that she can no longer attend his school.\n\nGradgrind and Bounderby arrive at the Pegasus' Arms, the Coketown public-house where Sissy, her father, and the rest of Sleary's circus were staying. While Sissy and her father were very close once, Mr. Jupe packed up and abandoned his daughter, leaving Sissy alone. In a moment of compassion, Mr. Gradgrind takes Sissy into his home and gives her a second chance at the school. Sissy continues to fall behind in the school, so Mr. Gradgrind keeps her at home to tend to his invalid wife.\n\nWhile Sissy is the device of imagination and fantasy in the novel, she also serves as the voice of reason. The reason she cannot grasp the philosophy of Gradgrind's classroom is because she actually has a more realistic view of how the world should be perceived. After Louisa and Mr. Gradgrind come to terms with the fact that their way of life is not working, Sissy is the one they come to; she takes care of Louisa and helps her live a new, happy life.\n<ref name=\"Shmoop Editorial Team\">{{cite web|title=Sissy Jupe in Hard Times|url=http://www.shmoop.com/search?q=sissy+jupe|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tom===\n'''Thomas (Tom) Gradgrind, Junior''' is the oldest son and second child of the Gradgrinds. Initially sullen and resentful of his father's Utilitarian education, Tom has a strong relationship with his sister Louisa. He works in Bounderby's bank (which he later robs), and turns to gambling and drinking. Louisa never ceases to adore Tom, and she aids Sissy and Mr. Gradgrind in saving her brother from arrest.\n\n===Stephen Blackpool===\n'''Stephen Blackpool''' is a worker at one of Bounderby's mills. He has a drunken wife who no longer lives with him but who appears from time to time. He forms a close bond with Rachael, a co-worker, whom he wishes to marry. After a dispute with Bounderby, he is dismissed from his work at the Coketown mills and, shunned by his former fellow workers, is forced to look for work elsewhere. While absent from Coketown, he is wrongly accused of robbing Bounderby's bank. On his way back to vindicate himself, he falls down a mine-shaft. He is rescued but dies of his injuries.\n\n===Other characters===\n'''Bitzer''' \u2013 is a very pale classmate of Sissy's who is brought up on facts and taught to operate according to self-interest. He takes up a job in Bounderby's bank, and later tries to arrest Tom.\n\n'''Rachael''' \u2013 is the friend of Stephen Blackpool who attests to his innocence when he is accused of robbing Bounderby's bank by Tom. She is a factory worker, childhood friend of Blackpool's drunken and often absent wife, and becomes the literary tool for bringing the two parallel story lines together at the brink of Hell's Shaft in the final book.\n\n'''Mrs. Sparsit''' \u2013 is a widow who has fallen on hard times. She is employed by Bounderby, and is jealous when he marries Louisa, delighting in the belief that Louisa is later about to elope with James Harthouse. Her machinations are unsuccessful and she is ultimately sacked by Bounderby.\n\n'''James Harthouse''' \u2013 is an indolent, languid, upper-class gentleman, who attempts to woo Louisa.\n\n'''Mrs. Gradgrind''' \u2013 the wife of Mr. Gradgrind, is an invalid who constantly complains. Tom Sr.'s apparent attraction to her is because  she totally lacks 'fancy,' though she also appears to be unintelligent and without empathy for her children.\n\n'''Mr. Sleary''' - the owner of the circus which employs Sissy's father. He speaks with a lisp. A kind man, he helps both Sissy and young Tom when they are in trouble.\n\n'''Mrs. Pegler''' - an old woman who sometimes visits Coketown to observe the Bounderby estate. She is later revealed to be Bounderby's mother, proving his \"rags-to-riches\" story to be fraudulent.\n\n'''Jane Gradgrind''' - a younger sister of Tom and Louisa Gradgrind who spends a lot of time with Sissy Jupe. She is cheerful, affectionate and despite looking similar to Louisa, in personality she is opposite.\n\n==Major themes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\nDickens wished to educate readers about the working conditions of some of the factories in the industrial towns of [[Manchester]], and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], to \"strike the heaviest blow in my power\", and as well to confront the assumption that prosperity runs parallel to morality. This notion he systematically deconstructed in through his portrayal of the moral monsters, Mr. Bounderby and James Harthouse. Dickens also believed in the importance of the imagination, and that people's lives should not be reduced to a collection of material facts and statistics. The description of the circus, which he describes as caring so \"little for Plain Fact\", is an example of this.\n\n===Utilitarianism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nThe [[List of Utilitarians|Utilitarians]] were one of the targets of Dickens' satire. [[Utilitarianism]] was a prevalent school of thought during this period, its founders being [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], father to political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]]. \nBentham's former secretary, [[Edwin Chadwick]], helped design the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law of 1834]], which deliberately made workhouse life as uncomfortable as possible. In the novel, this attitude is conveyed in Bitzer's response to Gradgrind's appeal for compassion.\n\nDickens was appalled by what he saw as a selfish philosophy, which was combined with materialist ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the education of some children at the time, as well as in industrial practices. In Dickens's interpretation, the prevalence of utilitarian values in educational institutions promoted contempt between mill owners and workers, creating young adults whose imaginations had been neglected, due to an over-emphasis on facts at the expense of more imaginative pursuits.\n\nDickens wished to satirise radical Utilitarians whom he described in a letter to [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] as \"see[ing] figures and averages, and nothing else.\" He also wished to campaign for reform of [[List of topics on working time and conditions|working conditions]]. Dickens had visited factories in [[Manchester]] as early as 1839, and was appalled by the environment in which workers toiled. Drawing upon his own childhood experiences, Dickens resolved to \"strike the heaviest blow in my power\" for those who laboured in horrific conditions.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill had a similar, rigorous education to that of Louisa Gradgrind, consisting of analytical, logical, mathematical, and statistical exercises. In his twenties, Mill had a nervous breakdown, believing his capacity for emotion had been enervated by his father's stringent emphasis on analysis and mathematics in his education. In the book, Louisa herself follows a parallel course, being unable to express herself and falling into a temporary depression as a result of her dry education.\n\n===Fact vs. Fancy===\nThe bastion of fact is the eminently practical Mr. Gradgrind, and his model school, which teaches nothing but \"[[Fact]]s\". Any [[imaginative]] or [[aesthetic]] subjects are absent from the curriculum, and analysis, deduction and mathematics are emphasised. Fancy, the opposite of Fact, is epitomised by Sleary's circus. Sleary is reckoned a fool by Gradgrind and Bounderby, but it is Sleary who understands that people must be amused. Sissy, the circus performer's daughter, does badly at school, failing to remember the many facts she is taught, but is  genuinely virtuous and fulfilled. Gradgrind's own son Tom revolts against his upbringing, and becomes a gambler and a thief, while Louisa becomes emotionally stunted, virtually [[soul]]less both as a young child and as an unhappily married woman. Bitzer, who adheres to Gradgrind's teachings, becomes an uncompassionate [[egotist]].\n\n===Officiousness and spying===\nMr. Bounderby spends his whole time fabricating stories about his childhood, covering up the real nature of his upbringing, which is revealed at the end of the novel. While not a snooper himself, he is undone by Sparsit unwittingly revealing the mysterious old woman to be his own mother, and she unravels Josiah's secrets about his upbringing and fictitious stories. Mr. Bounderby himself superintends through calculating tabular statements and statistics, and is always secretly rebuking the people of Coketown for indulging in conceitful activities. This gives Bounderby a sense of superiority, as it does with Mrs. Sparsit, who prides herself on her salacious knowledge gained from spying on others. Bounderby's grasp for superiority is seen in Blackpool's talks to Bounderby regarding divorce proceedings and a union movement at his factory, accusing him that he is on a quest 'to feast on turtle soup and venison, served with a golden spoon.' All \"superintendents\" of the novel are undone in one way or another.\n\n===Morality===\nDickens portrays the wealthy in this novel as being morally corrupt. Bounderby has no moral scruples, and, for example, fires  Blackpool \"for a novelty\". He also conducts himself without any shred of decency, frequently losing his temper. He is cynically false about his childhood. Harthouse, a leisured gent, is compared to an \"iceberg\" who will cause a wreck unwittingly, due to him being \"not a moral sort of fellow\", as he states himself. Stephen Blackpool, a destitute worker, is equipped with perfect morals, always abiding by his promises, and always thoughtful and considerate of others, as is Sissy Jupe.\n\n====The role of status on morality====\nDickens is also concerned, throughout ''Hard Times'', with the effects of social class on the morality of individuals. Some contrasting characters relating to this theme are Stephen and Rachel, and Tom and Mr. Bounderby. Stephen's honesty and Rachel's caring actions are qualities not shown in people from higher classes, but among hard working individuals who are browbeaten by the uncaring factory owners such as Bounderby. These qualities appear repeatedly, as Stephen works hard every day, until he decides to leave town to save the names of his fellow workers, and Rachel supports Stephen through this, while struggling to provide for herself as well. In contrast to these behaviours, Mr. Bounderby refuses to recognise the difficulties faced by those in lower classes, as seen by him completely casting aside Stephen's request for help. Other aristocratic characters simply carry out blatantly immoral actions, such as Tom throwing away his sister's money, falling into debt, then robbing a bank, and even framing someone else for his actions. Tom is also seen to be deceitful as he is able to keep his guilt hidden until the evidence points only toward him. On the contrary, when the news comes out that Stephen had robbed the bank, Stephen begins to head back to Coketown to face his problems and clear his name. Overall, the stark difference in morality between characters of dissimilar social status suggests Dickens' idea that there is a form of innate natural law that may remain unhampered in those leading less titled lives. Stephen's concept of right and wrong is untainted by the manufactured values of utilitarianism, instilled into Tom and Bounderby.\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n[[Image:George bernard shaw.jpg|150px|thumb|[[George Bernard Shaw]] was critical of the book's message.]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[Literary criticism|Critics]] have had diverse opinions on the novel. [[John Ruskin]] declared ''Hard Times'' to be his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. However, [[Thomas Macaulay]] branded it \"sullen socialism\", on the grounds that Dickens did not fully comprehend the politics of the time. [[George Bernard Shaw]] argued  ''Hard Times'' to be a novel of \"passionate revolt against the whole industrial order of the modern world.\"  But he criticised the novel for failing to provide an accurate account of [[trade unionism]] of the time, arguing that Slackbridge, the poisonous orator, was \"a mere figment of middle-class imagination.\" Believing that it was very different from Dickens's other novels, Shaw also said: \"Many readers find the change disappointing. Others find Dickens worth reading almost for the first time.\" <ref>George Bernard Shaw, quoted in ''Hard Times: The Dickens Critics'', 1966.</ref>\n\n[[F. R. Leavis]], in ''The Great Tradition'', described the book as essentially a moral fable, and that 'of all Dickens' works (it is) the one that has all the strengths of his genius \u2013 that of a completely serious work of art'.<ref>F. R. Leavis, ''The Great Tradition'', 1948</ref> This, however, was a view which he later revised in ''Dickens the Novelist'', which recognised that Dickens's strengths and artistry appeared fully in other works.\n\n[[Walter Allen]] characterised ''Hard Times'' as being an unsurpassed \"critique of industrial society\", which was later superseded by works of [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Other writers have described the novel as being, as [[G. K. Chesterton]] commented in his work ''Appreciations and Criticisms'', \"the harshest of his stories\"; whereas [[George Orwell]] praised the novel (and Dickens himself) for \"generous anger\".\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted as a 1915 silent film, ''[[Hard Times (1915 film)|Hard Times]]'', directed by [[Thomas Bentley]].\n\nIn 1988 Portuguese director [[Jo\u00e3o Botelho]] adapted the novel to the big screen in ''[[Hard Times (1988 film)|Hard Times]]'' (shot entirely in black & white) transferring the action to an unspecified industrial Portuguese city of the 1980s.\n\n''Hard Times'' has been adapted twice for BBC Radio, first in 1998 starring [[John Woodvine]] as Gradgrind, [[Tom Baker]] as Josiah Bounderby and [[Anna Massey]] as Mrs. Sparsit, and again in 2007 starring [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Gradgrind, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as Bounderby, [[Alan Williams (actor)|Alan Williams]] as Stephen, [[Becky Hindley]] as Rachael, [[Helen Longworth]] as Louisa, [[Richard Firth]] as Tom and [[Eleanor Bron]] as Mrs. Sparsit.\n\nIn the theatre, ''Hard Times'' was adapted for the stage by Michael O'Brien and directed by [[Marti Maraden]] at Canada's [[National Arts Centre]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.playwrightscanada.com/index.php/michael-o-brien.html |title=Playwrights Canada Press Ltd |access-date=17 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019003748/http://www.playwrightscanada.com/index.php/michael-o-brien.html |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2018 [[Northern Broadsides]] toured an adaptation written by [[Deb McAndrew]] and directed by [[Conrad Nelson]].<ref name=\"northernb\">{{cite web|title=Hard Times|url=https://www.northern-broadsides.co.uk/hard-times/|publisher=Northern Broadsides|accessdate=4 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"gardner\">{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Lyn|title=Hard Times review \u2013 Northern Broadsides make Dickens a laugh factory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/22/hard-times-review-northern-broadsides-dickens-halifax-viaduct|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=The Guardian|date=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe novel has also been adapted twice as a mini-series for British television, once in 1977 with [[Patrick Allen]] as Gradgrind, [[Timothy West]] as Bounderby, [[Rosalie Crutchley]] as Mrs. Sparsit and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Harthouse, and again in 1994 with [[Bob Peck]] as Gradgrind, [[Alan Bates]] as Bounderby, [[Dilys Laye]] as Mrs. Sparsit, [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Stephen, [[Harriet Walter]] as Rachael and [[Richard E.

The book surveys English society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era.\n\n''Hard Times'' is unusual in several ways. It is by far the shortest of Dickens' novels, barely a quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it.<ref>Phillip Collins, introduction to ''Hard Times''</ref> Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, ''Hard Times'' has neither a preface nor illustrations. Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London.<ref>Philip Collins, introduction to ''Hard Times'', Everyman's Library, 1992</ref> Instead the story is set in the fictitious [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] industrial Coketown, a generic Northern English mill-town, in some ways similar to [[Manchester]], though smaller. Coketown may be partially based on 19th-century [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].\n\nOne of Dickens's reasons for writing ''Hard Times'' was that sales of his weekly periodical ''[[Household Words]]'' were low, and it was hoped the novel's publication in instalments would boost circulation \u2013 as indeed proved to be the case. Since publication it has received a mixed response from critics. Critics such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Thomas Macaulay]] have mainly focused on Dickens's treatment of trade unions and his post\u2013[[Industrial Revolution]] pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era.  [[F. R. Leavis]], a great admirer of the book, included it \u2013 but not Dickens' work as a whole \u2013 as part of his Great Tradition of English novels.\n\n==Publication==\nThe novel was published as a serial in Dickens's weekly publication, ''[[Household Words]]''. Sales were highly responsive and encouraging for Dickens who remarked that he was \"Three parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at ''Hard Times''\". The novel was serialised, in twenty weekly parts, between 1 April and 12 August 1854. It sold well, and a complete volume was published in August, totalling 110,000 words. Another related novel, ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' by [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], was also published in this magazine.\n\n{|\n! Date of publication\n! Chapters\n!

His name is now used generically to refer to someone who is hard and only concerned with cold facts and numbers, a follower of [[Utilitarian]] ideas who neglects the imagination. He soon sees the error of these beliefs however, when his children's lives fall into disarray.\n\n===Mr. Bounderby===\n'''Josiah Bounderby''' is a business associate of Mr. Gradgrind. Given to boasting about being a self-made man, he employs many of the other central characters of the novel. He has risen to a position of power and wealth from humble origins (though not as humble as he claims). He marries Mr. Gradgrind's daughter Louisa, some 30 years his junior, in what turns out to be a loveless marriage. They have no children. Bounderby is callous, self-centred and ultimately revealed to be a liar and fraud.\n\n===Louisa ===\n'''Louisa (Loo) Gradgrind''', later '''Louisa Bounderby''', is the eldest child of the Gradgrind family. She has been taught to suppress her feelings and finds it hard to express herself clearly, saying as a child that she has \"unmanageable thoughts.\"  After her unhappy marriage, she is tempted to adultery by James Harthouse, but resists him and returns to her father. Her rejection of Harthouse leads to a new understanding of life and of the value of emotions and the imagination. She reproaches her father for his dry and fact-based approach to the world and convinces him of the error of his ways.\n\n===Sissy Jupe===\n'''Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe''' is a circus girl of Sleary's circus, as well as a student of Thomas Gradgrind's very strict classroom. Sissy has her own set of values and beliefs which make her seem unintelligent in the Gradgrind household. At the end of the novel, when the Gradgrinds' philosophy of religiously adhering solely to facts breaks down, Sissy is the character who teaches them how to live.\n\nSissy Jupe is first introduced to the readers as Girl Number Twenty in Gradgrind's classroom. She struggles to keep up with Gradgrind's extreme reliance on the recitation of facts, and therefore is seen as not worthy of the school. Sissy is also representative of creativity and wonderment because of her circus background, and those were things that the Gradgrind children were not allowed to engage in. With the urging of Josiah Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind goes to inform Sissy's father that she can no longer attend his school.\n\nGradgrind and Bounderby arrive at the Pegasus' Arms, the Coketown public-house where Sissy, her father, and the rest of Sleary's circus were staying. While Sissy and her father were very close once, Mr. Jupe packed up and abandoned his daughter, leaving Sissy alone. In a moment of compassion, Mr. Gradgrind takes Sissy into his home and gives her a second chance at the school. Sissy continues to fall behind in the school, so Mr. Gradgrind keeps her at home to tend to his invalid wife.\n\nWhile Sissy is the device of imagination and fantasy in the novel, she also serves as the voice of reason. The reason she cannot grasp the philosophy of Gradgrind's classroom is because she actually has a more realistic view of how the world should be perceived. After Louisa and Mr. Gradgrind come to terms with the fact that their way of life is not working, Sissy is the one they come to; she takes care of Louisa and helps her live a new, happy life.\n<ref name=\"Shmoop Editorial Team\">{{cite web|title=Sissy Jupe in Hard Times|url=http://www.shmoop.com/search?q=sissy+jupe|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Tom===\n'''Thomas (Tom) Gradgrind, Junior''' is the oldest son and second child of the Gradgrinds. Initially sullen and resentful of his father's Utilitarian education, Tom has a strong relationship with his sister Louisa. He works in Bounderby's bank (which he later robs), and turns to gambling and drinking. Louisa never ceases to adore Tom, and she aids Sissy and Mr. Gradgrind in saving her brother from arrest.\n\n===Stephen Blackpool===\n'''Stephen Blackpool''' is a worker at one of Bounderby's mills. He has a drunken wife who no longer lives with him but who appears from time to time. He forms a close bond with Rachael, a co-worker, whom he wishes to marry. After a dispute with Bounderby, he is dismissed from his work at the Coketown mills and, shunned by his former fellow workers, is forced to look for work elsewhere. While absent from Coketown, he is wrongly accused of robbing Bounderby's bank. On his way back to vindicate himself, he falls down a mine-shaft. He is rescued but dies of his injuries.\n\n===Other characters===\n'''Bitzer''' \u2013 is a very pale classmate of Sissy's who is brought up on facts and taught to operate according to self-interest. He takes up a job in Bounderby's bank, and later tries to arrest Tom.\n\n'''Rachael''' \u2013 is the friend of Stephen Blackpool who attests to his innocence when he is accused of robbing Bounderby's bank by Tom. She is a factory worker, childhood friend of Blackpool's drunken and often absent wife, and becomes the literary tool for bringing the two parallel story lines together at the brink of Hell's Shaft in the final book.\n\n'''Mrs. Sparsit''' \u2013 is a widow who has fallen on hard times. She is employed by Bounderby, and is jealous when he marries Louisa, delighting in the belief that Louisa is later about to elope with James Harthouse. Her machinations are unsuccessful and she is ultimately sacked by Bounderby.\n\n'''James Harthouse''' \u2013 is an indolent, languid, upper-class gentleman, who attempts to woo Louisa.\n\n'''Mrs. Gradgrind''' \u2013 the wife of Mr. Gradgrind, is an invalid who constantly complains. Tom Sr.'s apparent attraction to her is because  she totally lacks 'fancy,' though she also appears to be unintelligent and without empathy for her children.\n\n'''Mr. Sleary''' - the owner of the circus which employs Sissy's father. He speaks with a lisp. A kind man, he helps both Sissy and young Tom when they are in trouble.\n\n'''Mrs. Pegler''' - an old woman who sometimes visits Coketown to observe the Bounderby estate. She is later revealed to be Bounderby's mother, proving his \"rags-to-riches\" story to be fraudulent.\n\n'''Jane Gradgrind''' - a younger sister of Tom and Louisa Gradgrind who spends a lot of time with Sissy Jupe. She is cheerful, affectionate and despite looking similar to Louisa, in personality she is opposite.\n\n==Major themes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\nDickens wished to educate readers about the working conditions of some of the factories in the industrial towns of [[Manchester]], and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], to \"strike the heaviest blow in my power\", and as well to confront the assumption that prosperity runs parallel to morality. This notion he systematically deconstructed in through his portrayal of the moral monsters, Mr. Bounderby and James Harthouse. Dickens also believed in the importance of the imagination, and that people's lives should not be reduced to a collection of material facts and statistics. The description of the circus, which he describes as caring so \"little for Plain Fact\", is an example of this.\n\n===Utilitarianism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nThe [[List of Utilitarians|Utilitarians]] were one of the targets of Dickens' satire. [[Utilitarianism]] was a prevalent school of thought during this period, its founders being [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], father to political theorist [[John Stuart Mill]]. \nBentham's former secretary, [[Edwin Chadwick]], helped design the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law of 1834]], which deliberately made workhouse life as uncomfortable as possible. In the novel, this attitude is conveyed in Bitzer's response to Gradgrind's appeal for compassion.\n\nDickens was appalled by what he saw as a selfish philosophy, which was combined with materialist ''laissez-faire'' capitalism in the education of some children at the time, as well as in industrial practices. In Dickens's interpretation, the prevalence of utilitarian values in educational institutions promoted contempt between mill owners and workers, creating young adults whose imaginations had been neglected, due to an over-emphasis on facts at the expense of more imaginative pursuits.\n\nDickens wished to satirise radical Utilitarians whom he described in a letter to [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]] as \"see[ing] figures and averages, and nothing else.\" He also wished to campaign for reform of [[List of topics on working time and conditions|working conditions]]. Dickens had visited factories in [[Manchester]] as early as 1839, and was appalled by the environment in which workers toiled. Drawing upon his own childhood experiences, Dickens resolved to \"strike the heaviest blow in my power\" for those who laboured in horrific conditions.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill had a similar, rigorous education to that of Louisa Gradgrind, consisting of analytical, logical, mathematical, and statistical exercises. In his twenties, Mill had a nervous breakdown, believing his capacity for emotion had been enervated by his father's stringent emphasis on analysis and mathematics in his education. In the book, Louisa herself follows a parallel course, being unable to express herself and falling into a temporary depression as a result of her dry education.\n\n===Fact vs. Fancy===\nThe bastion of fact is the eminently practical Mr. Gradgrind, and his model school, which teaches nothing but \"[[Fact]]s\". Any [[imaginative]] or [[aesthetic]] subjects are absent from the curriculum, and analysis, deduction and mathematics are emphasised. Fancy, the opposite of Fact, is epitomised by Sleary's circus. Sleary is reckoned a fool by Gradgrind and Bounderby, but it is Sleary who understands that people must be amused. Sissy, the circus performer's daughter, does badly at school, failing to remember the many facts she is taught, but is  genuinely virtuous and fulfilled. Gradgrind's own son Tom revolts against his upbringing, and becomes a gambler and a thief, while Louisa becomes emotionally stunted, virtually [[soul]]less both as a young child and as an unhappily married woman. Bitzer, who adheres to Gradgrind's teachings, becomes an uncompassionate [[egotist]].\n\n===Officiousness and spying===\nMr. Bounderby spends his whole time fabricating stories about his childhood, covering up the real nature of his upbringing, which is revealed at the end of the novel. While not a snooper himself, he is undone by Sparsit unwittingly revealing the mysterious old woman to be his own mother, and she unravels Josiah's secrets about his upbringing and fictitious stories. Mr. Bounderby himself superintends through calculating tabular statements and statistics, and is always secretly rebuking the people of Coketown for indulging in conceitful activities. This gives Bounderby a sense of superiority, as it does with Mrs. Sparsit, who prides herself on her salacious knowledge gained from spying on others. Bounderby's grasp for superiority is seen in Blackpool's talks to Bounderby regarding divorce proceedings and a union movement at his factory, accusing him that he is on a quest 'to feast on turtle soup and venison, served with a golden spoon.' All \"superintendents\" of the novel are undone in one way or another.\n\n===Morality===\nDickens portrays the wealthy in this novel as being morally corrupt. Bounderby has no moral scruples, and, for example, fires  Blackpool \"for a novelty\". He also conducts himself without any shred of decency, frequently losing his temper. He is cynically false about his childhood. Harthouse, a leisured gent, is compared to an \"iceberg\" who will cause a wreck unwittingly, due to him being \"not a moral sort of fellow\", as he states himself. Stephen Blackpool, a destitute worker, is equipped with perfect morals, always abiding by his promises, and always thoughtful and considerate of others, as is Sissy Jupe.\n\n====The role of status on morality====\nDickens is also concerned, throughout ''Hard Times'', with the effects of social class on the morality of individuals. Some contrasting characters relating to this theme are Stephen and Rachel, and Tom and Mr. Bounderby. Stephen's honesty and Rachel's caring actions are qualities not shown in people from higher classes, but among hard working individuals who are browbeaten by the uncaring factory owners such as Bounderby. These qualities appear repeatedly, as Stephen works hard every day, until he decides to leave town to save the names of his fellow workers, and Rachel supports Stephen through this, while struggling to provide for herself as well. In contrast to these behaviours, Mr. Bounderby refuses to recognise the difficulties faced by those in lower classes, as seen by him completely casting aside Stephen's request for help. Other aristocratic characters simply carry out blatantly immoral actions, such as Tom throwing away his sister's money, falling into debt, then robbing a bank, and even framing someone else for his actions. Tom is also seen to be deceitful as he is able to keep his guilt hidden until the evidence points only toward him. On the contrary, when the news comes out that Stephen had robbed the bank, Stephen begins to head back to Coketown to face his problems and clear his name. Overall, the stark difference in morality between characters of dissimilar social status suggests Dickens' idea that there is a form of innate natural law that may remain unhampered in those leading less titled lives. Stephen's concept of right and wrong is untainted by the manufactured values of utilitarianism, instilled into Tom and Bounderby.\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n[[Image:George bernard shaw.jpg|150px|thumb|[[George Bernard Shaw]] was critical of the book's message.]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[Literary criticism|Critics]] have had diverse opinions on the novel. [[John Ruskin]] declared ''Hard Times'' to be his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. However, [[Thomas Macaulay]] branded it \"sullen socialism\", on the grounds that Dickens did not fully comprehend the politics of the time. [[George Bernard Shaw]] argued  ''Hard Times'' to be a novel of \"passionate revolt against the whole industrial order of the modern world.\"  But he criticised the novel for failing to provide an accurate account of [[trade unionism]] of the time, arguing that Slackbridge, the poisonous orator, was \"a mere figment of middle-class imagination.\" Believing that it was very different from Dickens's other novels, Shaw also said: \"Many readers find the change disappointing. Others find Dickens worth reading almost for the first time.\" <ref>George Bernard Shaw, quoted in ''Hard Times: The Dickens Critics'', 1966.</ref>\n\n[[F. R. Leavis]], in ''The Great Tradition'', described the book as essentially a moral fable, and that 'of all Dickens' works (it is) the one that has all the strengths of his genius \u2013 that of a completely serious work of art'.<ref>F. R. Leavis, ''The Great Tradition'', 1948</ref> This, however, was a view which he later revised in ''Dickens the Novelist'', which recognised that Dickens's strengths and artistry appeared fully in other works.\n\n[[Walter Allen]] characterised ''Hard Times'' as being an unsurpassed \"critique of industrial society\", which was later superseded by works of [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Other writers have described the novel as being, as [[G. K. Chesterton]] commented in his work ''Appreciations and Criticisms'', \"the harshest of his stories\"; whereas [[George Orwell]] praised the novel (and Dickens himself) for \"generous anger\".\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted as a 1915 silent film, ''[[Hard Times (1915 film)|Hard Times]]'', directed by [[Thomas Bentley]].\n\nIn 1988 Portuguese director [[Jo\u00e3o Botelho]] adapted the novel to the big screen in ''[[Hard Times (1988 film)|Hard Times]]'' (shot entirely in black & white) transferring the action to an unspecified industrial Portuguese city of the 1980s.\n\n''Hard Times'' has been adapted twice for BBC Radio, first in 1998 starring [[John Woodvine]] as Gradgrind, [[Tom Baker]] as Josiah Bounderby and [[Anna Massey]] as Mrs. Sparsit, and again in 2007 starring [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Gradgrind, [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as Bounderby, [[Alan Williams (actor)|Alan Williams]] as Stephen, [[Becky Hindley]] as Rachael, [[Helen Longworth]] as Louisa, [[Richard Firth]] as Tom and [[Eleanor Bron]] as Mrs. Sparsit.\n\nIn the theatre, ''Hard Times'' was adapted for the stage by Michael O'Brien and directed by [[Marti Maraden]] at Canada's [[National Arts Centre]] in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.playwrightscanada.com/index.php/michael-o-brien.html |title=Playwrights Canada Press Ltd |access-date=17 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019003748/http://www.playwrightscanada.com/index.php/michael-o-brien.html |archive-date=19 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2018 [[Northern Broadsides]] toured an adaptation written by [[Deb McAndrew]] and directed by [[Conrad Nelson]].<ref name=\"northernb\">{{cite web|title=Hard Times|url=https://www.northern-broadsides.co.uk/hard-times/|publisher=Northern Broadsides|accessdate=4 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"gardner\">{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Lyn|title=Hard Times review \u2013 Northern Broadsides make Dickens a laugh factory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/feb/22/hard-times-review-northern-broadsides-dickens-halifax-viaduct|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=The Guardian|date=22 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe novel has also been adapted twice as a mini-series for British television, once in 1977 with [[Patrick Allen]] as Gradgrind, [[Timothy West]] as Bounderby, [[Rosalie Crutchley]] as Mrs. Sparsit and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Harthouse, and again in 1994 with [[Bob Peck]] as Gradgrind, [[Alan Bates]] as Bounderby, [[Dilys Laye]] as Mrs. Sparsit, [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Stephen, [[Harriet Walter]] as Rachael and [[Richard E.
