Bernandoni and Pasini did not receive the gauges and steering wheel with the car. They did, however, receive several proposals to modify the car into running condition and accepted one. During the modification process, the car's colour was changed from its original pale blue to deep metallic green at the owner's request.{{r|RT1994_05p127}}\n\nThe 350 GTV was then sold to a Japanese collector, who placed the car in the Noritake Collection.
